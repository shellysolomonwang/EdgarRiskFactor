Item 1A. Risk Factors  As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.  MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS  Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets may cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, could cause:         •  the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;         •  the withdrawal of funds from BlackRock’s products in favor of products offered by competitors;         •  the rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;         •  an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or         •  a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.  The occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients or fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.  BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its investment advisory business. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of private investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as a fund’s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its U.S. mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock’s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be subject to reduction (including at the behest of a fund’s board of directors). In addition, if a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, remove BlackRock from advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  The investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, have altered the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to fee compression or require BlackRock to spend more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with products and services offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  18  Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.  The sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via the Aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients are an important element of BlackRock’s competitive success. Aladdin’s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine sophisticated risk analytics with comprehensive portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers or a shift in client demand away to standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin’s competitive position and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in Aladdin. The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance.  Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings.  At December 31, 2016, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $1.5 billion in its investments (see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments and Investments of Consolidated VIEs”) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as other minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and cause earnings to decline. Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses.  BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage any such risks.  BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.  BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client’s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower’s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities on loan to mitigate the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2016 and subject to indemnification was $169.3 billion. BlackRock held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $180.1 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2016. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company’s revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, as well as regulatory restrictions on the Company’s ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Increased geopolitical unrest could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility, both within the United States and abroad, as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. Global unrest or conflict or acts of terror, as well as any changes in the current geopolitical environment, may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 19  Risks Related to INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE  Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:         •  client withdrawals in favor of better performing products;         •  client shifts to products that charge lower fees;        •  the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;         •  reduced, minimal or no performance fees;         •  an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or         •  a decrease in investment returns on seed and co-investment capital.  Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.  A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $295 million, or 3%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement pursuant to which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company’s future revenue and earnings may also increase as BlackRock takes on more advisory assignments for illiquid investments, where fees are generally realized and recognized over substantially longer periods than those associated with more liquid products.  Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships.  BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock’s business and reputation.  TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS  A failure in BlackRock’s operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation and cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth. Notwithstanding BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and/or sanctions.  A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus, phishing scam or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, BlackRock’s increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock’s control. BlackRock’s reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available. There have been a number of recent highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments.  BlackRock has been the target of attempted cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand to create fraudulent websites, and must continuously monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock’s operations and cause financial losses. In addition, due to BlackRock’s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile and cloud technologies. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The  20  Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock cannot ensure that it or such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information.  Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations and could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.  BlackRock relies on its ability to maintain a robust and secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. The analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin analytical calculations. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or information, or disruption of such information flows, could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients.  Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.  BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its ability to maintain and grow its AUM, creditworthiness and operating cash flows. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.  BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to additional costs or operational risk.  BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services require continued innovative efforts on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. A failure to innovate, or introduce new products and services, or to successfully manage the risks associated with such products and services may cause BlackRock’s costs to fluctuate, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Future inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.  BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, and acquiring investment management businesses and other small and medium-sized companies. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities. Any failure to identify and mitigate these risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation, may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, and may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry. Moreover, there can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from future inorganic transactions.  Investments in real assets such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm.  Investments in real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such assets. These may include:        •  construction risks, including labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment;        •  accidents, adverse weather, force majeure or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock’s control;        •  personal injury or property damage;         •  failures on the part of third-party managers or sub-contractors appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws;         •  exposure to stringent and complex foreign, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection;         •  environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants;        •  changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities;  21         •  the financial resources of tenants; and        •  contingent liabilities on disposition of assets. The above risks may expose BlackRock’s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation costs, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock’s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to regulatory sanction or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests that make such development or project less attractive than at the time it was commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock’s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management’s attention away from BlackRock’s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, political, regulatory and other risks.  As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.    RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock’s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.    Many of BlackRock’s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company’s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock’s operations are ultimately dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to follow protocols or report issues or errors in judgment. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or sanctions, or damage BlackRock’s reputation and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Fraud, or the circumvention of controls and risk management policies, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Although BlackRock has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, it cannot ensure that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to its businesses. BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies, procedures, culture and principles. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which could cause costly regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  The failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company’s reputation, the immigration policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals.  In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, if BlackRock’s share price were to decrease materially, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.  Risks Related to KEY THIRD-PARTY Relationships  The impairment or failure of third parties may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts BlackRock manages to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations.  22  Any such impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts managed by BlackRock, which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.    The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations; however, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, feasible alternative vendors available to BlackRock in certain areas. In addition, BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one vendor to another. For example, in January 2017 BlackRock announced it would be moving custody services on more than $1 trillion of client assets from State Street Corp. to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Any such transfer may be costly and complex, and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company, including with respect to certain of its products, which could result in reputational harm and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company’s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully, if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, such as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational harm to BlackRock.  Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock’s Exchange Traded Fund (“ETF”) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility. BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF’s most recent net asset value. The net asset value of an ETF is calculated at the end of each business day and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF’s holdings. The trading price of the ETF’s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. While an ETF’s creation/redemption feature and the arbitrage mechanism are designed to make it more likely that the ETF’s shares normally will trade at prices close to the ETF’s net asset value, exchange prices may deviate significantly from the ETF’s net asset value. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, inability or unwillingness of market markers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF’s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively, or significant market volatility. Although BlackRock and other large issuers of ETFs are working with market participants to enhance U.S. equity market resiliency, there can be no assurance that structural reforms will be implemented in a timely or effective fashion, or at all. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate significantly from an ETF’s net asset value, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Legal and Regulatory Risks  BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world.  BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. BlackRock may be adversely affected by its failure to comply with current laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject, see “Item 1 – Business – Regulation.”    Regulatory reforms in the United States expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty. In recent years a number of regulatory reforms have been introduced in the United States, including several that remain proposals or that are at various phases of implementation, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, or may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the United States, see “Item 1 – Business – Regulation,” key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:        •  Designation as a systemically important financial institution: The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) is considering potential systemic risk related to asset management. Its statements have generally indicated that it is, at this time, focused on a products and activities, rather than designation, approach in its review of asset managers. In the United States, the FSOC has not indicated whether or not it intends to designate any asset managers as SIFIs. In the event that BlackRock receives a SIFI  23          designation, under Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions and BlackRock could become subject to direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.        •  SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC has recently engaged in a period of active rule-making in an effort to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. In so doing, it has introduced rules that include (i) new monthly and annual reporting requirements for certain U.S. registered funds; (ii) enhanced reporting regimes for investments advisers; and (iii) the implementation of fund board approved liquidity risk management programs for ETFs and open-end funds, other than money market funds. The new rules will increase BlackRock’s public reporting and disclosure requirements, which could be costly and which may impede BlackRock’s growth and cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. The SEC has also proposed rules requiring all advisers to implement enhanced business continuity and transition plans, as well as more stringent asset segregation rules and leverage limits for U.S. registered funds, which may require funds holding derivatives to hold more cash, which, in turn could cause performance drag and increase tracking error.        •  The Volcker Rule: Provisions of Dodd-Frank referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the Bank Holding Company Act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve currently takes the position that PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock, which is approximately 22%, causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule. Conformance with the Volcker Rule may require BlackRock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds, and to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in those funds, which may occur at a discount to existing carrying value depending on market conditions.         •  Revised DoL Fiduciary Rule: In April 2016, the DoL published a new regulation defining the term "fiduciary" for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and the prohibited transaction exercise tax provisions of the IRS. The rule, which the DoL Memorandum has placed under review, is scheduled to begin to apply in April 2017. The rule would require BlackRock to revise a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and may limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain useful services and education to its clients.    Regulatory reforms in the United States could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be costly, impede the Company’s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock.   In addition, although it remains too early to accurately predict the forthcoming regulatory environment, a number of recent regulatory reforms, as well as proposals for future regulatory reform, may be repealed, modified or delayed, including those that are in the process of being implemented. Potential reform initiatives or regulatory changes, including those arising out of or in connection with the Executive Order or DoL Memorandum, that may directly or indirectly impact BlackRock’s business or operating activities include:        •  a repeal or modification of portions of Dodd-Frank, including the Volcker Rule;        •  a repeal, delay or revision to the DoL Fiduciary Rule;        •  changes to the regulatory landscape of public companies, financial institutions and trading, advisory and asset management firms;         •  changes to the process for designation of nonbank financial companies as SIFIs; and/or        •  the changing leadership at key financial regulatory agencies, including the SEC, OCC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Financial Stability Oversight Council.   International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty. BlackRock’s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the United States and the Company may be affected by a number of pending regulatory reform initiatives in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty, including:        •  British Exit from the European Union: In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as "Brexit", which resulted in significant volatility in several international markets. The timing and the outcome of the negotiations between the U.K. and the EU in connection with Brexit are highly uncertain and information regarding the long-term consequences of the vote is expected to become clearer over time. The Company will continue to monitor the potential impact of Brexit on its results of operations and financial condition.         •  Designation as a systemically important financial institution: The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) working with the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) is considering potential systemic risk related to asset management; statements made by these organizations have generally indicated that they are, at this time, focused on a products and activities, rather than designation, approach in their review of asset managers. This sentiment was most recently reiterated in the FSB’s final Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Asset Management Activities, released in January 2017, which continues to concentrate primarily on products and activities and includes 14 recommendations largely focused on liquidity in open-end funds, leverage in funds, operational risk, and securities lending, certain of which IOSCO is expected to engage on in the future. The FSB has indicated that it may develop criteria for designation of nonbank non-insurers in the future to address “residual risks”. Any measures applied in relation to a G-SIFI designation from the FSB would need to be implemented through existing regulatory processes and procedures by relevant national authorities.         •  Reform of EU investment markets: The European Commission has revised the Directive governing the provision of investment services in Europe (“MIFID”) and introduced an associated regulation (commonly referred to as MiFID II), which will be supplemented  24          by EU secondary legislation. The MiFID II reforms, which are scheduled to come into force in January 2018, are substantive, materially changing transparency requirements and enhancing protections afforded to investors. New disclosure and reporting obligations are being introduced, together with restrictions on how research may be funded and the nature of payments that may be provided to distributors. Market structure reforms will additionally force more derivatives to be traded on-exchange and introduce new commodity derivatives position limits. The broad nature of the MiFID II reforms may impact BlackRock’s distribution client servicing and distribution models, in particular affecting the fees BlackRock is able to charge to its clients and the commissions it is able to pay to its distribution partners. Market structure reforms may also impact the way that the Company executes investment decisions for client portfolios and have an impact on general market liquidity.        •  Revised EU capital requirements: EU regulators are considering how to design an appropriate capital regime for non-systemically important investment firms given that the current EU regime, which is based upon banking requirements, is not adapted for asset managers. The European Commission is currently expected to publish a number of proposals at the end of this year following consideration of a European Banking Authority final report on a suitable regulatory capital framework. Once implemented, any new requirements could result in significant changes to the regulatory capital that BlackRock is required to hold in the EU.        •  E.U. money market fund reform: The EU council has recently announced political agreement with the European Parliament on certain money market funds reforms that are intended to reduce perceived risks associated with these products. The reforms are expected to come into effect starting in 2018. Although technical details are still to be finalized, the reforms will limit the use of constant net asset value money market funds to those holding only government debt, and introduce a new category of “low volatility net asset value” money market funds, with both categories of money market funds being subject to reinforced liquidity requirements as well as safeguards such as liquidity fees and redemption gates. They may also reduce the attractiveness of certain money market funds to investors. BlackRock is evaluating the reforms and potential impact to its existing constant net asset value money market funds.        •  New disclosures to retail consumers: EU legislators have introduced a new “Key Information Document” (“KID”), which is applicable where a retail consumer is sold certain investment products. The KID must include specific information on costs, risks and performance. BlackRock will be required to produce a KID for each fund in scope, as well as to make information available to distribution partners who sell these funds in the EU.        •  Increased international regulatory scrutiny: BlackRock and its subsidiaries are subject to the authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies outside of the United States. These regulators have imposed numerous regulations, guidelines and standards on the activities of BlackRock and its subsidiaries covering a variety of areas, including capital resources requirements, marketing activities, client and investor protections, senior management arrangements, and system and control requirements. In the event that BlackRock or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with these often complex guidelines, regulations and standards, the regulators have broad powers to suspend or revoke any licenses they may have granted and/or to impose fines and/or sanctions.  Legal proceedings may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Financial Conduct Authority. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock’s shareholders, which could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages.  In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts.  As BlackRock’s business continues to grow, the Company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. In addition, the SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts. BlackRock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the Company fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, or penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock is subject to U.S. banking regulations that may limit its business activities.   As described in “Item 1-Business-Regulation”, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which may subject BlackRock to banking regulation as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC. The Bank Holding Company Act by its terms does not currently apply to BlackRock. The Federal Reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for the purpose of the Bank Holding Company Act and that BlackRock is subject to banking regulation. Based on this interpretation of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve could initiate a process to formally determine that PNC controls BlackRock under the terms of the Bank Holding Company Act. Any such determination, if successful, would subject BlackRock to current and future regulatory requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act, including the Volcker Rule, that are more restrictive than those the Company is subject to under other applicable laws, as well as the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve, which includes the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any effort by BlackRock to contest a control determination by the Federal Reserve may be costly and complex and may not result in a reversal of such determination. In addition, BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is organized as a national bank, is separately subject to banking regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). The OCC has broad supervisory and  25  enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank and also subjects it to capital requirements. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.  Failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Of note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  New tax legislation or changes to existing U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.    BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by U.S. or non-U.S. authorities. Similarly, the Company manages assets that have investment objectives which conform to specific tax law rules, which could be impacted by changes in tax law or policy, particularly with respect to investment income.   For example, Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) and the Common Reporting Standards (“CRS”) have introduced new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring persons with financial assets outside of their tax residence country pay appropriate taxes. FATCA and CRS impact both U.S. and non-U.S. funds and subject BlackRock to additional administrative burdens and reporting obligations. Certain EU Member States have also enacted financial transaction taxes (“FTTs”), which impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions. Several other EU Member States continue to discuss introducing FTTs. If introduced as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and on clients’ performance results. In addition, in October 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) released its final base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) package in an effort to curb the use of certain tax regimes and elements of tax planning, primarily in a cross-border context. The final package was endorsed by the G20 and is subject to implementation. As it stands, BEPS contains a number of provisions that would result in increased taxation for cross-border funds, particularly affecting fund raising for high alpha alternative products in Europe such as private debt and equity. In addition, in July 2016, the European Council formally adopted the Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (“EU Package”), which contains measures to regulate certain elements of tax planning further and to boost tax transparency. The BEPS package and the EU Package could curtail the amount of investments channeled by, and have unintended taxation consequences for, funds as well as the BlackRock’s overall tax position, which could adversely affect BlackRock’s financial condition and that of its clients.  The application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Risks Related to BlackRock’s SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER  PNC owns 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Future sales or distributions of BlackRock’s common stock in the public market by the Company or PNC could adversely affect the trading price of BlackRock’s common stock.  As of December 31, 2016, PNC owned 22% of the Company’s capital stock. Sales or distributions of a substantial number of shares of BlackRock’s common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales or distributions might occur, may cause the market price of BlackRock’s common stock to decline.  PNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC.  As discussed in BlackRock’s proxy statement, PNC has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board.  As discussed in BlackRock’s proxy statement, pursuant to BlackRock’s stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:         •  appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock;         •  any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than the persons holding such majority of the total voting power prior to the occurrence of any such merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock;         •  any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRock’s consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or  26          potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;         •  any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis;         •  except for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;         •  any amendment to BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or         •  any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.  Additionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC:         •  any sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenue of which, together with the annualized revenue of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenue of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;         •  for so long as BlackRock is a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the Bank Holding Company Act;           •  any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC;         •  any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or         •  a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.
