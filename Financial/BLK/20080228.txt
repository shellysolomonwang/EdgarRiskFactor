Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  As a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market and operating risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, however, by any of the following risks.  Risks Related to BlackRock’s Business and Competition  Changes in the securities or other markets could lead to a decline in revenues.  BlackRock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns earned on AUM. Movements in equity market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or all three could cause the following, which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees:        •    the value of AUM to decrease;        •    the returns realized on AUM to decrease;        •    clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive offer greater opportunity and that BlackRock does not serve;        •    clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that it does not manage; and        •    clients to rebalance assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees.  Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues.  The Company’s management believes that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks and to competitors could reduce revenues and growth because:        •    existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products, which could result in lower investment management fees;        •    the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish; or        •    the Company might earn minimal or no performance fees.  BlackRock may elect to invest in or provide other support to its products from time to time.  BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through seed or follow-on investments, warehouse lending facilities or other forms of capital or credit support. See, for example, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Other Operating Items” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Such investments or support utilize capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such investments or support, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products, could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings.  Changes in the securities or other markets could lead to a decline in the value of investments that BlackRock owns.  At December 31, 2007, BlackRock held approximately $2.0 billion of investments that are reflected on its statement of financial condition. Approximately $1.1 billion of this amount is the result of consolidation of certain sponsored investment funds. BlackRock’s economic interest in these investments is the result of seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. A decline in the prices of stocks or bonds or value of real estate or other alternative investments within or outside the United States could lower the value of these investments and result in a decline of non-operating income.    17      Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    Loss of key employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues.  The ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to BlackRock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining clients. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers and other professionals is competitive. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the difficulties in integrating the MLIM or Quellos Businesses. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel. Loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company.  BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.  Separate account clients may terminate their investment management contracts with BlackRock or withdraw funds on short notice. The Company has, from time to time, lost separate accounts and could, in the future, lose accounts or significant assets under management under various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance.  Additionally, BlackRock manages its U.S. mutual funds pursuant to management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually. A majority of the directors of each mutual fund are independent from BlackRock. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund that the Company manages will approve the fund’s management contract each year, or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the Company.  Further, the governing agreements of many of the Company’s private investment funds generally provide that, subject to certain conditions, investors in those funds, and in some cases independent directors of those funds, may remove the investment adviser, general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote, resulting in a reduction in the management or incentive fees as well as the total carried interest we would earn.  Failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or guidelines could result in damage awards against BlackRock and loss of revenues due to client terminations.  When clients retain BlackRock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf, they specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the Company is required to observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to BlackRock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their AUM or terminating their contracts, any of which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins.  The investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent that the Company is forced to compete on the basis of price, it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline.  Performance fees may increase earnings volatility, which could decrease BlackRock’s stock price.  A portion of the Company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments. In most cases, performance fees are based on investment returns, although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards. Generally, the Company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, performance fees for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. Performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition, causing earnings to be more volatile than if assets were not managed on a performance fee basis. The volatility in earnings may decrease BlackRock’s stock price. Performance fees represented $350.2 million, or 7.2%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007.    18      Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    Additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the Company’s competitive position.  BlackRock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins. These strategies have included smaller-sized lift-outs of investment teams and acquisitions of investment management businesses, such as the MLIM and Quellos Transactions. In general, these strategies may not be effective and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry. In the event BlackRock pursues additional sizeable acquisitions, it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from these acquisitions.  Risks Related to BlackRock’s Operations  Failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede the ability to support business growth.  BlackRock has experienced significant growth in its business activities as a result of the MLIM and Quellos Transactions and other efforts. The Company is in the process of building out its infrastructure to integrate the MLIM and Quellos Businesses and to support continued growth, including technological capacity, data centers, backup facilities and sufficient space for expanding staff levels. The failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with expansion could impede the Company’s growth, which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Expansion into international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, regulatory and other risks.  BlackRock has increased its international business activities as a result of the MLIM Transaction and other efforts. As a result of such expansion, the Company faces increased operational, regulatory, reputation and foreign exchange rate risks. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support such international expansion could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues.  A key element to BlackRock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage both in terms of operational efficiency and in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into BlackRock’s operating systems that support investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. Moreover, the Company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BlackRock Solutions clients. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes.    19      Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    Failure to implement effective information security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in BlackRock’s earnings or stock price.  BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack or a virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in the Company’s earnings or stock price.  The continuing integration of the MLIM and Quellos businesses creates numerous risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect profitability.  The MLIM and Quellos businesses and personnel are in the process of being integrated with BlackRock’s previously existing business and personnel. These transition activities are complex and the Company may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs including:        •    the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters;        •    difficulties in achieving expected synergies associated with the respective transactions;        •    difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;        •    difficulties in the assimilation of employees;        •    challenges in keeping existing clients and obtaining new clients, including potential conflicts of interest; and        •    challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.  As a result, the Company may not be able to realize the expected revenue growth and other benefits that it hopes to achieve from the respective transactions. In addition, BlackRock may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that would otherwise be spent on the development and expansion of its business and services.  Risks Related to Relationships with Merrill Lynch and PNC  Merrill Lynch is an important distributor of BlackRock’s products, and the Company is therefore subject to risks associated with the business of Merrill Lynch.  Under a global distribution agreement entered into with Merrill Lynch in connection with the MLIM Transaction, Merrill Lynch provides distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock asset management products and services through its various distribution channels. The Company may not be successful in distributing products through Merrill Lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third party distributors. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, BlackRock’s business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected.  Loss of market share with Merrill Lynch’s Global Private Client Group could harm operating results.  A significant portion of the revenue of the MLIM business has historically come from AUM generated by Merrill Lynch’s Global Private Client Group (“GPC”). BlackRock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship with GPC is material to the Company’s future performance. If one of the Company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the GPC retail channel at the expense of BlackRock, then BlackRock’s business, results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted.    20      Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    For so long as Merrill Lynch and PNC maintain certain levels of stock ownership, Merrill Lynch and PNC will vote as stockholders in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of Merrill Lynch and PNC.  As a result of the stockholder agreements entered into with PNC and Merrill Lynch in connection with the MLIM Transaction, together with the Company’s ownership structure, stockholders may have no effective power to influence corporate actions. As of December 31, 2007, Merrill Lynch owned approximately 45.1% of BlackRock’s issued and outstanding common stock and approximately 49.0% of total capital stock on a fully-diluted basis, and PNC owned approximately 33.5% of BlackRock’s total capital stock.  Merrill Lynch and PNC have agreed to vote all of their shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors to the extent consistent with the provisions of the Merrill Lynch stockholder agreement and the PNC implementation and stockholder agreement. As a consequence, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will be approved or disapproved solely in accordance with the determinations of the BlackRock Board of Directors, so long as the shares held by Merrill Lynch and PNC constitute a majority of the outstanding shares. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board.  Legal and Regulatory Risks  BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and internationally.  BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and around the world. See the discussion under the heading “Business – Regulation.” Violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities, reputational harm, suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser or broker-dealer registrations, or other sanctions, which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline. Additionally, BlackRock’s business may be adversely impacted by regulatory and legislative initiatives imposed by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory and exchange authorities, and industry participants that continue to review and, in many cases, adopt changes to their established rules and policies.  Failure to comply with the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and related regulations could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operations.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and BlackRock’s U.S. mutual funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed operational requirements, on investment advisers to registered investment companies. The failure of any of BlackRock’s subsidiaries to comply with the Advisers Act or the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts, including censure, termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to SEC-registered funds, and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the Company’s reputation, any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline.    21      Item 1A. RISK FACTORS (continued)    Failure to comply with ERISA regulations could result in penalties and cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit specified transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The failure of any of BlackRock’s subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the Company’s earnings or cause its stock price to decline.  BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.  Since PNC’s ownership interest in BlackRock exceeds 25%, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of PNC, a financial holding company, which subjects BlackRock to general banking regulations that limit the activities and the types of businesses in which it may engage. Banking regulations may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations. As a non-bank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock is subject to the supervision, regulation and examination of the FRB. The Company is also subject to the broad enforcement authority of the FRB, including the FRB’s power to prohibit BlackRock from engaging in any activity that, in the FRB’s opinion, constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the Company’s business. The FRB also may impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking regulations.  Legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results and financial condition for a particular period.  Many aspects of BlackRock’s business involve substantial risks of legal liability. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. While Merrill Lynch has agreed to indemnify the Company for certain of the pre-closing liabilities related to legal proceedings acquired in the MLIM Transaction, entities that BlackRock now owns may be named as defendants in these matters and the Company’s reputation may be negatively impacted. Liability for legal actions for which no indemnification is available could reduce earnings and cash flows and cause BlackRock’s stock price to decline. Additionally, the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.
