Item 1A — Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory Risks.”  Markets in Financial Instrument Directives  BlackRock is also subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives in Europe. For example, after the United Kingdom and other European jurisdictions in which BlackRock has a presence implemented the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) rules (described more particularly under “— European Regulation” below) into national legislation, these jurisdictions recently began the additional process of implementing MiFID 2 and a new Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. MiFID 2 builds upon many of the initiatives introduced through MiFID, which focused primarily on equities, to encourage trading across all asset classes to migrate on to open and transparent markets. MiFID 2, which will come into full effect in January 2017, will be implemented through a number of more detailed directives, regulations and technical standards to be made by the European Commission and by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”). It is expected that MiFID 2 will have significant and wide-ranging impacts on EU securities and derivatives markets. In particular, there will be (i) enhanced governance and investor protection standards, (ii) prescriptive rules on portfolio management firms’ ability to receive and pay for investment research relating to all asset classes, (iii) enhanced regulation of algorithmic trading, (iv) the movement of trading in certain shares and derivatives on to regulated execution venues, (v) the extension of pre- and post-trade transparency requirements to wider categories of financial instruments, (vi) restrictions on the use of so-called dark pool trading, (vii) the creation of a new type of trading venue called the     13    Table of Contents        Organized Trading Facility for non-equity financial instruments, (viii) commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements, (ix) a move away from vertical silos in execution, clearing and settlement, (x) an enhanced role for ESMA in supervising EU securities and derivatives markets and (xi) new requirements regarding non-EU investment firms’ access to EU financial markets. Implementation of these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on the Company and its subsidiaries and may require significant changes to client servicing models.  Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive  BlackRock’s European business is impacted by the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), which became effective on July 21, 2011. The AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) domiciled within and (depending on the precise circumstances) outside the EU. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The AIFMD is being implemented in stages, which run through 2018. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirements restrict alternative investment fund marketing and impose additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management on BlackRock. These new compliance and disclosure obligations and the associated risk management and reporting requirements will subject BlackRock to additional expenses.  Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities  The EU has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”) as regards depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions. The latest initiative in this area, UCITS V, which became effective in September 2014, seeks to align the depositary regime, remuneration rules and sanctioning powers of regulators under the UCITS Directive with the requirements of the AIFMD. UCITS V is required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state during the second quarter of 2016. Similarly, in August 2014 ESMA revised the guidelines it initially published in 2012 on ETFs and other UCITS funds. The guidelines introduced new collateral management requirements for UCITS funds concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives using Efficient Portfolio Management (“EPM”) techniques (including securities  lending) and over-the-counter derivative transactions. These rules, which are now in effect, required BlackRock to make a series of changes to its collateral management arrangements applicable to the EPM of its UCITS fund ranges. Compliance with the UCITS directives will cause BlackRock to incur additional expenses associated with new risk management and reporting requirements.  Extension of Retail Distribution Review  BlackRock must also comply with newly implemented retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. The rules were originally introduced in the United Kingdom and have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where BlackRock operates. Similarly, MiFID 2 will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other   nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules, if implemented, may lead to changes to the fees and commissions BlackRock is able to charge to its clients, as well as to its client servicing and distribution models.  EXISTING U.S. REGULATION - OVERVIEW  BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies.  The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.  BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States and globally. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on the Company’s activities and damage its reputation. Furthermore, the SEC has recently promulgated new rules that give effect to a section of the DFA that requires municipal advisors (as that term is defined in the statute) to register with the SEC. The new rules require entities that provide certain types of advice to, or on behalf of, or solicit municipal entities or certain other persons, to register with the SEC and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) as municipal advisors, thereby subjecting those entities to new or additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB. BlackRock has registered one of its subsidiaries, BTC, as a municipal advisor under these new rules.  BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the     14    Table of Contents        investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.  BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. Additional BlackRock entities may need to register as a CPO or commodity trading advisor as a result of recently enacted regulatory changes by the CFTC. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Two of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”) and BlackRock Execution Services, are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and a member of the MSRB, subject to MSRB rules.  U.S. Banking Regulation  PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”). As described in “Item 1-Business”, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Based on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby subjecting BlackRock to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to PNC, including the Volcker Rule. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries, its depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of PNC or BlackRock. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign laws and supervision that could affect its business.  BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory   requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. Based on the Federal Reserve’s position that BlackRock is a nonbank subsidiary of PNC, the Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations, and there are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock or its funds. PNC and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of BlackRock’s businesses. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries, including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal Reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s nonbank subsidiaries.  Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of PNC or one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed,” by any examination downgrade of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act.  One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC’s customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRock’s stockholders.  EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION — OVERVIEW  BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, they are also affected by U.S. laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.  Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.     15    Table of Contents       Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.  European Regulation  The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. It also regulates those U.K. subsidiaries’ branches established in other European countries and the U.K. branches of certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) regulates one BlackRock U.K. subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FCA’s rules adopted under that Act govern the majority of a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to the Company’s U.K.-regulated insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic based reviews in order to monitor the Company’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.  In addition, the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID, which became effective on November 1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the wider EEA. MiFID, the scope of which is being enhanced through MiFID 2 which is described more particularly under “— Global Regulatory Reform” above, sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock entities must also comply with the U.K.’s Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Mediation Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms (the Capital Requirements Directive), which became effective in January 2014. These include requirements not only on capital, but address matters of governance and remuneration as well. The obligations introduced through these directives will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations.  BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are additionally subject to an EU regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which was adopted in August 2012 and which requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts from February 2014.  Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region  In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law   Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activity which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Business Act.  In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.  The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”) which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.  BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector. Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices across the Asia Pacific region, including in Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors  As a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating and compliance risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below.  MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS  Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real estate, commodities, currency or other asset markets could cause assets under management (“AUM”), revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real estate, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests, could cause:        •   the value of AUM, or the returns BlackRock realizes on AUM, to decrease;        •   the withdrawal of funds from BlackRock’s products in favor of products offered by competitors;        •   the rebalancing of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees;        •   an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or        •   a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital.  The occurrence of any of these events may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.  BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from its investment advisory business. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock’s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of private investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds by simple majority vote with limited notice or penalty, or to remove BlackRock as the funds’ investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its U.S. mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds’ respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. If a number of BlackRock’s clients terminate their contracts, remove BlackRock from advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on favorable terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Increased competition may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  The investment management industry is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or future new business, could cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  The impairment or failure of other financial institutions may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages to many different industries and counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose the products and accounts BlackRock manages to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may otherwise fail to meet their obligations to BlackRock. Any such impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products or accounts managed by BlackRock, which could lead to the loss of clients and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock’s performance.  Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors’ products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance     17    Table of Contents        of such products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns could affect our nonoperating income and could increase the volatility of our earnings.  At December 31, 2014, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $1.3 billion in its investments (see “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments”) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real estate, commodities or alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings and may cause earnings to decline.  RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE  Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of:        •   client withdrawals in favor of better performing products;        •   the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients;        •   the Company earning minimal or no performance fees;        •   an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or        •   a decrease in investment returns on seed and co-investment capital.  Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings.  A portion of BlackRock’s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $550 million, or 5%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement pursuant to which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods, which could cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely impact product performance and client relationships.  BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment decisions and allocations, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading   and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on BlackRock’s business and reputation.  TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS  A failure in BlackRock’s operational systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover a significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations are concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London and Gurgaon. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock’s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock’s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic or other catastrophic event in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in disruption to the business or impede its growth. Notwithstanding BlackRock’s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company’s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which could cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or could impact the Company’s ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and sanctions.  Failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Failure to maintain Aladdin’s competitive position in a dynamic market for risk analytics could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.  The sophisticated risk analytics that BlackRock provides via the Aladdin technology platform to support investment advisory and BRS clients are a key element to BlackRock’s competitive success. BlackRock relies on its ability, as well as the ability of a number of third parties who provide it with various types of data and software, to maintain a robust and     18    Table of Contents        secure technological framework to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BRS clients. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to deliver a competitive product in a dynamic market for risk analytics or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes.  Operating risks associated with BlackRock’s securities lending program may result in client losses, and in certain circumstances, potential financial liabilities for the Company.  BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of the Company’s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from the risks of collateral investments). Additionally, in certain circumstances, the Company could potentially be held liable for the failure to manage any such risks.  BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default.  BlackRock indemnifies certain of its securities lending clients for specified losses that might occur upon the default of a borrower. These indemnities are designed to cover a client’s potential shortfall where the value of the collateral pledged by a defaulting borrower in connection with a securities lending agreement is less than the amount needed to repurchase the securities loaned to such a defaulting borrower. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2014 and subject to indemnification was $145.7 billion. BlackRock held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $155.8 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2014. Significant borrower defaults coupled with collateral shortfalls could result in material liabilities under these indemnities, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s decision to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or other credit support. Such support may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses on such support, as well as regulatory restrictions on our ability to provide such support or the failure to have available or devote sufficient capital or liquidity to support products, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock’s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth.  BlackRock’s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its ability to maintain and grow AUM, its creditworthiness and operating cash flows. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock’s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings as well as changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, could cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth.  Fraud, or the circumvention of controls and risk management policies, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Although BlackRock has adopted a comprehensive risk management process and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks, it cannot assure that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to its businesses. BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company’s controls, policies and procedures. Persistent or repeated attempts involving fraud, conflicts of interests or circumvention of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, which could cause costly regulatory inquiries and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to additional costs or operational risk.   BlackRock’s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services requires continued innovative efforts on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements. A failure to continue to innovate to introduce new products and services or to successfully manage the risks associated with such products and services may cause BlackRock’s costs to fluctuate, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.     19    Table of Contents       The failure to recruit and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock’s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company’s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers and other professionals is competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock’s ability to attract and retain such employees include the Company’s reputation, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals. In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to its employees is tied to the Company’s share price. As such, if BlackRock’s share price were to decrease materially, the retention value of such deferred compensation would decrease. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to attract and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company’s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted.  Future inorganic transactions may harm the Company’s competitive or financial position if they are not successful.  BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, access new clients and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, and acquiring investment management businesses and other small and medium-sized companies. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases the assumption of pre-existing liabilities. Any failure to identify and mitigate these risks through due diligence and indemnification provisions could adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation, may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, and may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry. Moreover, there can be no assurances that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from future inorganic transactions.  Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, regulatory and other risks.  As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company’s control. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  RISKS RELATED TO BLACKROCK’S KEY VENDOR AND DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS  The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business, which may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody, risk analytics, market data, market indices and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendor to fulfill its obligations could lead to operational and regulatory issues for the Company, including with respect to certain of its products, which could result in reputational harm and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. In particular, BlackRock entered into a global distribution agreement with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch in 2006, which is subject to renegotiation at the end of 2016. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors is material to the Company’s future performance. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully, if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline.  LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS  BlackRock is subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.  BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock’s business activities to a pervasive array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly, time-consuming and complex. BlackRock may be adversely affected by its failure to comply with current laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks, if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or business and may cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject, see “Item 1 – Business – Regulation.”  Regulatory reforms in the United States and internationally expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny.  In recent years a number of proposals for regulatory reform have been introduced and it is expected that the level of     20    Table of Contents        regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject will continue to increase. See “Item 1 – Business – Regulation.” A number of regulatory reforms that have been proposed may require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly and which may impede the Company’s growth and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock’s banking, insurance company and pension fund clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. Key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include:        •   Designation as a systemically important financial institution: Under the DFA, the Federal Reserve is charged with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for nonbank financial institutions which have been designated as “systemically important” by the FSOC. In addition, the FSB and IOSCO have issued a consultative document on proposed methodologies to identify nonbank/noninsurance G-SIFIs. Although BlackRock has not been designated as a SIFI or G-SIFI, if it is designated as such in the future, it is likely to become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements. Requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would need to be modified to be applicable to an asset manager such as BlackRock. No proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers.        •   The Volcker Rule: Provisions of the DFA referred to as the “Volcker Rule” created a new section of the BHC Act that places limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds (collectively “covered funds”). Complying with the Volcker Rule may reduce the level of market making and liquidity activities of several of BlackRock’s trading counterparties, which may adversely impact the liquidity and, in some cases, the pricing of various financial instruments in which BlackRock client accounts invest. Because the Federal Reserve currently treats BlackRock as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock may be required to conform its activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced a second extension to the Volcker Rule conformance period, giving banking entities until July 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds and foreign funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (“legacy covered funds”). The Federal Reserve also announced its intention to act in the future to grant banking entities an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with these legacy covered funds. The Volcker Rule’s restrictions would, among other things, limit BlackRock’s ability to invest in covered funds and require BlackRock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds. The Volcker Rule may also require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in covered funds, potentially at a discount to existing carrying value, depending on market conditions.      •   Money market mutual fund reform: Approximately 3% of BlackRock’s AUM as of December 31, 2014, consisted of assets in U.S. money market funds, of which institutional prime or institutional municipal money market funds (including offshore funds that feed into such money market funds) comprised approximately 2%. In July 2014, the SEC adopted rule amendments designed to reform the regulatory structure governing money market funds and to address the perceived systemic risks that such funds present. The new rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. The rules also provide for new tools for the funds’ boards designed to address liquidity shocks, including liquidity fees and redemption gates. The rules do not apply to government (non-municipal) and retail money market funds, except that retail money market funds must comply with liquidity fees and redemption gate requirements. The potential impact of the rules that affect the structure of the funds, which have a two-year compliance period, on BlackRock’s business remains untested; they may, however, reduce the attractiveness of certain money market funds to investors.        •   Regulation of swaps and derivatives: The implementation of DFA regulations, similar regulations in the EU and other global jurisdictions relating to swaps and derivatives could impact the manner in which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, increasing the costs of derivatives trading for BlackRock’s clients. Various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules will also introduce new central clearing requirements for certain swap transactions and will require that certain swaps be executed only on or through electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), with which BlackRock will have to comply. The new rules and regulations may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and will increase the operational and legal risks with which BlackRock will have to contend.        •   Increased international regulatory scrutiny: In addition to the extensive scrutiny BlackRock faces from U.S.-based regulators, the Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the authority of numerous governmental and regulatory bodies globally, in particular in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. These regulators have imposed numerous regulations, guidelines and standards on the activities of BlackRock and its subsidiaries covering a variety of areas, including capital resources requirements, marketing activities, client and investor protections, senior management arrangements and enhanced system and control requirements. In the event that BlackRock or any of its subsidiaries fails to comply with these often complex guidelines, regulations and standards, the regulators have broad powers to suspend or revoke any licenses they may have granted and/or to impose sanctions or fines.     21    Table of Contents           •   European Union Directives: In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission (“EC”) initiated a plan for EU financial reform, including a number of consultations and initiatives intended to improve retail investor protections, which the EC reflected in new or updated Directives and regulations. The resulting review of MiFID, introduction of AIFMD, the introduction of MiFID 2 and the revision of the UCITS Directive have increased the compliance, disclosure and other obligations BlackRock faces in the European Economic Area. Once fully implemented, these Directives will have significant and wide-ranging impacts on EU securities and derivatives markets, which will directly and indirectly impact BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries and other group companies.        •   Extension of Retail Distribution Review rules to new markets: BlackRock must also comply with newly implemented retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures and increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. The rules were originally introduced in the United Kingdom and have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where BlackRock operates. Similarly, MiFID 2 will contain a ban on certain advisers recovering commissions and other nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules, if implemented, may lead to changes to the fees and commissions BlackRock is able to charge to its clients, as well as to its client servicing and distribution models.  Legal proceedings could cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. Certain of BlackRock’s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, OCC, DOL, CFTC and FCA. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings, have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant regulator to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock’s funds, other BlackRock clients or by BlackRock’s shareholders, which could harm the Company’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable to the funds for damages.  In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts, any of which could cause the Company’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  As BlackRock’s business continues to grow, the Company must routinely address conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients or employees. In addition, the SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts. BlackRock has procedures and controls in place that are designed to detect and address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and if the Company fails, or appears to fail, to appropriately deal with any conflict of interest, it may face reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, or penalties or other sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.  As described in “Item 1-Business-Regulation”, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Based on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve currently takes the position that this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby subjecting BlackRock to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve. Such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that a nonbank subsidiary may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over nonbank subsidiaries, including the power to prohibit them from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. PNC is regulated as a “financial holding company” under the BHC Act, which allows PNC and BlackRock to engage in a much broader set of activities than would otherwise be permitted under the BHC Act; any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. In addition to being subject to capital requirements established by the OCC, BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary, which is organized as a national bank, is separately subject to banking regulation by the OCC. The OCC has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary. Being subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.  Failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  Of note among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to enhance its monitoring and reporting functions and improve the timeliness and accuracy of its disclosures. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past, and pose a risk that errors or omissions will occasionally occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties, which     22    Table of Contents        could, have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.  New tax legislation or changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws and regulations or challenges to BlackRock’s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition.  BlackRock’s businesses may be affected by new tax legislation or regulations, or the modification of existing tax laws and regulations, by U.S. or non-U.S. authorities. In particular, FATCA has introduced expansive new investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring U.S. persons with financial assets outside of the United States pay appropriate taxes. The FATCA rules will impact both U.S. and non-U.S. funds and subject BlackRock to extensive additional administrative burdens. Similarly, there has been renewed momentum by several EU Member States to introduce an FTT, which would impose taxation on a broad range of financial instrument and derivatives transactions. If introduced as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and on clients’ performance results. In addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development recently launched a base erosion and profit shifting proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions. If the BEPS proposal becomes the subject of legislative action in the format proposed it could have unintended taxation consequences for collective investment vehicles and the Company’s tax position, which could adversely affect BlackRock’s financial condition.  The Company also manages significant assets in products and accounts that have specific tax and after-tax related objectives, which could be adversely impacted by changes in tax policy, particularly with respect to U.S. municipal income, U.S. individual income tax rate on qualified dividends and, globally, alternative products. Additionally, any new legislation, modification or interpretation of tax laws could impact BlackRock’s corporate tax position. The application of complex tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and in the normal course of business, U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities may review and challenge BlackRock’s historical tax positions. These challenges may result in adjustments to BlackRock’s tax position, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition.  RISKS RELATED TO BLACKROCK’S SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER  PNC owns a large portion of BlackRock’s capital stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market by the Company or PNC could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2014, PNC owned 22% of the Company’s capital stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.  PNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC.  As discussed in our proxy statement, PNC has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement   with BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determination of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board.  As discussed in our proxy statement, pursuant to our stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:        •   appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock;        •   any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than those currently holding such majority of the total voting power, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock;        •   any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRock’s consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;        •   any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis;        •   except for repurchases otherwise permitted under the stockholder agreement, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;        •   any amendment to BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or        •   any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the NYSE.  Additionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC:        •   any sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenue of which, together with the annualized revenue of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenue of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;        •   for so long as BlackRock is a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the BHC Act;     23    Table of Contents           •   any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC;        •   any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or        •   a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.
