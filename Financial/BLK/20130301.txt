Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  As a leading investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock’s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market and operating risks, BlackRock’s business, financial condition, operating results or non-operating results could be materially adversely affected, or the Company’s stock price could decline as a result of any of the following risks.  Risks Related to BlackRock’s Business and Competition  Changes in the value levels of the capital, commodities or currency markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in revenues and earnings.  BlackRock’s investment management revenues are primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees expressed as a percentage of the returns earned on AUM. Movements in equity, debt, commodity, real estate or alternative investment market prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates could cause:        •    the value of AUM to decrease;        •    the returns realized on AUM to decrease;     20    Table of Contents      •    clients to withdraw funds in favor of products in markets that they perceive offer greater opportunity that BlackRock may not serve;        •    clients to rebalance assets away from products that BlackRock manages into products that it may not manage;        •    clients to rebalance assets away from products that earn higher fees into products with lower fees; and        •    an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.  The occurrence of any of these events could result in lower investment advisory, administration and performance fees or earnings and cause the Company’s stock price to decline.  Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues and earnings.  The Company’s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks or to competitors could reduce revenues and cause earnings to decline as a result of:        •    existing clients withdrawing funds in favor of better performing products, which could result in lower investment advisory and administration fees;        •    the diminishing ability to attract funds from existing and new clients;        •    the Company earning minimal or no performance fees; and        •    an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill.  The determination to provide support to particular products from time to time or provide securities lending indemnifications may reduce earnings or other investments in the business.  BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time support investment products through capital or credit support. Such support and indemnifications utilize capital that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. Losses or prohibitions on such support and indemnifications, or failure to have or devote sufficient capital to support products and securities lending, could have an adverse impact on revenues and earnings.  On behalf of certain clients, BlackRock lends securities to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide   and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock has issued certain indemnifications to certain securities lending clients against potential loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to fulfill its obligations should the value of the collateral pledged by the borrower at the time of default be insufficient to cover the borrower’s obligations under the securities lending agreement. These indemnifications cover only the collateral shortfall described above, and do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which securities lending cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2012 and subject to indemnification was $99.5 billion. BlackRock held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $104.8 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2012. BlackRock expects indemnified balances to increase over time.  While the collateral pledged by a borrower is intended to be sufficient to offset the borrower’s obligations to return securities borrowed in the event of a borrower default, BlackRock can give no assurance that the collateral pledged by the borrower will be sufficient to fulfill such obligations. If the amount of pledged collateral is not sufficient to fulfill obligations to a client for whom BlackRock has provided indemnification, BlackRock would be responsible for the amount of the shortfall, which could result in additional costs to BlackRock that cannot be estimated with certainty at this time.  Changes in the value levels of the capital markets or other asset classes could lead to a decline in the value of investments that BlackRock owns.  At December 31, 2012, BlackRock’s net economic investment exposure of approximately $1.2 billion in its investments (see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. A decline in the prices of equity or debt securities, or the value of real estate or other alternative investments within or outside the United States could lower the value of these investments and result in a decline of non-operating income and an increase in the volatility of BlackRock’s earnings.  Continued capital losses on investments could have adverse income tax consequences.  The Company may generate realized and unrealized capital losses on seed investments and co-investments.     21    Table of Contents   Realized capital losses may be carried back three years and carried forward five years and offset against realized capital gains for federal income tax purposes. The Company has unrealized capital losses for which a deferred tax asset has been established. In the event such unrealized losses are realized, the Company may not be able to offset such losses within the carryback or carryforward period or from future realized capital gains, in which case the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The failure to utilize the deferred tax asset could materially increase BlackRock’s income tax expense.  The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect BlackRock.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. BlackRock, and the products and accounts that it manages, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose BlackRock or the funds and accounts that it manages to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. While BlackRock regularly conducts assessments of such risk posed by its counterparties, the risk of non-performance by such parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets, including the effects of the European sovereign debt crisis and/or a collapse of the Eurozone financial system. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely impact BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.  The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to reduced AUM in similar products of BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRock’s products.  The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products of BlackRock without regard to the performance of BlackRock’s products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on the Company’s AUM, revenues and earnings.  Loss of employees could lead to the loss of clients and a decline in revenues.  The ability to attract and retain quality personnel has contributed significantly to BlackRock’s growth and success and is important to attracting and retaining   clients. The market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, financial advisers and other professionals is competitive. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain required personnel. Loss of personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  BlackRock’s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors.  Separate account and commingled trust clients may terminate their investment management contracts with BlackRock or withdraw funds on short notice. The Company has, from time to time, lost separate accounts and could, in the future, lose accounts or significant AUM due to various circumstances such as adverse market conditions or poor performance.  Additionally, BlackRock manages its U.S. mutual funds, closed-end and exchanged-traded funds under management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds’ boards of directors annually. A majority of the directors of each such fund are independent from BlackRock. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund managed by the Company will approve the fund’s management contract each year, or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to the Company.   Further, the governing agreements of many of the Company’s private investment funds generally provide that, subject to certain conditions, investors in those funds, and in some cases independent directors of those funds, may remove BlackRock as the investment adviser, general partner or the equivalent of the fund or liquidate the fund without cause by a simple majority vote, resulting in a reduction in the management or performance fees as well as the total carried interest BlackRock could earn.  Failure to comply with client contractual requirements and/or guidelines could result in damage awards against BlackRock and loss of revenues due to client terminations.  When clients retain BlackRock to manage assets or provide products or services on their behalf, they typically specify guidelines or contractual requirements that the Company is required to observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or contractual requirements could result in damage to BlackRock’s reputation or in its clients seeking to recover losses, withdrawing their AUM or terminating their contracts, any of which could cause the Company’s revenues and earnings to decline.     22    Table of Contents  Competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins.  The investment management industry, including the offering of exchange-traded funds, is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent that BlackRock is forced to compete on the basis of price, it may not be able to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could cause revenues and profit margins to decline.  Performance fees may increase revenue and earnings volatility.  A portion of the Company’s revenues is derived from performance fees on investment and risk management advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $463 million, or 5%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012. In most cases, performance fees are based on relative or absolute investment returns, although in some cases they are based on achieving specific service standards. Generally, the Company is entitled to performance fees only if the returns on the related portfolios exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, performance fees for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. Performance fees will vary from period to period in relation to volatility in investment returns and the timing of revenue recognition, causing earnings to be more volatile.  Additional acquisitions may decrease earnings and harm the Company’s competitive position.  BlackRock employs a variety of strategies intended to enhance earnings and expand product offerings in order to improve profit margins. These strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, acquisitions of investment management businesses, such as the MLIM, Quellos and BGI transactions and other small and medium-sized strategic acquisitions. These strategies may not be effective, and failure to successfully develop and implement these strategies may decrease earnings and harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry. In the event BlackRock pursues additional acquisitions, it may not be able to find suitable businesses to acquire at acceptable prices, and it may not be able to successfully integrate or realize the intended benefits from such acquisitions.  Risks Related to BlackRock’s Operations  Failure to maintain adequate infrastructure could impede BlackRock’s productivity and growth.  The Company’s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers, and office space, is vital to the   competitiveness of its business. The failure to maintain an adequate infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of its business, including any expansion, could impede the Company’s productivity and growth, which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline. Additionally, the overall stability of the euro could pose operational risks to the Company or the funds and accounts that it manages as a result of the adverse impacts that such issues may have on the Company’s trading, clearing, or counterparty relationships.  Failure to maintain adequate business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on BlackRock and its products.  A significant portion of BlackRock’s critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas, including San Francisco, California, New York, New York and London, England. A major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist or other catastrophic event could result in disruption to the business. The failure of the Company to maintain updated adequate business continuity plans, including secure backup facilities, systems and personnel could impede the Company’s ability to operate upon a disruption, which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Operating in international markets increases BlackRock’s operational, regulatory and other risks.  As a result of BlackRock’s extensive international business activities, the Company faces increased operational, regulatory, reputational and foreign exchange rate risks. The failure of the Company’s systems of internal control to properly mitigate such additional risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support such international activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions, which could cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Failure to maintain a technological advantage could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues.  A key element to BlackRock’s continued success is the ability to maintain a technological advantage in providing the sophisticated risk analytics incorporated into BlackRock’s Aladdin technology platform that support investment advisory and BRS clients. Moreover, the Company’s technological and software advantage is dependent on a number of third parties who provide various types of data and software. The failure of these third parties to provide such data or software could result in operational difficulties and adversely impact BlackRock’s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and BRS clients. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain this technological advantage or be able to effectively protect and enforce its intellectual property rights in these systems and processes.     23    Table of Contents  Failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses that could result in a decrease in BlackRock’s earnings or stock price.  BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of its information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, could cause a decline in the Company’s earnings or stock price.  The failure of a key vendor to BlackRock to fulfill its obligations could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock and its products.  BlackRock depends on a number of key vendors for various fund administration, accounting, custody and transfer agent roles and other operational needs. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key vendors to fulfill their obligations could lead to operational issues for the Company and in certain products, which could result in financial losses for the Company and its clients.  Failure to manage risks in operating BlackRock’s securities lending program for clients could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in revenues and liquidity.  The size of BlackRock’s securities lending programs increased significantly with the completion of the BGI Transaction. As part of these programs, BlackRock must manage risks associated with (i) ensuring that the value of the collateral held against the securities on loan does not decline in value or become illiquid and that its nature and value complies with regulatory requirements and investment requirements; (ii) the potential that a borrower defaults or does not return a loaned security on a timely basis; and (iii) errors in the settlement of securities, daily mark-to-market valuations and collateral collection. The failure of the Company’s controls to mitigate these risks could result in financial losses for the Company’s clients that participate in its securities lending programs as well as for the Company.  Risks Related to Relationships with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, PNC and Other Institutional Investors  Merrill Lynch is an important distributor of BlackRock’s products, and the Company is, therefore, subject to risks associated with the business of Merrill Lynch.  Under a global distribution agreement entered into with Merrill Lynch, Merrill Lynch provides distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through its various distribution channels. The Company may not be successful in distributing products through Merrill Lynch or in distributing its products and services through other third-party distributors. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it experiences an increase in distribution-related costs, BlackRock’s business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.  Loss of market share within Merrill Lynch’s Global Wealth & Investment Management business could harm operating results.  A significant portion of BlackRock’s revenue has historically come from AUM generated by Merrill Lynch’s Global Wealth & Investment Management (“GWIM”) business. BlackRock’s ability to maintain a strong relationship within GWIM is material to the Company’s future performance. If one of the Company’s competitors gains significant additional market share within the GWIM retail channel at the expense of BlackRock, then BlackRock’s business, results of operations or financial condition may be negatively impacted.  PNC has agreed to vote as a stockholder in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors, and certain actions will require special board approval or the prior approval of PNC and Merrill Lynch.  As discussed in our proxy statement, PNC has agreed to vote all of its voting shares in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock’s Board of Directors in accordance with the provisions of its stockholder agreement with BlackRock. As a consequence, if the shares held by PNC constitute a substantial portion of the outstanding voting shares, matters submitted to a stockholder vote that require a majority or a plurality of votes for approval, including elections of directors, will have a substantial number of shares voted in accordance with the determinations of the BlackRock Board of Directors. This arrangement has the effect of concentrating a significant block of voting control over BlackRock in its Board of Directors, whether or not stockholders agree with any particular determination of the Board. At December 31, 2012, PNC owned approximately 20.8% of BlackRock’s voting common stock.     24    Table of Contents  As discussed in our proxy statement, pursuant to our stockholder agreement with PNC, the following may not be done without prior approval of all of the independent directors, or at least two-thirds of the directors, then in office:        •    appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer of BlackRock;        •    any merger, issuance of shares or similar transaction in which beneficial ownership of a majority of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock would be held by persons different than those currently holding such majority of the total voting power, or any sale of all or substantially all assets of BlackRock;        •    any acquisition of any person or business which has a consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year that equals or exceeds 20% of BlackRock’s consolidated net income after taxes for its preceding fiscal year if such acquisition involves the current or potential issuance of BlackRock capital stock constituting more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock issued and outstanding immediately after completion of such acquisition;        •    any acquisition of any person or business constituting a line of business that is materially different from the lines of business BlackRock and its controlled affiliates are engaged in at that time if such acquisition involves consideration in excess of 10% of the total assets of BlackRock on a consolidated basis;        •    except for repurchases otherwise permitted under their respective stockholder agreements, any repurchase by BlackRock or any subsidiary of shares of BlackRock capital stock such that after giving effect to such repurchase BlackRock and its subsidiaries shall have repurchased more than 10% of the total voting power of BlackRock capital stock within the 12-month period ending on the date of such repurchase;        •    any amendment to BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws;        •    any matter requiring stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the NYSE; or        •    any amendment, modification or waiver of any restriction or prohibition on Merrill Lynch or its affiliates provided for under its stockholder agreements.  Additionally, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of PNC:        •    any sale of any subsidiary of BlackRock, the annualized revenues of which, together with the          annualized revenues of any other subsidiaries disposed of within the same year, are more than 20% of the annualized revenues of BlackRock for the preceding fiscal year on a consolidated basis;        •    for so long as BlackRock is a subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, entering into any business or activity that is prohibited for any such subsidiary under the BHC Act;        •    any amendment of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to PNC or materially more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to PNC;        •    any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of PNC or more favorable to the rights of any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be reasonably likely to cause PNC or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences; or        •    a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.  As discussed in our proxy statement, under BlackRock’s stockholder agreement with Merrill Lynch, which terminates on July 31, 2013, BlackRock may not enter into any of the following transactions without the prior approval of Merrill Lynch:        •    any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of a stockholder agreement between BlackRock and PNC or any stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to Merrill Lynch or materially more favorable to the rights of PNC or other stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock than to Merrill Lynch;        •    any amendment, modification, repeal or waiver of BlackRock’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws that would be viewed by a reasonable person as being adverse to the rights of Merrill Lynch or more favorable to the rights of PNC or other stockholder beneficially owning greater than 20% of BlackRock capital stock, or any settlement or consent in a regulatory enforcement matter that would be     25    Table of Contents          reasonably likely to cause Merrill Lynch or any of its affiliates to suffer regulatory disqualification, suspension of registration or license or other material adverse regulatory consequences;        •    any acquisition which would be reasonably likely to require Merrill Lynch to register with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company or become subject to regulation under the BHC Act, the Change of Bank Control Act of 1978 or Section 10 of the Homeowners Loan Act of 1934; or        •    a voluntary bankruptcy or similar filing by BlackRock.  Currently, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates own a de minimis number of shares of our capital stock.  PNC and several other institutional stockholders own a large portion of BlackRock’s capital stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market by the Company or its large stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  As of December 31, 2012, PNC owned 21.9% of the Company’s capital stock and several other institutional holders own in excess of 5% of BlackRock shares. The Company has entered into a registration rights agreement with PNC. The registration rights agreement, which includes customary “piggyback” registration provisions, may continue to allow PNC to cause us to file one or more registration statements for the resale of its shares of capital stock and cooperate in certain underwritten offerings. Sales by us or our large stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market pursuant to registration rights or otherwise, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.  Legal and Regulatory Risks  BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and internationally.  BlackRock’s business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and around the world. See the discussion under “Item 1 – Business – Regulation.” Violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, temporary or permanent prohibition of the engagement in certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of personnel or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser or broker-dealer registrations, or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition and cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  BlackRock may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes in the United States and internationally.  As previously mentioned, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “DFA”) was signed into law. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions in order to be implemented. The adoption of these regulations and decisions will in large measure determine the impact of the DFA on BlackRock. BlackRock is continuing to review the impact of the legislation and related rule-making will have on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  The business impact of the DFA and its regulations, and other new laws or regulations, including those affecting money market funds, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations in the United States or internationally, could adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, could require BlackRock to change certain business practices and could expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and tax costs).  The DFA charges the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) with establishing enhanced regulatory requirements for non-bank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”). Among the potential impacts of the DFA, if BlackRock were designated a systemically important financial institution (a “SIFI”), it could be subject to these enhanced prudential, supervisory and other requirements, which, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely impact BlackRock’s business and operations.  Provisions of the DFA referred to as the “Volcker Rule” place limitations on the ability of banks, and their subsidiaries and affiliates, to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of those funds (collectively “covered funds”). It is expected that the Volcker Rule will apply to BlackRock by virtue of BlackRock’s relationship to PNC, and BlackRock could become subject to similar limitations if it is designated a SIFI. The Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012; however, final implementing regulations have not yet been issued. Entities subject to the Volcker Rule will have until at least July 21, 2014 to come into compliance with the provisions of the Volcker Rule. To the extent the Volcker Rule applies to BlackRock, it would limit BlackRock’s ability to make and retain investments in covered funds, require BlackRock to remove its name from the name of its covered funds, and limit investments in covered funds by     26    Table of Contents   BlackRock employees, among other restrictions. Depending on the final implementation of the Volcker Rule and the granting of extensions, BlackRock could be required to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds, including at a discount, depending on market conditions. The scope of the definition of “covered funds” is not yet known, and therefore these restrictions could apply to funds other than those commonly referred to as hedge funds and private equity funds. These limitations and restrictions could disadvantage BlackRock against those competitors that are not subject to the Volcker Rule in the ability to attract clients into BlackRock covered funds and to retain employees.  Regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the FSOC and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, continue to focus on the need for additional regulations for money market mutual funds. In November 2012, the FSOC issued proposed recommendations for money market mutual fund reform for public comment, which closed on February 15, 2013. The FSOC recommendations included floating the net asset value of funds, requiring net asset value buffers and requiring that a portion of redemptions be held back by stable net asset value funds for a period of time, the retention of capital and liquidity gates and/or redemption fees. If adopted by the SEC, these proposals could significantly affect money market fund products and the entire money market fund industry. In light of the uncertainty regarding what changes may ultimately be adopted in a final SEC rule, we cannot predict what investor appetite will be for money market mutual fund products following the adoption of any such reforms or the impact of such reforms on BlackRock.  In 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States (the “OCC”) amended the regulations governing bank-maintained short-term investment funds (“STIFs”) to include new disclosure requirements regarding portfolio holdings and to more closely align portfolio limitations, such as maximum weighted average maturity and weighted average life, with those applicable to SEC registered money market funds. As a result of the new OCC rules, BlackRock chose to sell certain securities held within certain STIFs during the fourth quarter of 2012 and to make a one-time contribution to the STIFs to maintain the value of the funds while ensuring compliance with the OCC rules. As a result of the security sales, these STIFs are currently in compliance with the new OCC rules. The ultimate result of these rule changes is uncertain.  Further, regulations under the DFA relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives could impact the manner by which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, and could significantly increase the costs of derivatives trading conducted by   BlackRock on behalf of its clients. BlackRock will also need to build new compliance mechanisms to monitor compliance with SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) rules concerning, among other things, the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors (and the accompanying registration and regulation of such entities by the National Futures Association), the registration status of dealer counterparties and other counterparties who are major swap participants in the swap markets, and requirements concerning mandatory clearing of certain swap transactions. BlackRock, on behalf of its clients, is also preparing for mandated central clearing of swaps and mandated trading venue requirements.  In addition, BlackRock has begun reporting certain information about a number of its private funds to the SEC and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the CFTC, pursuant to systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies, which have required, and will continue to require, investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting.  The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service and the CFTC each continue to review the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds, which could result in regulations that further limit the use of futures and derivatives by mutual funds. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the CFTC, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.  In addition, in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations of which the review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) was a part. These, together with the changes contemplated by the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), will have direct and indirect effects on BlackRock’s operations in the European Economic Area, including increased compliance, disclosure and other obligations, which could impact BlackRock’s ability to expand in these markets.  The foregoing regulatory changes, and other reforms globally, could also lead to business disruptions, could adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested on behalf of clients and/or via seed or co-investments, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain business activities or distinguish itself from competitors. See “Item 1 – Business – Regulation” above for additional information regarding certain laws and regulations that affect BlackRock’s business.     27    Table of Contents  Failure to comply with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) and related regulations could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operations.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act and BlackRock’s U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations and fiduciary duties on registered investment advisers, including record-keeping, operating and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed operational and compliance requirements, on investment advisers to registered investment companies. The failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with the Advisers Act or the Investment Company Act could cause the SEC to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of either of these acts, including censure, termination of an investment adviser’s registration or prohibition to serve as adviser to SEC-registered funds, and could lead to litigation by investors in those funds or harm to the Company’s reputation, any of which could cause its earnings or stock price to decline.  Failure to comply with ERISA regulations could result in penalties and cause the Company’s earnings or stock price to decline.  Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) and to regulations promulgated thereunder, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit specified transactions involving ERISA plan clients and provide monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The failure of any of the relevant subsidiaries to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties that could reduce the Company’s earnings or cause its stock price to decline.  BlackRock is subject to banking regulations that may limit its business activities.  Because the total equity ownership interest of PNC in BlackRock exceeds certain thresholds, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of PNC, which is regulated as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As a non-bank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock is subject to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve.   Such banking regulation limits the activities and the types of businesses that BlackRock may conduct. The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice, and to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations. Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. In addition, BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary is subject to regulation by the OCC, and is subject to capital requirements established by the OCC. The OCC has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock’s trust bank subsidiary. Also, provisions of the DFA referred to as the Volcker Rule could, to the extent the final Volcker Rule is determined to apply to BlackRock’s activities, affect the method by which BlackRock invests in and operates its investment funds, including private equity funds, hedge funds and fund of funds platforms. Being subject to banking regulation, including potentially the Volcker Rule, may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because most of its competitors are not subject to these limitations.  Failure to comply with laws and regulations in the United Kingdom, other member states of the European Union, Hong Kong, Japan, Australia and other non-U.S. jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operations.  The FSA regulates BlackRock’s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services-related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSA’s rules made under that Act govern a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries.  In addition, these subsidiaries, and other European subsidiaries, branches or representative offices, must comply with the pan-European regime established by MiFID, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. As discussed under “Item 1 - Business - Regulation,” in the aftermath of the financial crisis the European Commission set out a detailed plan to complete the EU’s financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations. The AIFMD, which became effective on July 21, 2011, is required to be     28    Table of Contents   implemented by EU member states by July 22, 2013. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirements may restrict alternative investment funds marketing and place additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management. UCITS IV was required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by July 1, 2011. UCITS IV was adopted into national law by the United Kingdom prior to the deadline but several other EU member states are still in various stages of the adoption process. There are also European Commission consultations in process that are intended to improve retail investor protection including UCITS V, which addresses, among other items, custodial liability. Recent proposals on packaged retail investment products (“PRIPs”) are to be implemented through the strengthening of MiFID standards (for non-insurance PRIPs), revisions to the Insurance Mediation Directive’s selling standard (for all insurance-based PRIPs) and new investor disclosure requirements for all PRIPs through a separate EU legislative process. In the United Kingdom, the Bribery Act 2010 came into force in July 2011 and has required the implementation of additional procedures on the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. In addition, a retail distribution review initiated by the FSA is expected to change how investment advice is paid for in the United Kingdom for all investment products. Final retail distribution rules were published in 2011, with implementation at the end of 2012. In a similar area, a further European Commission Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”), was adopted in August 2012, and requires the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives and the mandatory reporting of all derivative contracts. Some of the EMIR technical standards have recently been finalized and the remainder are expected to be finalized in 2013.  In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.  In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. ASIC regulates   companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the relevant subsidiaries’ licenses in Australia.  The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.  There are similar legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business or where the funds and products it manages are organized. Failure to comply with laws and regulations in any of these jurisdictions could result in substantial harm to BlackRock’s reputation and results of operation.  Legal proceedings could adversely affect operating results, financial condition and cash flows for a particular period.  Many aspects of BlackRock’s business involve substantial risks of legal liability. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock’s activities. From time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations or proceedings. Additionally, certain of the investment funds that the Company manages are subject to lawsuits, any of which could potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the Company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages.
