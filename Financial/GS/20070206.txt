Item 1A. Risk Factors   We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal and regulatory risks. The following are some of the more important factors that could affect our businesses.           Our businesses may be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally.    Our business, by its nature, does not produce predictable earnings. While we have achieved record earnings per common share in each of our last three fiscal years, reflecting a favorable trading and investing environment and an increase in investment banking activity, an adverse change in these market conditions may adversely affect our results of operations.   Our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally, and these conditions may change suddenly and dramatically. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, stable geopolitical conditions, transparent and efficient capital markets, low    20    Table of Contents   inflation, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions, which can be caused by outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical instability, declines in business confidence, increases in inflation, corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets, natural disasters or pandemics or a combination of these or other factors, have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our business and profitability in many ways, including the following:            •   We have been operating in a low interest rate market for the past several years. Increasing or high interest rates and/or widening credit spreads, especially if such changes are rapid, may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses.         •   We have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of our businesses and generally maintain large trading, specialist and investing positions. Market fluctuations and volatility may adversely affect the value of those positions, including, but not limited to, our interest rate and credit products, currency, commodity and equity positions, and our merchant banking investments, or may reduce our willingness to enter into new transactions. From time to time, we have incurred significant trading losses in periods of market turbulence. Conversely, certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses.         •   Industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our revenues and, because we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly, our profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues are derived from our participation in large transactions, a decrease in the number of large transactions due to uncertain or unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our investment banking business.         •   Pricing and other competitive pressures have continued, even as the volume and number of investment banking transactions have increased. In addition, the trend in the underwriting business toward multiple book runners and co-managers handling transactions, where previously there would have been a single book runner, has adversely affected our business and reduced our revenues.         •   Reductions in the level of the equity markets or increases in interest rates tend to reduce the value of our clients’ portfolios, which in turn may reduce the fees we earn for managing assets. Increases in interest rates or attractive conditions in other investments could cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds or other products. Even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market conditions, investment performance by our asset management business below the performance of benchmarks or competitors could result in a decline in assets under management and in the incentive and management fees we receive as well as reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors.         •   Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, proprietary trading and investing, block trading, merchant banking, underwriting and lending businesses. This risk may increase to the extent we expand our proprietary trading and investing businesses or commit capital to facilitate customer-driven business. For example, in recent years large blocks of securities have increasingly been sold in block trades rather than on a marketed basis, which increases the risk that Goldman Sachs may be unable to resell the purchased securities at favorable prices and may incur significant losses as a result. Moreover, because of concentration of risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry. We also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses. The number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period.     21    Table of Contents            •   The volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and as a specialist or market maker may decline, which would reduce the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. In addition, competitive pressures and other industry factors, including the increasing use by our clients of low-cost electronic trading, could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. In our specialist businesses, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing shares in a declining market. This may result in trading losses and an increased need for liquidity. Weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. In addition, competitive pressures have been particularly intense in the context of block trades.         •   The emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency, or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency, could create economic and financial disruptions in emerging markets and other areas throughout the world, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses around the world. In addition, unforeseen or catastrophic events, including health emergencies, terrorist attacks or natural disasters, could expose our insurance subsidiaries to significant losses.            We may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.    We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems. Our trading risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, we may, in the course of our activities, incur losses.   The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators, and in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. In the past, these types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future.   Market volatility has been relatively low in recent years. An increase in volatility would increase our measured risk, which might cause us to reduce our proprietary positions or to reduce certain of our business activities. In such circumstances, we may not be able to reduce our positions or our exposure in a timely, cost-effective way or in a manner sufficient to offset the increase in measured risk.   For a further discussion of our risk management policies and procedures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.           Our liquidity and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets, by a reduction in our credit ratings or by an inability of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. to access funds from its subsidiaries.    Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to sell assets or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. The financial    22    Table of Contents   instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are increasingly complex, as we employ structured products to benefit our clients and ourselves, and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Growth of our proprietary investing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our positions. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time.   Our credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with Goldman Sachs or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements.   The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. needs to make payments on obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend payments.           Our businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by a deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets.    We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. A significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results. The amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years, as has the breadth of the entities to which we have credit exposures. As a clearing member firm, we finance our client positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. In addition, we have experienced, due to competitive factors, pressure to extend and price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take. In particular, corporate clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with investment banking and other assignments. While our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment funds and other institutional clients, resulting in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry. In the ordinary course of business, we may also be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower or issuer.   Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect Goldman Sachs.    23    Table of Contents           We face enhanced risks as new business initiatives lead us to transact with a broader array of clients, with new asset classes and in new markets.    A number of our recent and planned business initiatives and expansions of existing businesses may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client base and with new asset classes and new markets. For example, we have begun providing loans to small and mid-sized businesses, increased our exposure to subprime mortgages and are transacting business and investing in new emerging markets. In addition, we are increasingly offering complex structured products and alternative investments to a wider investor base, both directly and through third-party distribution channels. Furthermore, a number of our businesses, including our proprietary investing and merchant banking activities, cause us to directly or indirectly own interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership and operation of, public services, such as airports, toll roads, shipping ports and electric power generation facilities, both within and outside the United States. These business activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, including reputational concerns arising from dealing with less sophisticated counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in which these assets are being operated or held.           Derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses.    We are party to a large number of derivative transactions, including credit derivatives, that require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may have difficulty obtaining, or be unable to obtain, the underlying security, loan or other obligation through the physical settlement of other transactions. As a result, we are subject to the risk that we may not be able to obtain the security, loan or other obligation within the required contractual time frame for delivery. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as increased costs to the firm.   Derivative contracts and other transactions entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties on a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce the contract.           A failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses.    Shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems could lead to impairment of our liquidity, financial loss, disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.   We also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions, and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we will increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients’ systems. In recent years, there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses, which has increased our    24    Table of Contents   exposure to operational failure or termination of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in the event of any such failure or termination. Any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients and manage our exposure to risk.   Despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by Goldman Sachs or third parties with which we conduct business. These disruptions may occur, for example, as a result of events that affect only the buildings of Goldman Sachs or such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings are located. Nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including New York, London, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Bangalore, work in close proximity to one another, in one or more buildings. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.   Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients’, our counterparties’ or third parties’ operations, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.   We routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We have discussed and worked with clients and counterparties to develop secure transmission capabilities, but we do not have in place secure capabilities for all of our clients and counterparties. An interception or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client or counterparty could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. We are exposed to similar risks arising from the interception of personal, confidential or proprietary information sent to or received from, or the misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information by, vendors, service providers and other third parties who may receive such information from us, and our efforts to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place may not be successful.           Conflicts of interest are increasing and a failure to appropriately deal with conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.    Our reputation is one of our most important assets. As we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we increasingly have to address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own proprietary investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of another client, as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material non-public information that may not be shared with other businesses within the firm.   The SEC, the NASD, other federal and state regulators and regulators outside the United States, including in the United Kingdom and Japan, have announced their intention to increase their    25    Table of Contents   scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest, including through detailed examinations of specific transactions. There have been recent public reports that the Department of Justice is conducting an investigation regarding joint participation by certain private equity firms and other financial institutions in certain leveraged buyouts, referred to as “club deals.” In addition, certain complaints filed against firms other than Goldman Sachs allege the violation of antitrust laws arising from their “club deal” arrangements. A number of class action complaints have also been filed in connection with certain specific “club deal” transactions which name the relevant “club deal” participants among the defendants, including Goldman Sachs affiliates in several cases, and generally allege that the transactions constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by the target company and that the “club” participants aided and abetted such breach. We may become subject to further litigation or regulatory scrutiny in the future in this regard.   We have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to address conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions.           Our businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.    Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the financial services industry, is subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. Among other things, we could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on our business activities.   New laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients may also adversely affect our businesses. Regulatory changes could lead to business disruptions, could require us to change certain of our business practices and could expose us to additional costs and liabilities as well as reputational harm. For a discussion of the extensive regulation to which our businesses are subject, see “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment. The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, both within and outside the United States. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years, and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions. For example, regulators, both within and outside the United States, continue to scrutinize complex, structured finance transactions and have brought enforcement actions against a number of financial institutions in connection with such transactions. We seek to create innovative solutions to address our clients’ needs, and we have entered into, and continue to enter into, structured transactions with clients.   This environment has led some of our clients to be less willing to engage in transactions that may carry a risk of increased scrutiny by regulators and has created uncertainty with respect to a number of transactions that had historically been entered into by financial services firms, including our firm, and that were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate. This environment also has led us and our competitors to modify transaction structures and, in some cases, to limit or cease our execution of some types of transactions. While we have policies and procedures in place that are intended to ensure that the transactions we enter into are appropriately reviewed and comply with applicable laws and regulations, it is possible that certain transactions could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions or that the regulatory scrutiny of, and litigation in connection with, transactions    26    Table of Contents   will make our clients less willing to enter into these transactions with us, and will adversely affect our business.           Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Goldman Sachs could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Goldman Sachs, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.    We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. See “Legal Proceedings” in Part I, Item 3 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved.   For example, federal and state authorities and other regulatory entities, including the NASD, have made informational requests regarding market timing, late trading and other activities broadly across all of the major fund companies and broker-dealers, including Goldman Sachs. While we believe that we have in place reasonable measures to detect and deter disruptive and abusive trading practices and comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, we cannot predict the course that these inquiries and areas of focus may take or the impact that any new laws or regulations governing mutual funds may have on our businesses.   Also, in March 2004, certain NYSE specialist firms, including our specialist unit, agreed to a settlement with the SEC and NYSE to resolve charges that the firms violated certain federal securities laws and NYSE rules in connection with their activities as NYSE specialists during the years 1999 through 2003. The settlement did not resolve the related civil actions discussed under “Legal Proceedings — Specialist Matters” in Part I, Item 3 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, or potential regulatory charges against individuals. In addition, we have received requests for information from regional stock exchanges and options exchanges regarding specialist activities. As a result of the settlement and any related developments, other investigations or any new laws or regulations governing specialists, our specialist businesses may be adversely affected and the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets related to these businesses may be impaired.   There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.           The financial services industry is highly competitive.    The financial services industry — and all of our businesses — are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation and price. We believe that we will continue to experience pricing pressures in the future as some of our competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices. Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. U.S. federal legislation, which significantly expanded the activities permissible for firms affiliated with a U.S. bank, has accelerated this consolidation and further increased competition. This trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. As our business expands into new business areas and new geographical regions, we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to expand.    27    Table of Contents           The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technology may adversely affect our business and may increase competition.    Technology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading systems compete with our trading businesses, including our specialist businesses, and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased use by our clients of low-cost electronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. The NYSE’s adoption of its hybrid market for trading securities may increase pressure on our Equities business as customers execute more of their NYSE-related trades electronically. We have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return on our investment, particularly given the relatively lower commissions arising from electronic trades.           Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.    Competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry, such as hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds, for qualified employees is intense, particularly in emerging markets. Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals; therefore, our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses and to expand into new business areas depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. In addition, current and future laws (including laws relating to immigration and outsourcing) may restrict our ability to move responsibilities or personnel from one jurisdiction to another. This may impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or potential efficiencies.           Our power generation interests subject us to the risks associated with owning power generation facilities.    The operation of our power generation facilities may be disrupted for many reasons, many of which are outside our control, including the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. In addition, these facilities could be adversely affected by the failure of any of third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations, including the failure to obtain raw materials necessary for operation at reasonable prices. Market conditions or other factors could cause a failure to satisfy or obtain waivers under agreements with third parties, including lenders and utilities, which impose significant obligations on our subsidiaries that own such facilities. The occurrence of any of such events may prevent the affected facilities from performing under applicable power sales agreements, may impair their operations or financial results and may result in litigation or other reputational harm.   Our power generation facilities are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources, site remediation and health and safety. In the past several years, intensified scrutiny of the energy market by federal, state and local authorities and the public has resulted in increased regulatory and legal proceedings involving companies engaged in electric power generation. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to power generation, including having to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control equipment, payment of emission fees, and application for,    28    Table of Contents   and holding of, permits and licenses at our power generation facilities. In certain instances, compliance with applicable laws and regulations may require us to cease or curtail operations of one or more of our power generation facilities. Our power generation facilities are also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events. We may not have insurance against these risks or other risks, including environmental risks, that such facilities face, and, in cases in which we do have insurance, the insurance proceeds may be inadequate to cover our losses. Our overall businesses and reputation may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory proceedings, particularly those related to the environmental matters, arising out of our power generation business, as well as by the occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events.           In conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, economic, legal, operational and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.    In conducting our businesses and maintaining and supporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.   Our businesses and operations are increasingly involved in emerging markets throughout the world, and we expect this trend to continue. In the last several years, various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally.             Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments
