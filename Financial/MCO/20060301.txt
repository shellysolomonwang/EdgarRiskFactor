ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets  Approximately 80% of Moody’s revenue in 2005 was derived from ratings, a significant portion of which was related to the issuance of credit-sensitive securities in the global capital markets. Moody’s revenue growth from these sources in 2005 was in line with its compound annual growth rate from 2001 through 2004 as continued strength in global structured finance, strong financial institutions issuance and ratings of bank credit facilities was partially offset by the impacts of declines in U.S. high yield issues and in investment grade corporate finance issuance volumes in the U.S. and Europe. The Company anticipates that a substantial part of its business will continue to be dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Therefore, the Company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the level of debt issuance.  Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Moody’s provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could also have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business and financial results.  Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue Through Competition or Regulation  The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. Moody’s competes on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, client service, research, reputation, regulatory qualification, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation. For example, a large investment grade default could impact the Company’s reputation and potentially lead to greater regulatory oversight. Moody’s faces increasing competition from S&P, Fitch, DBRS, local rating agencies in a number of jurisdictions and niche companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company, Inc., with respect to the insurance industry). Since Moody’s believes that some of its most significant challenges and opportunities will arise outside the U.S., it will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that Moody’s does not receive.  Currently, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch, DBRS and A.M. Best Company, Inc. are designated as NRSROs by the SEC. In March 2005, the SEC disclosed that in considering the oversight of NRSROs, it may pursue a voluntary compliance and oversight framework for rating agencies that are designated as NRSROs, or it could seek legislative authority for formal compliance and oversight for NRSROs.  In April 2005, the SEC released for public comment a Proposed Rule on the “Definition of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization”. The proposed definition of the term NRSRO is an entity that: (i) issues publicly available credit ratings that are current assessments of the creditworthiness of obligors with respect to specific securities or money market instruments; (ii) is generally accepted in the financial markets as an issuer of credible and reliable ratings, including ratings for a particular industry or geographic segment, by the predominant users of securities ratings; and (iii) uses systematic procedures designed to ensure credible and     13     reliable ratings, manage potential conflicts of interest, and prevent the misuse of nonpublic information, and has sufficient financial resources to ensure compliance with those procedures. Numerous market participants, including Moody’s, responded to the request for comment. Moody’s response can be found on the Regulatory Affairs page of the Company’s website.  In addition, in June 2005 the SEC produced technical assistance pursuant to a congressional request, relating to statutory authority that the SEC may need if Congress determines that it is appropriate to create a comprehensive oversight regime for credit rating agencies. Congress had also requested that market participants provide their views on the SEC’s technical assistance. Moody’s comments can be found on the Regulatory Affairs page of the Company’s website.  At present, Moody’s is unable to assess the likelihood of any regulatory changes that may result from the SEC’s ongoing review. However, the elimination of the NRSRO concept, retention of the NRSRO concept with different regulatory oversight, or SEC recognition of additional NRSROs could result in loss of market share or revenue for Moody’s, or higher costs of operations.  Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies  The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are increasingly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody’s.  Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers  In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. While Moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moody’s may lose market share.  Possible Loss of Key Employees to Investment or Commercial Banks or Elsewhere and Related Compensation Cost Pressures  Moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives. Investment banks and other competitors for analyst talent may be able to offer higher compensation than Moody’s. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moody’s ability to compete effectively will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees.  Exposure to Litigation Related to Moody’s Rating Opinions  Moody’s faces litigation from time to time from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions. In addition, as Moody’s international business expands, these types of claims may increase because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as is provided by the First Amendment). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time.    14    Potential Emergence of Government-Sponsored Credit Rating Agencies  When governments adopt regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, the competitive balance among rating agencies and the level of demand for ratings may be positively or negatively affected. Government-mandated ratings criteria may also have the effect of displacing objective assessments of creditworthiness. In these circumstances, debt issuers may be less likely to base their choice of rating agencies on criteria such as independence and credibility, and more likely to base their choice on their assumption as to which credit rating agency might provide a higher rating, which may negatively affect the Company.  Potential for New U.S., Foreign, State and Local Legislation and Regulations, Including Those Relating to Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations  In the United States and other countries, the laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and are presently subject to review by a number of legislative or regulatory bodies, including the SEC in the United States and the CESR on behalf of the European Union. It is possible that such reviews could lead to greater oversight or regulation concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Such additional regulations could, potentially, increase the costs associated with the operation of a credit rating agency, alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process, increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings, change the regulatory framework to which credit rating agencies are subject and/or affect the competitive environment in which credit rating agencies operate. A description of certain of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the United States and other countries is described above under the section entitled “Regulation” in Item 1, “Business”, of this Form 10-K. At present, Moody’s is unable to predict the regulatory changes that may result from ongoing reviews by the SEC or other regulatory bodies or the effect that any such changes may have on its business.  Exposure to Increased Risk from Multinational Operations  Moody’s maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. operations in different countries expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as:        •   changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting either Moody’s operations or its customers’ use of ratings        •   possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions        •   restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars        •   currency fluctuations        •   export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers        •   difficulty in staffing and managing offices as a result of, among other things, distance, travel, cultural differences and intense competition for trained personnel        •   longer payment cycles and problems in collecting receivables        •   political and economic instability        •   potentially adverse tax consequences  Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company in the future.    15    ITEM 1B.
