ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company’s management currently deems minor or insignificant also may impair its business operations. If any of the following risks occur, Moody’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets  Approximately 49% of MIS’ revenue for 2008 was transaction-based, compared to 68% of MIS’ revenue in 2007. Revenue from rating transactions, in turn, is dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Accordingly, any conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which Moody’s provides ratings services, and thereby, have an adverse effect on the fees derived from the issuance of ratings.  A significant disruption in world financial markets, particularly in the credit markets, that began in mid-2007 worsened materially in the second half of 2008, particularly in the latter portion of the year when many credit markets experienced a severe lack of liquidity. These credit market disruptions together with the current economic slowdown have negatively impacted the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings. Consequently, the Company has experienced a substantial reduction in the demand for rating newly issued debt securities resulting in a 32% decrease in MIS revenue for 2008 compared to 2007. The timing and nature of any recovery in the credit and other financial markets remains uncertain, and there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the future or that financial results will not continue to be adversely affected. A sustained period of market decline or weakness, especially if it relates to credit sensitive securities, for which there is typically a high level of demand for ratings, could have a material adverse effect on Moody’s business and financial results. Initiatives that the Company has undertaken to reduce costs may not be sufficient to offset the results of a prolonged or more severe downturn, and further cost reductions may be difficult or impossible to obtain in the near term, due in part to rent, technology and other fixed costs associated with some of the Company’s operations as well as the need to monitor outstanding ratings. Further, the cost-reduction initiatives undertaken to date could result in strains in the Company’s operations if the credit markets and demand for ratings return to levels that prevailed prior to mid-2007 or otherwise unexpectedly surge.  Other factors that could further reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities include increases in interest rates or credit spreads, continued volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant regulatory, political or economic events, the use of alternative sources of credit including financial institutions and government sources, defaults of significant issuers and other unfavorable market and economic conditions.  Regulation as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization and Potential for New Domestic and Overseas Legislation and Regulations  Credit rating agencies are regulated in both the U.S. and in other countries (including by state and local authorities). Currently, Moody’s is designated as an NRSRO pursuant to SEC regulation enacted in response to the adoption of the Reform Act. One of the central promises of the Reform Act was to encourage competition among rating agencies. Given its adoption, Moody’s is unable to assess the future impact of any regulatory changes that may result from the SEC’s regulations or the impact on Moody’s competitive position or its current practices. Possible consequences of these new regulations include issues that may affect all entities engaged in the rating agency business, such as expected increased costs, or issues that may affect Moody’s in a disproportionate manner. Any of these changes could negatively impact Moody’s operations or profitability, the Company’s ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services in ways that Moody’s presently is unable to predict.  In addition, over the past year, both the G-7 and the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors have sought to analyze and arrive at a consistent approach for addressing the various areas of the financial market and have made a variety of recommendations as to regulation of rating agencies and the markets for ratings. Finance ministers have also agreed to register rating agencies in their home jurisdiction. As a result, of the internationally coordinated activity, individual countries likely will begin implementing registration regimes for the oversight of CRAs in the coming years. In particular, the European Commission presently is re-examining the regulatory framework for rating agencies in Europe. In November 2008, the           18   MOODY’S 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS    Table of Contents    Commission published a draft regulation for the oversight of regulating rating agencies that operate in the EU. It is as yet too early to assess the form and content of this re-evaluation. As with the recent regulatory initiatives in the U.S., these initiatives may affect all entities engaged in the rating agency business or may affect Moody’s in a disproportionate manner, and could negatively impact Moody’s operations or profitability, the Company’s ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services in ways that Moody’s presently is unable to predict.  In addition to the foregoing, many legislative and regulatory agencies, both in the U.S. and in other countries, have been studying or pursuing new laws and regulations addressing CRAs and the use of credit ratings. It is possible that such initiatives could lead to additional laws or regulations affecting Moody’s operations or profitability, the Company’s ability to compete, or the markets for its products and services. This could include adopting regulations that require debt securities to be rated, establish criteria for credit ratings or authorize only certain entities to provide credit ratings, which could negatively affect competition among rating agencies, the level of demand for ratings or the Company’s ability to provide objective assessments of creditworthiness. Additional regulations could, potentially, increase the costs associated with the operation of a CRA, alter the rating agencies’ communications with the issuers as part of the rating assignment process, increase the legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings, change the regulatory framework to which CRAs are subject and affect the competitive environment in which CRAs operate.  As existing laws and regulations applicable to credit ratings and rating agencies continue to evolve and new laws or regulations are adopted, the costs of compliance may increase and Moody’s may not be able to pass these costs through the pricing of its products. In addition, increased regulatory uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of laws and regulations may increase costs, decrease demand or affect the manner in which Moody’s or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, or alter the economics of the credit ratings business by restricting or mandating the business models under which an NRSRO is permitted to operate.  A description of several of the more recent regulatory initiatives in the U.S. and other countries is described above under the section entitled “Regulation” in Item 1. “Business”, of this Form 10-K.  Legal, Economic and Regulatory Risks of Operating in Foreign Jurisdictions  Moody’s maintains offices outside the U.S. and derives a significant and increasing portion of its revenue from sources outside the U.S. In addition to the regulatory risks discussed above, operations in different countries expose Moody’s to a number of legal, economic and regulatory risks such as restrictions on the ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and currency fluctuations; U.S. laws affecting overseas operations including regulations applicable under the Office of Foreign Asset Control and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; domestic and foreign export and import restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers; political and economic instability; the possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls and other restrictive governmental actions; longer payment cycles and possible problems in collecting receivables; and potentially adverse tax consequences.  In addition to competition from other rating agencies that operate in a number of international jurisdictions and specialized companies that provide ratings for particular types of financial products or issuers (such as A.M. Best Company, Inc., with respect to the insurance industry), in many foreign countries Moody’s will have to compete with rating agencies that may have a stronger local presence and greater familiarity or a longer operating history in those markets. These local providers or comparable competitors that may emerge in the future may receive support from local governments or other institutions that Moody’s does not receive, putting Moody’s at a competitive disadvantage.  Uncertain Impact of Government Actions to Stabilize Financial Institutions and Markets  The U.S. government announced several programs in 2008, including the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, the October 14, 2008 joint statement by the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC announcing the Troubled Asset Relief Program through which the government is authorized to purchase up to $700 billion in whole loans and mortgage-related securities as well as to invest directly in financial institutions, the Treasury Department’s money market mutual fund guaranty program, the Federal Reserve’s commercial paper funding facility and payment of interest on reserve balances, the FDIC’s temporary liquidity guarantee program and the February 10, 2009 statement by the U.S. Treasury. Additionally, the governments of many nations and international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund have announced similar measures for institutions and countries around the world. There is no assurance that these programs individually or collectively will have beneficial effects in the credit markets, will address credit or liquidity issues of companies that participate in the programs, will reduce volatility or uncertainty in the financial markets or will reverse or moderate the slowdown and downturn of world economies. The failure of these programs to have their intended effects could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these and           MOODY’S 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS   19    Table of Contents    similar initiatives could reduce the demand for ratings of credit securities or other financial products, could result in increased government regulation of such markets and could have other unanticipated adverse effects on the markets for and demand for debt securities and/or for ratings of such instruments.  Increased Pricing Pressure from Competitors and/or Customers  In the credit rating, research and credit risk management markets, competition for customers and market share has spurred more aggressive tactics by some competitors in areas such as pricing and service. At the same time, bankruptcies and consolidation of customers, particularly those involved in structured finance products, and other factors affecting demand may enhance the market power of customers. While Moody’s seeks to compete primarily on the basis of the quality of its products and service, if its pricing and services are not sufficiently competitive with its current and future competitors, Moody’s may lose market share.  Introduction of Competing Products or Technologies by Other Companies  The markets for credit ratings, research and credit risk management services are highly competitive. The ability to provide innovative products and technologies that anticipate customers’ changing requirements and to utilize emerging technological trends is a key factor in maintaining market share. Competitors may develop quantitative methodologies or related services for assessing credit risk that customers and market participants may deem preferable, more cost-effective or more valuable than the credit risk assessment methods currently employed by Moody’s, or may price or market their products in manners that differ from those utilized by the Company. Customers or others may develop alternative, proprietary systems for assessing credit risk. Such developments could affect demand for Moody’s products and the Company’s growth prospects. In addition, Moody’s growth prospects also could be adversely affected by limitations of its information technologies that fail to provide adequate capacity and capabilities to meet increased demands of producing quality ratings and research products at levels achieved by competitors.  Exposure to Litigation Related to Moody’s Rating Opinions  Currently, Moody’s has received subpoenas and inquiries from states attorneys general and governmental authorities, as part of ongoing investigations, and is cooperating with those inquiries. In addition, Moody’s faces litigation from parties claiming damages relating to ratings actions, as well as other related actions. In these difficult economic times, when the value of credit-dependent instruments has declined and defaults have increased, the number of investigations and legal proceedings Moody’s is facing has increased. These proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company, which may increase over time as these matters progress procedurally, require the attention of senior management to an extent that may reduce their ability to devote significant time addressing other business issues, and may result in fines or damages if we are deemed to have violated any laws or regulations. As Moody’s international business expands, these types of claims may increase or become more costly because foreign jurisdictions may not have legal protections or liability standards comparable to those in the U.S. (such as protections for the expression of credit opinions as provided by the First Amendment and may pose criminal rather than civil penalties for non-compliance). These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover them, and their existence and magnitude often remains unknown for substantial periods of time.  Exposure to Reputational and Credibility Concerns  Moody’s reputation is one of the key bases on which the Company competes. To the extent that the rating agency business as a whole or that Moody’s, relative to its competitors, suffers a loss in credibility, Moody’s business could be adversely affected. Factors that could affect credibility include, potentially, the performance of securities relative to the rating assigned to such securities by a particular rating agency, the timing and nature of changes in ratings, adverse publicity as to the ratings process and the appearance of a conflict of interest.  Possible Loss of Key Employees and Related Compensation Cost Pressures  Moody’s success depends in part upon recruiting and retaining highly skilled, experienced financial analysts and other professionals. Competition for qualified staff in the financial services industry is intense, and Moody’s ability to attract staff could be impaired if it is unable to offer competitive compensation and other incentives or if the regulatory environment mandates restrictions on or disclosures about individual employees that would not be necessary in competing analytical industries. Investment banks, investors and competitors may seek to attract analyst talent by offering higher compensation than Moody’s or providing more favorable working conditions. Moody’s also may not be able to identify and hire employees in some markets outside the U.S. with the required experience or skills to perform sophisticated credit analysis. Moody’s may also lose key employees due to other factors, such as catastrophes, that could lead to disruption of business operations. Moody’s ability to compete effectively will continue to depend, among other things, on its ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate existing employees.          20   MOODY’S 2008 ANNUAL REPORT FINANCIALS    Table of Contents   Moody’s Operations and Infrastructure may Malfunction or Fail  Moody’s ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and the communities in which Moody’s is located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications or other services used by the Company or third parties with or through whom Moody’s conducts business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism or war or otherwise. Moody’s efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of major operating systems may not be successful. The Company does not have fully redundant systems for most of its smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and its disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of Moody’s locations or systems and its personnel in those locations or who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, its ability to service and interact with Moody’s clients and customers may suffer.  The Company’s operations also rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Although Moody’s takes protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events occur, this could jeopardize Moody’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, its computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the Company’s, its clients’, its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations. Moody’s may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and the Company may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Moody’s.
