BUSINESS  Overview  KeyCorp, organized in 1958 under the laws of the State of Ohio, is headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and are one of the nation’s largest bank-based financial services companies, with consolidated total assets of approximately $89.2 billion at December 31, 2012. KeyCorp is the parent holding company for KeyBank National Association (“KeyBank”), its principal subsidiary, through which most of our banking services are provided. Through KeyBank and certain other subsidiaries, we provide a wide range of retail and commercial banking, commercial leasing, investment management, consumer finance and investment banking products and services to individual, corporate and institutional clients through two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  As of December 31, 2012, these services were provided across the country through KeyBank’s 1,088 full-service retail banking branches in 14 states, additional offices, a telephone banking call center services group and a network of 1,611 automated teller machines (“ATMs”) in 15 states. Additional information pertaining to our two business segments is included in this report in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in the “Line of Business Results” section, and in Note 21 (“Line of Business Results”) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data are incorporated herein by reference. KeyCorp and its subsidiaries had an average of 15,589 full-time equivalent employees for 2012.  In addition to the customary banking services of accepting deposits and making loans, our bank and trust company subsidiaries offer personal and corporate trust services, personal financial services, access to mutual funds, cash management services, investment banking and capital markets products, and international banking services. Through our bank, trust companies and registered investment adviser subsidiaries, we provide investment management services to clients that include large corporate and public retirement plans, foundations and endowments, high-net-worth individuals and multi-employer trust funds established for providing pension or other benefits to employees.  We provide other financial services — both within and outside of our primary banking markets — through various nonbank subsidiaries. These services include community development financing, securities underwriting and brokerage. We also are an equity participant in a joint venture that provides merchant services to businesses.  KeyCorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banks and other subsidiaries. Accordingly, the right of KeyCorp, its security holders and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its banks and other subsidiaries is subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such banks and other subsidiaries, except to the extent that KeyCorp’s claims in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.  Important Terms Used in this Report  As used in this report, references to “Key,” “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. KeyCorp refers solely to the parent holding company, and KeyBank refers solely to KeyCorp’s subsidiary, KeyBank National Association.  The acronyms and abbreviations identified in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) hereof are used throughout this report, particularly in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements as well as in the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations.

Key Corporate Bank includes three lines of business that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network: Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services; Equipment Finance; and Institutional and Capital Markets.  The Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services business consists of two business units:      —    Real Estate Capital professionals are located in select markets across the country and provide financial services for public and private owners, investors and developers of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate properties. In addition to direct loans, this business unit is a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriter and Servicer, Freddie Mac Program Plus Seller/Servicer and FHA-approved mortgagee. KeyBank Real Estate Capital is also one of the nation’s largest and highest rated commercial mortgage servicers. Figure 20, which appears later in this report in the “Loans and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location.      —    Corporate Banking Services provides cash management, interest rate derivatives, and foreign exchange products and services to existing clients. Through its Public Sector and Financial Institutions businesses, Corporate Banking Services also provides a full array of commercial banking products and services to government and not-for-profit entities and to community banks. A variety of cash management services are provided through the Global Treasury Management unit.  Equipment Finance is one of the largest bank-based equipment finance providers based in the U.S. This business unit meets the equipment financing needs of companies worldwide and provides equipment manufacturers, distributors and resellers with a platform and funding options for their clients. Equipment Finance specializes in the technology, healthcare, and renewable energy markets as well as the finance needs related to other capital assets.    5    The Institutional and Capital Markets business consists of two business units:      —    KeyBanc Capital Markets provides commercial lending, treasury management, investment banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, equity and debt underwriting and trading, and syndicated finance products and services, primarily to emerging and middle-market companies in the Industrial, Consumer, Real Estate, Energy, Technology and Healthcare sectors. This business unit’s focused industry expertise and its consistent, integrated team approach, help our clients achieve their strategic objectives.      —    Victory Capital Management is an investment advisory firm that manages or offers advice regarding investment portfolios. This business unit’s national client base consists of both institutional and retail clients derived from four primary channels: public plans, Taft-Hartley plans, corporations, and endowments and foundations.  The products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments are described further in this report in Note 21 (“Line of Business Results”).

Acquisitions and Divestitures  The information presented in Note 13 (“Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations”) is incorporated herein by reference.  Competition  The market for banking and related financial services is highly competitive. Key competes with other providers of financial services, such as bank holding companies, commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local, regional and national institutions that offer financial services. Many of our competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures. The financial services industry is likely to become more competitive as further technology advances enable more companies to provide financial services. Technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial institutions. We compete by offering quality products and innovative services at competitive prices, and by maintaining our products and services offerings to keep pace with customer preferences and industry standards.  In recent years, mergers and acquisitions have led to greater concentration in the banking industry, placing added competitive pressure on Key’s core banking products and services. Consolidation continued during 2012 and led to redistribution of deposits and certain banking assets to larger financial institutions, including through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) least-cost resolution process, albeit at a far slower pace than 2011 and 2010. Financial institutions with liquidity challenges sought mergers and other resolutions, and the deposits and certain banking assets of the 300 banks that failed between 2010 and 2012, representing $138.6 billion in total assets, were redistributed through the FDIC’s least-cost resolution process.  Supervision and Regulation  The following discussion addresses elements of the regulatory framework applicable to BHCs and banks and provides certain specific information regarding material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us. This regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect customers and depositors, the DIF and the banking system as a whole, rather than for the protection of security holders and creditors. Comprehensive reform of the legislative and regulatory environment occurred in 2010 and remains ongoing resulting from enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. We cannot predict changes in the applicable laws, regulations and regulatory agency policies, yet such changes may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and access to liquidity or credit.  General  As a BHC, KeyCorp is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA. Under the BHCA, BHCs may not, in general, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of any bank, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. In addition, BHCs are generally prohibited from engaging in commercial or industrial activities.    7    Under the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve policy, a BHC is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at a time when we may not have the resources to, or would choose not to, provide it. Certain loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits in, and certain other indebtedness of, the subsidiary bank. In addition, federal law provides that in the event of a bankruptcy, any commitment by a BHC to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.  Federal law also establishes a system of prudential and functional federal regulation under which the Federal Reserve is the umbrella regulator for BHCs, while their affiliates are principally regulated by prudential and functional regulators such as the OCC for national banks and federal savings associations, the FDIC for non-member state banks and savings associations, the Federal Reserve for member state banks, the CFPB for federal consumer financial laws and consumer financial products or services, the SEC and FINRA for securities broker/dealer activities, the SEC and CFTC for swaps and other derivatives, and state insurance regulators for insurance activities. Certain specific activities, including traditional bank trust and fiduciary activities, may be conducted in a bank without the bank being deemed a “broker” or a “dealer” in securities for purposes of securities functional regulation. Although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner, the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain identifiable risks.  Our national bank subsidiaries and their subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. At December 31, 2012, we operated one full-service, FDIC-insured national bank subsidiary, KeyBank, and two national bank subsidiaries that are limited to fiduciary activities. The FDIC also has certain regulatory, supervisory and examination authority over KeyBank and KeyCorp under the FDIA and Dodd-Frank Act.  We have other financial services subsidiaries that are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as other applicable state and federal regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Our securities brokerage and asset management subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance regulatory authorities of the states in which they operate. Our other nonbank subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they are authorized to do business.  Regulatory Reform Developments  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act became law. It was intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the U.S., reduce the risks of bank failures, better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of bank and nonbank SIFIs, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank. The following provides a summary of relevant regulatory developments relating to the Dodd-Frank Act.  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB as a new consumer financial services regulator. We are now subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the CFPB. The CFPB supervises banks and their affiliates, such as Key, with assets of more than $10 billion for compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB also regulates consumer financial products and services sold by banks and non-bank companies and has rule making authority with respect to federal consumer financial laws. Any new regulatory requirements promulgated by the CFPB or modifications in the interpretations of existing regulations could require changes to our consumer businesses. In addition, we may face potential enforcement actions by the CFPB and civil actions by state attorneys general for violation of various state and federal consumer protection laws.    8    On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued its final rule to implement sections of the Dodd-Frank Act that will require lenders to verify a consumer’s ability to repay a mortgage loan. The rule establishes certain minimum requirements for creditors when making ability to pay determinations, and establishes certain protections from liability for mortgages meeting the definition of “qualified mortgages”. The final rule becomes effective on January 10, 2014. We are currently analyzing the final rule in order to determine its impact on Key’s mortgage lending business.  The CFPB issued its final rules on January 17, 2013, to implement sections of the Dodd-Frank Act addressing certain obligations of mortgage servicers to correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers and to provide certain information requested by such borrowers. The final rules also: impose requirements on a mortgage servicer in connection with the force placement of collateral insurance; mandate certain notices prior to rate adjustments on adjustable-rate mortgages; and establish requirements for periodic disclosures to borrowers. These rules will apply directly to Key and to any third-party mortgage servicer engaged by Key, and become effective on January 10, 2014.  Financial Stability Oversight Council  Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC as a new systemic risk oversight body to identify, monitor and address potential threats to U.S. financial stability. We are now subject to oversight and regulation by the FSOC. The FSOC is responsible for identifying systemic risks, promoting stronger financial regulation and identifying those non-bank companies that are systemically important and thus should be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. In addition, in extraordinary cases the FSOC, together with the Federal Reserve, could require the breakup of financial firms that are deemed to present a grave threat to U.S. financial stability.  “Volcker Rule”  Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act added new Section 13 to the BHCA, which is referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule prohibits an insured depository institution and its affiliates from engaging in certain types of proprietary trading and restricts the ability of banks to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds. Key is affected by some parts of the Volcker Rule, but the effect is uncertain until the final rule is implemented. The scope of the proprietary trading prohibition, and its impact on Key, will depend on the definitions in the final rule, particularly those definitions related to statutory exemptions for risk-mitigating hedging activities; market-making; and customer-related activities. In addition, the final rule is expected to include restrictions on Key’s private equity and hedge fund activities. As of December 31, 2012, our principal investments and real estate capital lines of business hold certain investments not exceeding $450 million that we expect may be subject to certain limitations under the final Volcker Rule. Under the proposed rulemaking announced on October 11, 2011, we expect to be able to hold these investments until July 2014 with no restriction, and be eligible to obtain up to three one-year extension periods, subject to regulatory approvals. A forced sale of some of these investments could result in Key receiving less value than it would otherwise have received. Depending on the provisions of the final Volcker Rule, it is possible that other structures through which Key conducts business, but that are not typically referred to as private equity or hedge funds, could be restricted with an impact that cannot yet be evaluated.  Debit Card Interchange  Federal Reserve Regulation II — Debit II — Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing — limits debit card interchange fees, eliminates exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions, and imposes limits for restrictions on merchant discounting for the use of certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards. The relevant portions of Regulation II became effective October 1, 2011.  Resolution Plans  BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including KeyCorp, are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be resolved in a rapid and orderly fashion if the company were to fail or experience material financial distress. In a related rulemaking, the    9     FDIC adopted a final rule on January 23, 2012, requiring insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including KeyBank, to prepare and submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. The initial plans for KeyCorp and KeyBank are each due December 31, 2013, and updated plans must be submitted annually thereafter.  Enhanced Prudential Standards  On January 5, 2012, the Federal Reserve published proposed Regulation YY — Enhanced Prudential Standards — as part of its efforts to implement enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements to be imposed upon SIFIs pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. It generally applies to SIFIs like KeyCorp and includes a wide range of measures addressing issues such as risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, single-counterparty credit limits, risk management, supervisory and company-run stress testing requirements, and early remediation. As indicated below, the Federal Reserve has finalized Regulation YY only with respect to supervisory and company-run stress testing requirements.  Supervisory and Company-Run Stress Testing  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to conduct an annual supervisory stress test on certain banking organizations, including KeyCorp, to evaluate whether they have sufficient capital, on a total consolidated basis, to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. Stress testing scenarios (including those describing hypothetical baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic and financial conditions) were published by the Federal Reserve. On January 28, 2013, the Federal Reserve announced that it will release results from the supervisory stress tests conducted on KeyCorp and other banking organizations on March 7, 2013. Under the final rule, we are required to consider the results of the stress test as part of our capital planning process and must update our resolution plan as the Federal Reserve determines appropriate based on the results of the stress test.  Company-run stress tests conducted by KeyCorp and KeyBank are also required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Stress testing scenarios (including those describing hypothetical baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic and financial conditions) were published by the Federal Reserve and OCC. Results of these stress tests were reported to the Federal Reserve and OCC on January 7, 2013, and will be publicly disclosed (the first public disclosure is required by the rules to be made between March 15 and March 31, 2013).  Credit Risk Retention Requirements  Section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal banking agencies and the SEC to jointly prescribe regulations to require any securitizer to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any asset that the securitizer transfers to a third party through the issuance of an asset-backed security. It also requires these agencies, together with the FHFA and HUD, to jointly prescribe regulations to require any securitizer to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for any residential mortgage asset that the securitizer transfers to a third party through the issuance of an asset-backed security. These agencies jointly proposed the required regulations in 2011, but have not yet published their final rules. The rules are required to become effective for residential mortgage securitizations one year after publication of final rules and for other securitizations two years after publication of the final rules in the Federal Register.  The proposed rules provide a menu of numerous alternatives for meeting the risk retention requirements, including some options available for any type of securitization and others specifically designed for certain asset classes. They would also provide a full exemption from the risk retention requirements for securitizations backed by residential mortgages, commercial loans, commercial real estate loans and automobile loans meeting certain precisely specified product and underwriting criteria.  We are a significant servicer of commercial mortgages held by others, including securitization vehicles. We anticipate that these Dodd-Frank Act credit risk retention requirements will impact the market for loans of types that historically have been securitized, potentially affecting the volumes of loans securitized, the types of loan    10     products made available, the terms on which loans are offered, consumer and business demand for loans, and the need for third party loan servicers. The risk retention rules themselves could have the effect of slowing the rebound in the securitization markets and, as a result, may impact the willingness of banks, including us, to make loans due to balance sheet management requirements.  Derivatives  Dodd-Frank imposes a new regulatory regime on the U.S. derivatives markets. While some of the provisions related to derivatives markets went into effect on July 16, 2011, many of the new requirements await final regulations from the relevant regulatory agencies for derivatives, the CFTC and the SEC. One aspect of this new regulatory regime for derivatives is that substantial oversight responsibility has been provided to the CFTC, which, as a result, will for the first time have a meaningful supervisory role with respect to some of our businesses. Although the ultimate impact will depend on the final regulations, we expect that our derivatives business will likely be subject to new substantive requirements, including registration with the CFTC, margin requirements in excess of current market practice, capital requirements specific to this business, real time trade reporting and robust record keeping requirements, business conduct requirements (including daily valuations, disclosure of material risks associated with swaps and disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of interest), and mandatory clearing and exchange trading of all standardized swaps designated by the relevant regulatory agencies as required to be cleared. These requirements will collectively impose implementation and ongoing compliance burdens on us and will introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action). Depending on the final rules that relate to our swaps businesses, the nature and extent of those businesses may change.  Preemption  Federal preemption and the application of state consumer protection laws to national banks is still an evolving area of the law. Depending on how such questions are ultimately resolved, as a national bank with multi-state operations and a multi-state customer base, KeyBank may experience an increase in state and local regulation of our retail banking business and additional compliance obligations, revenue impacts and costs.  New Assessments, Fees and Other Charges  Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require or authorize certain U.S. governmental departments, agencies and instrumentalities to collect new assessments, fees and other charges from BHCs and banks, like KeyCorp and KeyBank, regardless of risk. For example, on May 21, 2012, the U.S. Treasury adopted a final rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishing an assessment schedule for SIFIs to collect semiannual assessments to pay the expenses of the OFR, including the expenses of the FSOC and certain expenses for implementing the orderly liquidation activities of the FDIC. The assessment upon KeyCorp is based on Key’s average total consolidated assets as reported in its Federal Reserve regulatory reports over four quarters preceding the relevant determination date. Key’s initial semiannual assessment of $684,250 was collected on July 20, 2012. Similarly, and although no proposals have yet been issued, Section 318 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve, and authorizes the OCC and FDIC, to charge SIFIs and institutions regulated by these agencies new assessments, fees and other charges in connection with their examination, supervision, and regulation of such companies.  Bank Transactions with Affiliates  Federal banking law and the regulations adopted to implement it impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions by a bank with its affiliates, including the bank’s parent BHC and certain companies in which it may have as little as a 15% equity interest or may otherwise be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on arm’s length terms, and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a    11     loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it. These provisions materially restrict the ability of KeyBank, as a bank, to fund its affiliates, including KeyCorp, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Victory Capital Advisers, Inc., any of the Victory mutual funds, and KeyCorp’s nonbanking subsidiaries engaged in making merchant banking investments (and certain companies in which these subsidiaries have invested).  Provisions added by the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the scope of (i) the definition of “affiliate” to include any “investment fund” having any bank or BHC affiliated company as an investment adviser, (ii) credit exposures subject to the prohibition on the acceptance of low-quality assets or securities issued by an affiliate as collateral, the quantitative limits, and the collateralization requirements to now include credit exposures arising out of derivative, repurchase agreement, and securities lending/borrowing transactions, and (iii) transactions subject to quantitative limits to now also include credit collateralized by affiliate-issued debt obligations that are not securities. In addition, these provisions require that a credit extension to an affiliate remain secured in accordance with the collateral requirements “at all times” that it is outstanding, rather than the previous requirement of only at the inception or upon material modification of the transaction. They also raise significantly the procedural and substantive hurdles required to obtain a regulatory exemption from the affiliate transaction requirements. These provisions became effective on July 21, 2012, and the Federal Reserve has indicated that a proposed rule is expected to be released in 2013. Until the Federal Reserve publishes final rules, it will be difficult to assess the impact of these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Capital  Current Regulatory Capital Requirements  Federal banking regulators have promulgated risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements applicable to BHCs and their bank subsidiaries. Adequacy of regulatory capital is assessed periodically by the federal banking agencies in the examination and supervision process, and in the evaluation of applications in connection with specific transactions and activities, including acquisitions, expansion of existing activities and commencement of new activities.  Under the current risk-based capital requirements, KeyCorp and its bank subsidiaries are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets (which include certain off-balance sheet exposures) of 8%. At least half of the total capital must be composed of common shareholders’ equity excluding the over- or underfunded status of post-retirement benefit obligations, unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale, unrealized gains on equity securities available for sale, and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges, net of deferred income taxes; plus certain mandatorily redeemable equity investments. This is called “Tier 1 capital.” The remainder may consist of qualifying subordinated debt, certain hybrid capital instruments, qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses. This is called “Tier 2 capital.”  Federal banking regulators also have established minimum leverage ratio requirements for banking organizations. The leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average total assets. The minimum leverage ratio is currently 3% for BHCs that are considered “strong” by the Federal Reserve or which have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-based capital measure for market risk. Similarly, the minimum leverage ratio is currently 3% for national banks considered “strong” by the OCC. Other BHCs and national banks must have a minimum leverage ratio of 4%.  Pursuant to Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the risk-based and leverage capital standards that were in effect prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions are imposed upon U.S. BHCs like KeyCorp, subject to a phased-in three year transition period that began on January 1, 2013. One effect of this provision is to eliminate trust preferred securities at the U.S. BHC level as an element of Tier 1 capital.    12    BHCs and banks with securities and commodities trading activities that exceed specified levels are required to maintain capital for market risk. Market risk includes changes in the market value of trading account, foreign exchange and commodity positions, whether resulting from broad market movements (such as changes in the general level of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices) or from position specific factors (such as idiosyncratic variation, event risk and default risk).  On January 1, 2013, a joint final rule to implement changes to the market risk capital rule became effective, replacing the rule that originally was adopted effective January 1, 1997. It applies to banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank, with trading assets and liabilities of at least $1 billion, or 10% of total assets. The rule changes the methodology for calculating the risk-weighted assets related to trading assets and includes, among other things, the addition of a stressed VaR component. Additionally, the rule eliminates the use of credit ratings in calculating specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions. We do not currently anticipate that the changes to this rule will have a material impact on Key’s or KeyBank’s risk-weighted assets or capital ratios.  BHCs and national banks may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels, depending upon their particular condition, risk profile or growth plans. At December 31, 2012, Key and KeyBank had regulatory capital in excess of all current minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements.  The FDIA requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a FDIC-insured depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Such institutions are grouped into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories — well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized — using the Tier 1 risk-based, total risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures. An institution is considered well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.00%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.00% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.00% and is not subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At December 31, 2012, KeyBank satisfied the criteria for the prompt corrective action well-capitalized capital category. Federal law also requires that the bank regulatory agencies implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within the five capital categories, with progressively more restrictions on operations, management and capital distributions.  The prompt corrective action requirements apply only to FDIC-insured depository institutions and not to BHCs. However, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against the BHC based on the undercapitalized status of any such subsidiary institution and, in certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary institution. Nevertheless, if such prompt corrective action capital categories applied to BHCs, we believe that KeyCorp would satisfy the criteria for the well-capitalized capital category at December 31, 2012. An institution’s prompt corrective action capital category, however, may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of the institution or parent BHC, and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the financial condition and results of operations of the institution and its parent BHC.  Basel Accords  Basel I  The current minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies and applicable to Key and described above are based on a 1988 international accord (“Basel I”) that was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”).  Basel III Capital and Liquidity Framework  In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (“Basel III”). Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the    13     regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. These measures aim to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, improve risk management and governance, and strengthen banks’ transparency and disclosures. Basel III requires higher and better-quality capital, better risk coverage, the introduction of a new leverage ratio as a backstop to the risk-based requirement, measures to promote the buildup of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress, and the introduction of two global liquidity standards.  The Basel III final capital framework, among other things, introduces as a new capital measure, “common equity Tier 1,” and specifies that Tier 1 capital consists of common equity Tier 1 and “additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements.  The implementation of the Basel III final capital framework commenced January 1, 2013 and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. Beginning January 2013, banks with regulators adopting these standards in full are required to meet the following minimum capital ratios; 3.5% common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets, 4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets. The implementation of a capital conservation buffer, effectively raising the minimum capital requirements, will begin on January 1, 2016, at 0.625% and be phased-in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  When fully phased-in, the Basel III capital framework will require banks to maintain: (a) a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer; (b) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 6%, plus the capital conservation buffer; (c) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer; and (d) a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). Thus, when the capital conservation buffer is fully phased-in, minimum ratios will effectively be 7% for common equity Tier 1, 8.5% for Tier 1 capital and 10.5% for total capital, with the 3% leverage ratio being maintained. Basel III also provides for a “countercyclical capital buffer,” generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a common equity Tier 1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).  The Basel III final capital framework provides for a number of adjustments to, including new deductions from, Tier 1 capital. These include, for example, the inclusion of the mark to market on the available for sale investment securities portfolio, the deduction of the defined pension benefit asset, the deduction of certain deferred tax assets, and the requirement that mortgage servicing rights and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from common equity Tier 1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of common equity Tier 1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of common equity Tier 1. Implementation of the adjustments and new deductions from common equity Tier 1 will begin on January 1, 2014, and will be phased-in over a five-year period (20% per year).  The final Basel III liquidity framework requires banks to comply with two measures of liquidity risk exposure:        —    the “liquidity coverage ratio,” based on a 30-day time horizon and calculated as the ratio of the “stock of high-quality liquid assets” divided by “total net cash outflows over the next 30 calendar days,” which must be at least 100%; and        —    the “net stable funding ratio,” calculated as the ratio of the “available amount of stable funding” divided by the “required amount of stable funding,” which must be at least 100%.  Both of these measures are subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements. The Basel III liquidity framework provides specifically that revisions to the liquidity coverage ratio will be made by mid-2013, with such ratio being introduced as a requirement on January 1, 2015, revisions to the net stable funding ratio will be made by mid-2016, and the net stable funding ratio will be introduced as a requirement on January 1, 2018.    14    In January 2013, the Basel Committee issued its revisions to the liquidity coverage ratio. Important changes include a phased-in implementation (introduction as planned on January 1, 2015, but with minimum requirements beginning at 60%, rising in equal annual steps of 10% to reach full implementation on January 1, 2019), an expansion of the range of assets eligible to be high-quality liquid assets, and some refinements to the assumed inflow and outflow rates to better reflect actual experience in times of stress.  Given our strong capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the Basel III capital framework when corresponding U.S. capital regulations are finalized. While we have a strong liquidity position, the Basel III liquidity framework could require us and other U.S. banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives, including adding additional liquid assets, issuing term debt, and modifying our product pricing for loans, commitments, and deposits. U.S. regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the Basel III liquidity framework. Accordingly, at this point it is premature to assess its impact.  Proposed Implementation of the Basel III Capital Framework  On August 30, 2012, the federal banking agencies jointly published three separate NPRs seeking comment on proposed rules that would revise and replace their current capital rules in a manner consistent both with relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as the implementation of the Basel III capital framework. The comment period on these NPRs ended on October 22, 2012.  One NPR (the “Basel III NPR”) proposes the majority of the revisions to international capital standards in Basel III, including a more restrictive definition of regulatory capital (such as providing for the phase-out of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital), higher minimum regulatory capital requirements, and the imposition of capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers. It also proposes limitations on certain distributions and discretionary bonuses as well as revisions to the agencies’ prompt corrective action regulations. Another NPR (the “Standardized Approach NPR”) proposes new methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets, such as by expanding the number and type of exposure categories, providing a more comprehensive recognition of collateral and guarantees, and introducing or applying more risk-sensitive treatment for certain exposures (including certain high-volatility commercial real estate, corporate, equity, foreign, securitization, derivative, residential mortgage, and 90 day or more past due exposures). It also proposes detailed qualitative and quantitative public disclosure requirements relating to capital adequacy. The final NPR (the “Advanced Approaches NPR”) proposes to revise the current advanced approaches risk-based capital rule to incorporate certain aspects of Basel III as well as certain other revisions to the Basel capital framework published by the Basel Committee between 2009-2011. While Key and KeyBank are subject to the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs, they are not subject to the Advanced Approaches NPR.  Implementation of the Basel III final capital framework was proposed to begin on January 1, 2013, with minimum capital ratios and prompt corrective action requirements implemented by January 1, 2015, and the capital conservation buffer phased-in from January 1, 2016, through January 1, 2019. On November 9, 2012, however, the agencies issued a joint press release (the “November 2012 Release”) indicating that none of the Basel III, Standardized Approach, and Advanced Approaches NPRs would become effective on January 1, 2013, and that the agencies would take operational and other considerations into account when determining appropriate implementation dates and associated transition periods for them.  New Proposed Minimum Capital Requirements  As originally proposed, beginning January 1, 2013, banking organizations subject to the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs, like Key, would be required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in the following table. At December 31, 2012, Key had a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 11.36% under current Basel I. Also at December 31, 2012, based on the fully phased-in Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after adjustment for market risk pursuant to the new joint final market risk rule, would be as set forth in the following table. There can be no guarantee, however, that the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs will be adopted in their current form, what changes may be made before adoption, or when ultimate adoption will occur.    15    Estimated Ratios vs. Proposed Minimum Capital Ratios Calculated Under the Fully Phased-In Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs                                    Ratios (including Capital conservation buffer)    Key  12-31-2012Estimated            ProposedMinimum1-1-2013      (a)      Phase-in  Period    (a)   ProposedMinimum1-1-2019      (a)     Common Equity Tier 1     10.4       %       3.5       %     1/1/13 - 1/1/15        4.5       %     Capital conservation buffer (b)               —           1/1/16 - 1/1/19        2.5          Common Equity Tier 1 + Capital conservation buffer               3.5          1/1/13 - 1/1/19        7.0          Tier 1 Capital     10.7            4.5          1/1/13 - 1/1/15        6.0          Tier 1 Capital + Capital conservation buffer               4.5          1/1/13 - 1/1/19        8.5          Total Capital     13.5            8.0          None        8.0          Total Capital + Capital conservation buffer               8.0          1/1/16 - 1/1/19        10.5          Leverage (c)     10.2               4.0             None         4.0                (a) Per the November 2012 Release, the proposed implementation dates and phase-in periods are subject to extension.

Key is not subject to the proposed countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed under the Advanced Approaches NPR.      (c) Key is not subject to the proposed 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement imposed under the Advanced Approaches NPR.  Revised Prompt Corrective Action Standards  Under the Basel III NPR, the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as KeyBank, are proposed to be revised. The table below identifies the proposed capital category threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under current law and the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs.  Proposed Revised Prompt Corrective Action Well Capitalized and Adequately Capitalized Capital Category Ratios                                         Prompt Corrective Action   Capital Category            Well Capitalized     Adequately Capitalized          Ratio   Proposed            Current            Proposed            Current           Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based     6.5       %       N/A            4.5       %       N/A          Tier 1 Risk-Based     8.0            6.0       %       6.0            4.0       %     Total Risk-Based     10.0            10.0            8.0            8.0          Tier 1 Leverage     5.0               5.0               4.0               3.0 or 4.0         We believe that, as of December 31, 2012, Key and KeyBank would meet all capital adequacy and corrective action capital and leverage ratio requirements under the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective. There can be no guarantee that the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs will be adopted in their current form, what changes may be made before adoption, or when ultimate adoption will occur.  As previously indicated, the prompt corrective action requirements apply only to FDIC-insured depository institutions and not to BHCs. Nevertheless, if such prompt corrective action capital categories applied to BHCs, we believe that KeyCorp would meet all prompt corrective action capital and leverage ratio requirements for a well-capitalized capital category at December 31, 2012, under the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective.    16    Capital Planning and Review of Capital Actions  U.S. BHCs with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion, including KeyCorp, must submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis and, notwithstanding written non-objection to the capital plan, must obtain in certain circumstances written approval or non-objection to make capital distributions. Such BHCs are also subject to Federal Reserve supervisory guidance with respect to the declaration and payment of dividends, capital redemptions, and capital repurchases in the context of such BHC’s capital planning processes, including the supervisory expectation for prior notification to, and consultation with, Federal Reserve supervisory staff regarding certain dividends and capital redemptions and repurchases.  The Federal Reserve’s supervisory review of a BHC’s capital plan includes an assessment of:        —    the comprehensiveness of the plan, including the extent to which the analysis underlying the plan captures and addresses potential risks stemming from all activities across the BHC under baseline and stressed operating conditions and the BHC’s capital policy;        —    the reasonableness of the BHC’s assumptions and analysis underlying the plan and the BHC’s methodologies for reviewing the robustness of the BHC’s capital adequacy process; and        —    the BHC’s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a Tier 1 common ratio of 5% on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon.  Nineteen of the largest BHCs, including KeyCorp, are required to submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve for CCAR. CCAR is an annual exercise by the Federal Reserve to ensure that the largest BHCs have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of financial and economic stress and robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks. As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates such BHC’s capital adequacy, internal capital adequacy assessment processes, and plans to take capital actions, including capital distributions. KeyCorp filed its CCAR 2013 capital plan on January 7, 2013. On January 28, 2013, the Federal Reserve announced that the results from CCAR 2013 will be released on March 14, 2013.  As part of CCAR, the Federal Reserve will continue to evaluate whether proposed capital actions are appropriate in light of the BHC’s plans to meet the proposed Basel III requirements. As part of its capital plan submission, the BHC should provide a transition plan that includes pro forma estimates under baseline conditions of the BHC’s regulatory capital ratios under the proposed Basel III capital framework as it would be implemented in the U.S. BHCs that meet the minimum ratio requirement during the Basel III transition period but remain below the 7% tier 1 common equity target (minimum plus capital conservation buffer) will be expected to maintain prudent earnings retention policies with a view to meeting the capital conservation buffer under the time-frame described in the Basel III NPR, subject to extension pursuant to the November 2012 Release.  The Federal Reserve will approve dividend increases or other capital distributions for companies whose capital plans are approved by regulators and who are able to demonstrate sufficient financial strength to continue to operate as financial intermediaries under stressed macroeconomic and financial market scenarios, even after making the planned capital distributions.  Dividend Restrictions  Federal banking law and regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends by our national bank subsidiaries. Historically, dividends paid by KeyBank have been an important source of cash flow for KeyCorp to pay dividends on its equity securities and interest on its debt. Our national bank subsidiaries are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under an earnings retention test and an undivided profits test. Under the earnings retention test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in    17     excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank’s undivided profits. In addition, if in the opinion of a federal banking agency a banking organization (such as KeyCorp and KeyBank) under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the organization, could include the payment of dividends), the agency may require that such organization cease and desist from such practice.  During 2012, KeyBank paid KeyCorp a total of $1.8 billion in dividends; nonbank subsidiaries did not pay any cash or noncash dividends to KeyCorp. As of January 1, 2013, KeyBank had fully utilized its regulatory capacity to pay dividends to KeyCorp. During 2012, KeyCorp did not make any capital infusions to KeyBank. At December 31, 2012, KeyCorp held $2.2 billion in short-term investments, which can be used to pay dividends to shareholders, service debt and finance corporate operations.  Federal Deposit Insurance Act  Deposit Insurance and Assessments  The FDIC’s DIF provides insurance coverage for domestic deposits, which insurance is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions, like KeyBank. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the amount of deposit insurance coverage for deposits increased permanently from $100,000 to $250,000 per depository, and the coverage of non-interest bearing transaction accounts was unlimited through December 31, 2012.  The FDIC assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to change the assessment base from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. KeyBank’s current annualized deposit insurance premium assessments range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its assessment base, depending on its scorecard performance factors incorporating KeyBank’s regulatory rating, ability to withstand asset and funding related stress, and relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank’s failure.  On October 31, 2012, the FDIC amended its large bank assessment final rule applicable to KeyBank. The amendment revises the definitions of certain risk assets, specifically higher-risk commercial and industrial loans and securities and higher-risk consumer loans, clarifies when an asset must be identified as higher-risk, and clarifies the way securitizations are identified as higher-risk. These definitions affect the higher-risk concentration measure (higher-risk assets to Tier 1 capital and reserves) found in the large and highly complex institution scorecards. The amendment generally becomes effective on April 1, 2013. We estimate that our 2013 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be in the range of $37 to $41 million.  Conservatorship and Receivership of Institutions  Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, the FDIC will be appointed the conservator or receiver under the FDIA. In such an insolvency, the FDIC may repudiate or disaffirm any contract to which such institution is a party if the FDIC determines that performance of the contract would be burdensome, and that disaffirmance or repudiation of the contract would promote the orderly administration of the institution’s affairs. Such disaffirmance or repudiation would result in a claim by the other party to the contract against the receivership or conservatorship. The amount paid upon such claim would depend upon, among other factors, the amount of receivership assets available for the payment of such claim and the priority of the claim relative to the priority of others. In addition, the FDIC as conservator or receiver may enforce most contracts entered into by the institution notwithstanding any provision regarding termination, default, acceleration, or exercise of rights upon or solely by reason of insolvency of the institution, appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution, or exercise of rights or powers by a conservator or receiver for the institution. The FDIC as conservator or receiver also may transfer any asset or liability of the institution without obtaining any approval or consent of the institution’s shareholders or creditors. These provisions would be applicable to obligations and liabilities of Key’s bank subsidiaries that are insured depository institutions, such as KeyBank, including, without limitation, obligations under senior or subordinated debt issued by those banks to investors in the public markets.    18    Depositor Preference  The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of its depositors (including claims by the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors along with the FDIC will be placed ahead of unsecured, nondeposit creditors, including a parent BHC, such as KeyCorp, and subordinated creditors, in order of priority of payment.  The Bank Secrecy Act  The BSA requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. Key has established an anti-money laundering program to comply with the BSA requirements.      ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  An investment in our Common Shares or other securities is subject to risks inherent to our business and our industry. Described below are certain risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of which could have a material and adverse effect on us. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Although we have significant risk management policies, procedures and practices aimed at mitigating these risks, uncertainties may nevertheless impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.  IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND/OR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY AND/OR CREDIT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED (“MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US”). IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN, THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES — COMMON SHARES, SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND DEBT SECURITIES — COULD DECLINE, PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.  Our ERM program identifies Key’s major risk categories, including: market, compliance, credit, liquidity, and operational, together with reputation and strategic risks. The following risk factors are grouped into categories consistent with the five preceding main categories of risk focused on in our ERM program, with an additional category for risks related to investment in our Common Shares.  I. Market Risks  The global financial markets continue to be strained as a result of economic slowdowns and concerns, especially about the creditworthiness of the European Union and its member states and financial institutions in the European Union. These factors could have international implications, which could hinder the U.S. economic recovery and affect the stability of global financial markets.  Certain European Union member states have fiscal obligations greater than their fiscal revenue, which has caused investor concern over such countries’ ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth in their economies. During 2012, the European debt crisis caused spreads to widen in the fixed income debt markets and liquidity to be less abundant. While the situation has started to stabilize, the European debt crisis and measures adopted to address it have significantly weakened European economies. A weaker European economy may cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of European financial institutions and the stability of European member economies.    19    A failure to adequately address sovereign debt concerns in Europe could hamper economic recovery or contribute to recessionary economic conditions and severe stress in the financial markets, including in the United States. Potential events which could have such an impact on the financial markets include (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more European governments in their borrowings), (ii) European bank and/or corporate debt default, (iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, (iv) if stresses become especially severe, and the collapse of the European Union as a coherent economic group and/or the collapse of its currency, the Euro. Although a financial institution in the United States may have little to no exposure to European sovereign debt or Euro-denominated assets, the European and American financial markets are substantially linked, especially through the Federal Reserve, which at times has offered stimulus funding to European governments, and through larger U.S. financial institutions, which invest in European assets and institutions. Due to the interconnectedness of European and American financial markets, a liquidity freeze-up in Europe could detrimentally impact Key by causing, among other things, an increase in our cost of borrowed funds, an inability to borrow funds through conventional markets, negative impacts upon our counterparties and customers, especially those with European business relationships or European assets, and negative impacts upon the U.S. economy. Should the global financial markets and the U.S. economic recovery be adversely impacted by these factors, the likelihood for loan and asset growth at U.S. financial institutions, like Key, may deteriorate. Any combination of these factors may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  The U.S. economy remains vulnerable as the economic recovery continues to progress slowly.  The U.S. economy showed signs of moderate growth during the second half of 2012, despite slow growth during the first half of the year, according to the FOMC. Despite signs of growth, the recovery of the U.S. economy continues to progress slowly. Certain downside risks to the U.S. economy remain present. Strains in the global financial markets pose significant risk to the U.S. economy. High unemployment and underemployment, the slow pace of job creation, and slowing growth in business fixed investment are additional factors of concern. Fiscal austerity, in the form of higher taxes and spending cuts, would further hamper growth over the near-term, and policy uncertainty (another constraint on growth) may linger for some time. The U.S. economy could also be affected by the slowdown in economic activity abroad, especially in Europe, and the significant fiscal challenges that remain for local governments in the U.S.  The continuation or worsening of these factors could weaken the U.S. economic recovery underway. The downgrade of U.S. Treasury securities by S&P and political difficulties in addressing the economy within the U.S. government have contributed to high levels of volatility in the financial markets. Should economic indicators deteriorate, the U.S. could face another recession, which could affect us in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways, as well as affect our borrowers’ ability to meet their repayment obligations. We have taken steps since the 2008-2009 financial crisis to strengthen our liquidity position. Nevertheless, a return of the volatile economic conditions recently experienced, including the adverse conditions in the fixed income debt markets, for an extended period of time, particularly if left unmitigated by policy measures, may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  We are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our earnings on loans and other interest-earning assets.  Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. If the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest we receive on    20     loans and other investments, net interest income, and therefore our earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings.  Our methods for simulating and analyzing our interest rate exposure are discussed more fully under the heading “Risk Management — Interest rate risk management” found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Although we believe that we have implemented effective asset and liability management strategies, including simulation analysis and the use of interest rate derivatives as hedging instruments, to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected and/or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate.  Our success depends primarily on economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. We have concentrations of loans and other business activities in geographic areas where our branches are located — the Rocky Mountains and Northwest, the Great Lakes and the Northeast — as well as potential exposure to geographic areas outside of our branch footprint. For example, the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate portfolio has exposures in markets outside of our footprint. The delinquencies, nonperforming loans and charge-offs that we have experienced since 2007 have been more heavily weighted to these specific markets. Real estate values and cash flows have been negatively affected on a national basis due to weak economic conditions. Certain markets, such as Florida, southern California, Phoenix, Arizona, and Las Vegas, Nevada, experienced more significant deterioration during the recession; while values have stabilized over the past year, they remain well below peak levels across markets. The regional economic conditions in areas in which we conduct our business have an impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources, and, in turn, may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  II. Compliance Risks  We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.  We are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial reform initiatives. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, the DIF and the banking system as a whole, not our debtholders or shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase our Common Shares, and growth, among other things.  Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation, and/or continuing to become subject to heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes may subject us to additional compliance costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, affect the investments we make and the manner in which we operate our businesses, increase our litigation and regulatory costs should we fail to appropriately comply with such laws, regulations or policies, and increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products. Any of these factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us. See “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1 of this Report for further information.  Additionally, federal banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal banking regulators. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. These enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. If we were the subject of an enforcement action, it could have a Material Adverse Effect on us.    21    The regulatory environment for the financial services industry is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the United States, including the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  The United States and other governments have undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. We have faced increased regulation of our industry, and will continue to face such regulation into 2013, as a result of current and future initiatives intended to provide economic stimulus, financial market stability, and enhancement of the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions. We have also faced increased regulation as a result of new efforts designed to protect consumers and investors from financial abuse.  We also expect more intense scrutiny from our bank supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels particularly due to both KeyBank’s and KeyCorp’s status as covered institutions for the enhanced prudential standards promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Although many parts of the Dodd-Frank Act are now in effect, other parts are still in the implementation stage, which is likely to continue for several years. Accordingly, some uncertainty remains as to the aggregate impact upon Key of the Dodd-Frank Act as fully implemented. Compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase our costs and reduce our revenue and may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities and to take certain types of corporate actions. For more detailed information on the regulatory environment and the laws, rules and regulations that may affect us, see “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1 of this report.  III. Credit Risks  Should the fundamentals of the commercial real estate market further deteriorate, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  The fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector are improving but remain relatively weak, under continuing pressure by reduced asset values, high vacancies and reduced rents. Commercial real estate values peaked in the fall of 2007. According to Moody’s Real Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Index, commercial real estate values were down approximately 22% from their peak as of November 2012. A portion of our commercial real estate loans are construction loans. These properties are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan, but the borrower may be reliant upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide cash flow to support debt service payments. If we experienced weaknesses similar to those experienced at the height of the economic downturn, then we would experience a slowing in the execution of new leases, which may also lead to existing lease turnover.  The U.S. economy remains highly vulnerable, and any reversal in broad macro trends would threaten the nascent recovery in commercial real estate. The improvement of certain economic factors, such as unemployment and real estate asset values and rents, has continued to lag behind the overall economy, or not occur at all. These economic factors typically affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial services, more significantly. To illustrate this point, improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by 12 to 18 months. Our clients include entities active in these industries. Furthermore, financial services companies with a substantial lending business, like ours, are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans. Should unemployment or real estate asset values fail to recover for an extended period of time, or fundamentals deteriorate as a result of further decline in asset values and the instability of rental income, it could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Declining asset prices could adversely affect us.  During the recession from December 2007 to June 2009, the volatility and disruption that the capital and credit markets experienced reached extreme levels. The severe market dislocations in 2008 led to the failure of several substantial financial institutions, causing widespread liquidation of assets and further constraining of the credit    22     markets. These asset sales, along with asset sales by other leveraged investors, including some hedge funds, rapidly drove down prices and valuations across a wide variety of traded asset classes. Asset price deterioration has a negative effect on the valuation of many of the asset categories represented on our balance sheet, and reduces our ability to sell assets at prices we deem acceptable. For example, a further recession would likely reverse recent positive trends in asset prices. These factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Various factors may cause our allowance for loan and lease losses to increase.  We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense, that represents our estimate of losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance is necessary to reserve for estimated loan and lease losses and risks incurred in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations, specific credit risks, loan and lease loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, and incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a degree of subjectivity and requires that we make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, the stagnation of certain economic indicators that we are more susceptible to, such as unemployment and real estate values, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that can differ somewhat from those of our own management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses (i.e., if the loan and lease allowance is inadequate), we will need additional loan and lease loss provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses. Should such additional provisions become necessary, they would result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  We are subject to credit risk, in the form of changes in interest rates, changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate, and/or changes in the financial condition of our counterparties, which changes could adversely affect us.  There are inherent risks associated with our lending and trading activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate. Increases in interest rates and/or further weakening of economic conditions caused by another recession or otherwise could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans.  As of December 31, 2012, approximately 70% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, commercial real estate loans, including commercial mortgage and construction loans, and commercial leases. These types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans.  We also do business with environmentally sensitive industries and in connection with the development of Brownfield sites that provide appropriate business opportunities. We monitor and evaluate our borrowers for compliance with environmental-related covenants, which include covenants requiring compliance with applicable law. Should political or other changes make it difficult for certain of our customers to maintain compliance with applicable covenants, our credit quality could be adversely affected. The deterioration of a larger loan or a group of our loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, which could result in net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the Provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, any of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  In addition, many of our routine transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held cannot be realized upon or is    23     liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Additionally, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us. The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.  Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties in the financial services industries, and we routinely execute transactions with such counterparties, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Financial services institutions, however, are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by one or more financial services institutions have led to, and may cause, market-wide liquidity problems and losses. Many of our transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us. Any such losses could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  IV. Capital and Liquidity Risks  Capital requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, together with new capital and liquidity standards adopted by the Basel Committee, will result in banks and BHCs needing to maintain more and higher quality capital than has historically been the case.  New and evolving capital standards, both as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementation of new capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee, including “Basel III”, will have a significant impact on banks and BHCs, including Key. For a detailed explanation of Basel III and possible revisions to current capital rules, see the sections titled “Supervision and Regulation” and “Capital.”  The full effect of the Federal Reserve’s possible revisions to the Basel III liquidity standards on Key is uncertain at this time. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital as well as greater liquidity going forward could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. In addition, the new liquidity standards could require us to increase our holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing our ability to invest in longer-term assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective.  In addition, the Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies to obtain approval before making a “capital distribution,” such as paying or increasing dividends, implementing common stock repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. The Federal Reserve has set forth the processes that bank holding companies should have in place to ensure they hold adequate capital under adverse conditions to maintain ready access to funding before engaging in any of these activities. These rules could limit Key’s ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. See “Supervision and Regulation —” in Item 1 of this Report  There can be no assurance that the legislation and other initiatives undertaken by the United States government will continue to support increased stability in the U.S. financial system.  Since 2008, the federal government has intervened in an unprecedented manner in an effort to provide stability and liquidity to the financial markets. The Federal Reserve is currently maintaining a variety of monetary policy measures to stabilize the economy; these policy measures have been maintained by the FOMC over the last few years as economic growth, unemployment and inflation have not been at levels mandated for the FOMC to achieve.    24    Market liquidity issues have been alleviated somewhat, but U.S. growth still lags levels mandated for the FOMC to achieve, and the U.S. economy remains vulnerable. In addition, while the situation in Europe has stabilized somewhat, the region’s recession and ongoing fiscal challenges remain important risks to the U.S. economy. There can be no assurance regarding the actual impact that these government initiatives will have on the financial markets. The failure of the U.S. government programs to sufficiently contribute to financial market stability and put the U.S. economy on a stable path for an economic recovery could result in a worsening of current financial market conditions, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us. In the event that any of the various forms of turmoil experienced in the financial markets return or become exacerbated, there may be a Material Adverse Effect on Us from (i) continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets, (ii) continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our transaction counterparties specifically, (iii) limitations resulting from further governmental action to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system, or (iv) further recessionary conditions.  We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our funds.  We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. With the exception of cash raised from debt and equity issuances, we receive substantially all of our cash flow from dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our equity securities and interest and principal on our debt. Federal banking law and regulations limit the amount of dividends that KeyBank (KeyCorp’s largest subsidiary) can pay. For further information on the regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by KeyBank, see “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1 of this report.  In the event KeyBank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our equity securities. Our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. The inability to receive dividends from KeyBank could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Our credit ratings affect our liquidity position.  Our rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of KeyCorp and KeyBank, and their ratings of our long-term debt and other securities are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength, ability to generate earnings, and other factors, some of which are not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry, the financial markets and the economy, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings.  On October 18, 2012, S&P maintained its “Positive” outlook rating for each of KeyCorp and KeyBank. S&P’s ratings for KeyCorp’s short-term borrowings and senior long-term debt are A-2 and BBB+, respectively, and KeyBank’s short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt and subordinated debt are rated A-2, A-, and BBB+, respectively.  In light of the various changes in the ratings methodologies underway as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. If the securities of KeyCorp and/or KeyBank suffer ratings downgrades, such downgrades could adversely affect our access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us, thereby reducing our ability to generate income. Downgrades of the credit ratings of securities, particularly if they are below investment-grade, could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  We are subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect our funding levels.  Market conditions or other events could negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.    25     Although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions, any substantial, unexpected and/or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us. Certain credit markets that we participate in and rely upon as sources of funding were significantly disrupted and volatile from the third quarter of 2007 through the third quarter of 2009. Credit markets have improved since then, and we have significantly reduced our reliance on wholesale funding sources. Part of our strategy to reduce liquidity risk involves promoting customer deposit growth, exiting certain noncore lending businesses, diversifying our funding base, maintaining a liquid asset portfolio, and strengthening our capital base to reduce our need for debt as a source of liquidity. Many of these disrupted markets have shown signs of recovery throughout 2012. Nonetheless, if further market disruption or other factors reduce the cost effectiveness and/or the availability of supply in the credit markets for a prolonged period of time, should our funding needs necessitate it, we may need to expand our use of other potential means of accessing funding and managing liquidity such as generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings, purchasing deposits from other banks, borrowing under certain secured wholesale facilities, and utilizing relationships developed with fixed income investors in a variety of markets, as well as increased management of loan growth and investment opportunities and other management tools. There can be no assurance that these alternative means of funding will be available; under certain stressed conditions experienced in the liquidity crisis during 2007-2009, some of these alternative means of funding were not available. Should these forms of funding become unavailable, it could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  V. Operational Risks  We may not realize the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives.  Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including among others, our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives. Our strategic priorities include growing revenue and reducing expenses through targeted investments, technology enhancements and streamlining our operations. As part of our efficiency initiative, we have committed to achieving an annual expense run rate reduction of $150 to $200 million by December 2013 and a cash efficiency ratio in the target range of 60% to 65% by the first quarter of 2014. There may be unanticipated difficulties in implementing our efficiency initiative, and there can be no assurance that we will ultimately realize the full benefits of, or be able to sustain the annual cost savings anticipated by, our efficiency initiative. Our inability to achieve the anticipated outcomes of our stated strategies may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability. Our strategic priorities also include developing, maintaining and building long-term customer relationships based on quality service and competitive prices. Our failure to execute our strategic initiatives relating to any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position and have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  We are subject to operational risk.  We are subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk includes the risk of fraud by employees, clerical and record-keeping errors, nonperformance by vendors, threats to cybersecurity, and computer/telecommunications malfunctions. Operational risk also encompasses compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of our noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business, such as certain loan processing functions. For example, break-downs or failures of our vendors’ systems or employees could be a source of operational risk to us. Additionally, some of our outsourcing arrangements are located overseas and, therefore, are subject to political risks unique to the regions in which they operate.    26    Resulting losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, inability to secure insurance, litigation, regulatory intervention or sanctions or foregone business opportunities, any and all of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.  We regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. We also maintain an ERM program. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or a failure to establish appropriate controls or to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Our methods of reducing risk exposure might not be effective.  Instruments, systems and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance, credit, liquidity, operational and business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, we may not be able to effectively mitigate our risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.  We rely heavily on communications, information systems (both internal and provided by third parties) and the internet to conduct our business. Our business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal, regulatory and internal standards and specifications. In addition, a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal and confidential information, such as the personal information of our customers and clients. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.  While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a possible failure, interruption or breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that such action will not occur or, if any does occur, that it will be adequately addressed. For example, although we maintain commercially reasonable measures to ensure the cybersecurity of our information systems, other financial service institutions and companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems. In addition, several U.S. financial institutions, including Key, have recently experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems. Other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. To date, none of these efforts has had a material effect on our business or operations. Such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. Although we have adjusted our cybersecurity program to anticipate that a breach is more likely and have placed a greater focus on detection and incident response, our security systems may not be able to protect our information systems from similar attacks due to the rapid evolution and creation of sophisticated cyberattacks. We are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action and reputational harm.    27    We are also increasingly reliant on third party service providers to perform significant operational services on our behalf. These third party providers are subject to the same risks relating to cybersecurity, break-downs or failures of their own systems or employees. While we make every effort to mitigate these risks through specific contractual obligations relating to security and strong oversight of these service providers, there can be no assurance that one or more of our third party service providers will not experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, that it will be adequately addressed.  Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those of our third party service providers could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our offerings of mobile payments and other internet or web-based products. Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, a disruptive event impacting the infrastructure that supports our business, such as a failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, could adversely affect our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  We are subject to claims and litigation.  From time to time, customers, vendors or other parties may make claims and take legal actions against us. We maintain reserves for certain claims when deemed appropriate based upon our assessment that a loss is probable, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. At any given time we have a variety of legal actions asserted against us in various stages of litigation. Resolution of a legal action can often take years. Whether any particular claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect how the market perceives us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services.  We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business, including, among other things, accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. The number and risk of these investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry due to legal changes to the consumer protection laws provided for by the Dodd-Frank Act, the creation of the CFPB, and the uncertainty as to whether federal preemption of certain state consumer laws remains intact for federally chartered financial institutions like KeyBank and KeyCorp. A weakening of federal pre-emption would potentially increase our compliance and operational costs and risks since we are a national bank with multi-state operations and customers and we would potentially face state and local enforcement activity.  There have also been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.  Any financial liability for which we have not adequately maintained reserves, and/or any damage to our reputation from such claims and legal actions, could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.  Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although we    28     have established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitor for significant environmental effects on our properties or our investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  VI. Strategic and Reputation Risks  We operate in a highly competitive industry.  We face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national and super-regional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment management firms, investment banking firms, broker-dealers and other local, regional and national financial services firms. In recent years, competition has intensified due to substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry, a trend that may continue. The competitive landscape was also affected by the liquidity crisis, which led to the conversion of traditional investment banks to bank holding companies due to the access it provides to government-sponsored sources of liquidity. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. We expect the competitive landscape of the financial services industry to become even more intensified as a result of legislative, regulatory, structural and technological changes.  Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among others, our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives; developing, maintaining and building long-term customer relationships based on quality service, competitive prices, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; and industry and general economic trends. Increased competition in the financial services industry, and our failure to perform in any of these areas, could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability and have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.  Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we are engaged can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want and/or need. To attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate such employees at market levels. Typically, those levels have caused employee compensation to be our greatest expense.  Various restrictions on compensation of certain executive officers were imposed under the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation and regulations. In addition, our incentive compensation structure is subject to review by the Federal Reserve, which may identify deficiencies in the structure, causing us to make changes that may affect our ability to offer competitive compensation to these individuals. Our ability to attract and retain talented employees may be affected by these developments, or any new executive compensation limits and regulations, and such restrictions could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Maintaining or increasing our market share may depend upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences, while maintaining competitive prices for our products and services.  The continuous, widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services and smart phones, requires us to evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services, as well as our distribution of them, to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. New technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks, while new services allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have    29     historically been held as bank deposits. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as “disintermediation,” could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and related income generated from those deposits.  The increasing pressure from our competitors, both bank and non-bank, to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services requires us to incur substantial expenditures. We may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products and services, modifying our existing products and services, adapting to changing consumer preferences and spending and saving habits, achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval, sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices lower than the prices offered by our competitors. These risks may affect our ability to achieve growth in our market share and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our revenues from our net interest margin and fee-based products and services, all factors which may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Our failure to effectively “cross-sell” our products and services to customers could have a negative effect on our revenue growth and financial results.  Selling more products or services to our customers, or “cross-selling”, is an integral part of our business model and is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings during the current period of slow economic growth and regulatory reform. Many of our competitors also focus on cross-selling, especially in retail banking and mortgage lending. This can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us to sell our products at lower prices, reducing our net interest income and revenue from our fee-based products. It could also affect our ability to retain our existing customers. As our competitors increase their cross-selling efforts and new technologies require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers, we may face difficulties in increasing our cross-selling ratio, or the average number of products sold to existing customers. Our failure to sell additional products or services to our existing or new customers who instead purchase such products from our competitors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses.  Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors and highly-skilled management and employees is impacted by our reputation. Public perception of the financial services industry declined since the recent downturn in the U.S. economy. We continue to face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn. Significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry can also significantly adversely affect our reputation. We could also suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with us, which could adversely affect our businesses.  Our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues gives rise to reputational risk that could cause significant harm to us and our business prospects, and may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including:        •    potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;      •    exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;    30                •    difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;      •    potential disruption to our business;      •    potential diversion of our management’s time and attention;      •    the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company;      •    difficulty in estimating the value (i.e., the assets and liabilities) of the target company;      •    difficulty in estimating the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and derivatives of the target company; and      •    potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  We regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per Common Share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  VII. Risks to Our Common Shares  An investment in our Common Shares is not an insured deposit.  Our Common Shares are not a bank deposit and, therefore, are not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our Common Shares is inherently risky for the reasons described in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common shares in any company. As a result, if you acquire our Common Shares, you may lose some or all of your investment.  Our articles of incorporation and regulations, as well as certain banking laws, may have an anti-takeover effect.  Provisions of our articles of incorporation and regulations and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Shares.      ITEM 1B.
