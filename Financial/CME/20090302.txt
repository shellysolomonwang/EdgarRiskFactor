ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business.  Risks Relating to Our Business  There can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation and stimulus programs will help stabilize the U.S. financial system.  In light of the current financial crisis, legislation has been enacted, including the the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the President’s economic stimulus program, and additional legislation has been proposed for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets and improving the overall economy. There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that this legislation will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced. The government investment in financial services firms could also lead to new regulations and governmental oversight. The failure of these regulations to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions or the imposition of additional regulations in the financial services industry could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our Class A common stock.  Current levels of the capital and credit market volatility are unprecedented.  The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 12 months. During this period, the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital, including future commercial paper issuances, and on our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to pay off our fixed and floating rate notes as they become due.  Current market developments may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.  We generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees. Declines in trading volumes and market liquidity would adversely affect our business and financial condition. During 2008 and 2009, the global financial services industry and securities markets have experienced significant and adverse conditions, including significantly increased volatility, outflows of customer funds and securities, losses resulting from declining asset values, defaults on securities and reduced liquidity. As a result, many financial institutions have required additional capital infusions, merged with larger and stronger institutions, become bank holding companies that are regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank and, in some cases, have failed. As a result of this instability of the financial markets and the lack of readily available credit, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other of our customers have already decreased and could in the future further decrease their risk exposure and trading volume. This circumstance has resulted in a decrease in the trading of our benchmark interest rate products. In addition, interest rates have stabilized at low levels and we have experienced a decreased demand to hedge interest rate exposure using our markets. For example, the average daily volume for CME Eurodollar options decreased by 27% to 0.9 million contracts per day in 2008 when compared with 2007. Overall, average daily volume for our entire interest rate product line was down compared with 2007. If our customers further reduce their level of trading activity for any reason, including a reduction in the number of traders, reduced trading demand by their customers or a decision to curtail or cease speculative trading, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.    25    Table of Contents Current trends in the global financial markets could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price.   Stock markets in general, and stock prices of participants in the financial services industry in particular, including us, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for securities. The market price of our Class A common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations which may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and increased volatility could result in a further decline in the market price of our Class A common stock. Factors that could significantly impact the volatility of our stock price include:        •    developments in our business or in the financial sector generally, including the effect of direct governmental action in financial markets generally and with respect to futures exchanges in particular;        •    regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;        •    the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;        •    changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or asset valuations or volatility;        •    operating results that may be worse than the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors; and        •    market developments that affect our customers causing a decrease in the use of our products.  Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets.  Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital.  Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service obligations. We may still be able to incur more debt, intensifying these risks.  As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $3.2 billion of total indebtedness. Additionally, on February 9, 2009, we issued an additional $750 million of unsecured notes at an interest rate of 5.75% due 2014. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding commercial paper borrowings backstopped by our $1.3 billion 364-day revolving bridge facility and subsequently terminated the bridge facility. After the termination of the bridge facility, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately $0.2 billion.  Our indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, our indebtedness may:        •    require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;        •    increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions;        •    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry;        •    place us at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors; and        •    subject us to interest rate exposure for our variable interest rate debt, to the extent not hedged.  The occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. In addition, the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness do not significantly limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks described above.    26    Table of Contents Our investment in BM&F subjects us to investment and currency risk.  We own an interest in BM&F representing approximately 5%. As an exchange, BM&F’s ability to maintain or expand their trading volume and operate their business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we took a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $275 million on our cross-equity investment in BM&F, due to the decline in BM&F’s stock price relative to our original investment. In connection with this charge, we also reduced stockholder’s equity by $94 million due to unfavorable movements in the Brazilian real compared with the U.S. dollar because BM&F’s stock is valued in Brazilian real. To mitigate our financial exposure to the currency risk of the investment, we purchased an option to hedge against fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real with Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., our hedging arrangement was terminated and our currency exposure is no longer mitigated. There is no guarantee that our investment in BM&F will be profitable. Under the terms of the transaction, we may not sell our shares in BM&F until February 2012.  Any impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets or investments may result in material, non-cash write downs and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders’ equity.  In connection with our acquisitions, including our mergers with CBOT Holdings and NYMEX Holdings, we have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We assess goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by applying a fair-value based test looking at historical performance, capital requirements and projected cash flows on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In the fourth-quarter 2008, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of $275 million on our cross-equity investment in BM&F and, in connection with this charge, we reduced stockholder’s equity by $94 million due to unfavorable movements in the Brazilian real compared with the U.S. dollar. In the third-quarter 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $15 million relating to our Swapstream acquisition. Although we did not experience any other events or circumstances in the year that indicated that the carrying amounts of our other intangible assets and goodwill were impaired, we could experience future events that result in impairments. The risk of impairment losses may increase to the extent our market capitalization and earnings decline. For example, during 2008, we experienced a significant decline in our stock price. While we believe this decline was principally driven by external circumstances, such as the decline in the stock market overall, and is not necessarily a reflection of changes in our business model, a continued decline in our stock value would be a factor in future assessments whether due to external factors and/or a continued decline in our volumes. An impairment of the value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under our existing or future debt agreements.  Shareholders who own trading rights or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchanges account for 20 of the 33 directors on our board. These shareholders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of shareholders who are not also members. Our dependence on the trading and clearing activities of our members, combined with their rights to elect directors, may enable them to exert substantial influence over the operation of our business.  Twenty of our 33 directors on our board own or are officers or directors of firms who own trading rights on our exchange. We are dependent on the revenues from the trading and clearing activities of our members. This dependence may give them substantial influence over how we operate our business.  Many of our members and clearing firms derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading or clearing activities on or through our exchanges. In addition, trading rights on our exchanges have substantial independent value. The amount of income that members derive from their trading, brokering and clearing activities and the value of their trading rights are, in part, dependent on the fees they are charged to trade, broker, clear and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock may not have the same economic interests as our members. In addition, our members may have differing interests among themselves depending on the role they serve in our markets, their method of trading and the products they trade. Consequently, members may advocate that we enhance and protect their clearing and trading opportunities and the value of their trading privileges over their economic interest in us.  The rights of our members, including the board representation rights of the members of our CME exchange to elect six directors and the rights described in the immediately following risk factor, could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed, including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance shareholder value.    27    Table of Contents Our members have been granted special rights, which protect their trading privileges, require that we maintain open outcry trading until volumes are not significant and, in the case of our Class B shareholders, provide them with special board representation.  Under the terms of the organizational documents of our exchanges, our members have certain rights that relate primarily to trading right protections, certain trading fee protections and certain membership benefit protections. Additionally, our Class B shareholders, who are members of our CME exchange, are also entitled to elect six of the 33 directors on our board; even if their Class A share ownership interest is very small or non-existent. In connection with these rights, our ability to take certain actions that we may deem to be in the best interests of the company and its shareholders, including actions relating to the operation of our open outcry trading facilities and certain pricing decisions, may be limited by the rights of our members.  Our business is subject to the impact of domestic and international market and economic conditions, which are beyond our control and which could significantly reduce our trading volumes and make our financial results more volatile.  Our revenue is substantially dependent on the trading volume in our markets. Our trading volume is directly affected by U.S. domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including the factors described in the preceding risk factor as well as:        •    economic, political and geopolitical market conditions;        •    natural disasters and other catastrophes;        •    broad trends in industry and finance;        •    changes in price levels and volatility in the derivatives markets and in underlying fixed-income, equity, foreign exchange and commodity markets;        •    legislative and regulatory changes;        •    competition;        •    changes in government monetary policies;        •    consolidation in our customer base and within our industry; and        •    inflation.  Any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity in our markets. Historically, our trading volume has tended to increase during periods of uncertainty due to increased hedging activity and needs to manage the risks associated with or speculate on volatility in the U.S. equity markets, fluctuations in interest rates and price changes in the foreign exchange, commodity and other markets. However, during the current economic volatility, we have experienced decreased volume due primarily to our customers decreasing their risk exposure, stable low interest rates and the lack of available capital. Recent events in the economic environment, including the sub-prime lending crisis, the downturn in the housing market, decreases in consumer spending and the failure of major financial institutions have resulted in an economic recession. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful. This trend as well as future economic uncertainty may result in continued decreased trading volume and a more difficult business environment for us. Material decreases in trading volume would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.  Our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to seasonality. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.  Generally, we have historically experienced relatively higher trading volume during the first and second quarters and sequentially lower trading volume in the third and fourth quarters. As a result of this seasonality, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance. If we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially.    28    Table of Contents Our average rate per contract is subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract.  Our average rate per contract, which impacts our operating results, is subject to fluctuation due to shifts in the mix of products traded, the trading venue and the mix of customers (whether the customer receives member or non-member fees or participates in one of our various incentive programs) and the impact of our tiered pricing structure. For example, we earn a higher rate per contract for trades executed electronically. In addition, our members and participants in our various incentive programs generally are charged lower fees than our non-member customers. Variation in each of these factors is difficult to predict and will have an impact on our average rate per contract in the particular period. Because of this fluctuation, you may not be able to rely on our average rate per contract in any particular period as an indication of our future average rate per contract. If we fail to meet securities analysts’ expectations regarding our operating results, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially.  Our cost structure is largely fixed. If our revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs, our profitability will be adversely affected.  Our cost structure is largely fixed. We base our cost structure on historical and expected levels of demand for our products and services. If demand for our products and services and our resulting revenues decline, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis. In that event, our profitability will be adversely affected.  The success of our markets will depend on our ability to complete development of and successfully implement electronic trading systems that have the functionality, performance, reliability and speed required by our customers.  The future success of our business depends in large part on our ability to create interactive electronic marketplaces in a wide range of derivatives products that have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed to attract and retain customers. A significant portion of our current overall volume is generated through electronic trading on our CME Globex electronic platform.  We must continue to enhance our electronic trading platform to remain competitive. As a result, we will continue to be subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties encountered in the rapidly evolving market for electronic transaction services. These risks include our failure or inability to:        •    provide reliable and cost-effective services to our customers;        •    develop, in a timely manner, the required functionality to support electronic trading in our key products in a manner that is competitive with the functionality supported by other electronic markets;        •    match fees of our competitors that offer only electronic trading facilities;        •    attract independent software vendors to write front-end software that will effectively access our electronic trading system and automated order routing system;        •    respond to technological developments or service offerings by competitors; and        •    generate sufficient revenue to justify the substantial capital investment we have made and will continue to make to enhance our electronic trading platform.  If we do not successfully enhance our electronic trading platform, or our current or potential customers do not accept it, our revenues and profits will be adversely affected.  In addition, if we are unable to develop our electronic trading systems to include other products and markets, or if our electronic trading systems do not have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed, we may not be able to compete successfully in an environment that is increasingly dominated by electronic trading.    29    Table of Contents If we experience systems failures or capacity constraints, our ability to conduct our operations and execute our business strategy could be materially harmed and we could be subjected to significant costs and liabilities.  We are heavily dependent on the capacity, reliability and security of the computer and communications systems and software supporting our operations. We receive and/or process a large portion of our trade orders through electronic means, such as through public and private communications networks. Our systems, or those of our third party providers, may fail or operate slowly, causing one or more of the following to occur:        •    unanticipated disruptions in service to our customers;        •    slower response times;        •    delays in our customers’ trade execution;        •    failed settlement of trades;        •    incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades;        •    financial losses;        •    security breaches;        •    litigation or other customer claims;        •    loss of customers; and        •    regulatory sanctions.  We cannot assure you that we will not experience systems failures from power or telecommunications failure, acts of God, war or terrorism, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, acts of vandalism or similar events. If any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled, including as a result of system failure, employee or customer error or misuse of our systems, we could suffer financial loss, liability to customers, regulatory intervention or reputational damage that could affect demand by current and potential users of our market.  From time to time, we have experienced system errors and failures that have resulted in some customers being unable to connect to our electronic trading platform or erroneous reporting, such as transactions that were not authorized by any customer or reporting of filled orders as cancelled. For example, we have experienced technical failures that resulted in a temporary suspension of trading on the CME Globex platform. We cannot assure you that if we experience system errors or failures in the future that they will not have a material impact on our business. Any such system failures that cause an interruption in service or decrease our responsiveness could impair our reputation, damage our brand name or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  Our status as a CFTC registrant generally requires that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume. Heavy use of our computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time. We constantly monitor system loads and performance and regularly implement system upgrades to handle estimated increases in trading volume. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volume and order messaging traffic will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volume and order messaging traffic without failure or degradation of performance. Increased CME Globex trading volume and order messaging traffic may result in connectivity problems or erroneous reports that may affect users of the platform. System failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations, to file lawsuits against us or to cease doing business with us or could lead the CFTC or other regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations.  We will need to continue to upgrade, expand and increase the capacity of our systems as our business grows and we execute our business strategy. Generally, our goal is to design our systems to handle at least one and a half times our peak historical transactions in our highest volume products. As volumes of transactions grow, the ability of our systems to meet this goal on an ongoing basis depends on our ability to increase our system capacity on a timely basis while maintaining system reliability. Although many of our systems are designed to accommodate additional volume and products and services without redesign or replacement, we will need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate the increases in volume of transactions and order transaction traffic and to provide processing services to third parties. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be adversely affected.    30    Table of Contents We face intense competition from other companies, including some of our members. If we are not able to successfully compete, our business will not survive.  The derivatives, securities and financial services industries are highly competitive. We expect that competition will continue to intensify. Our current and prospective competitors, both domestically and around the world, are numerous. They include securities and securities option exchanges, futures exchanges, over-the-counter markets, clearing organizations, market data and information vendors, electronic communications networks, crossing systems and similar entities, consortia of large customers, consortia of some of our clearing firms and electronic brokerage and dealing facilities. The global derivatives industry has grown increasingly competitive. Exchanges, intermediaries, and even end users are consolidating, and over-the-counter and unregulated entities are constantly evolving. Additionally, in response to growing competition, many marketplaces in both Europe and the United States have demutualized to provide greater flexibility for future growth. In 2007, we completed our merger with CBOT Holdings, NYSE Group completed its merger with Euronext and ICE acquired the New York Board of Trade and the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. In 2008, we completed our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings. ICE also has a pending agreement to acquire the Clearing Corp., an independent clearing house owned by large derivatives dealers. In the last two years there has been a significant increase in activity among derivative dealers, banks and other entities to form competing exchanges. In 2007, a consortium of 12 financial institutions formed an exchange, ELX, to enter the futures market, initially listing interest rate products. In November 2008, ELX filed an application with the CFTC for designation as a contract market. ELX is expected to become operational following receipt of regulatory approval. Additionally, other financial firms have invested in a number of projects in an effort to compete with existing futures exchanges, including Project Four Seasons and Turquoise. These entrants into our industry may increase competitive pressure on us.  We believe we may also face competition from large computer software companies and media and technology companies. The number of businesses providing internet-related financial services is rapidly growing. Other companies have entered into or are forming joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us. Others may become competitive with us through acquisitions. Federal law allows institutions that have been major participants on our exchange to trade the same or similar products among themselves without utilizing any exchange or trading system. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar products, to provide lower transaction costs and better execution to their customers and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than we can. In addition, our competitors may:        •    respond more quickly to competitive pressures, including responses based upon their corporate governance structures, which may be more flexible and efficient than our corporate governance structure;        •    develop products that are preferred by our customers;        •    develop risk transfer products that compete with our products;        •    price their products and services more competitively;        •    develop and expand their network infrastructure and service offerings more efficiently;        •    utilize better, more user-friendly and more reliable technology;        •    take greater advantage of acquisitions, alliances and other opportunities;        •    more effectively market, promote and sell their products and services;        •    better leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners or exploit better recognized brand names to market and sell their services; and        •    exploit regulatory disparities between traditional, regulated exchanges and alternative markets that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model.  If our products, markets and services are not competitive, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed.  A decline in our fees or any loss of customers could lower our revenues, which would adversely affect our profitability.  Future changes in regulations as a result of the recent focus on the regulation of the financial industry in connection with the financial crisis, the combination of the SEC and the CFTC or otherwise, may adversely impact our ability to compete.    31    Table of Contents Our trading volume, and consequently our revenues and profits, would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our current customers or attract new customers to our exchange.  The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase our trading volume. To do so, we must maintain and expand our product offerings, our customer base and our trade execution alternatives. Our success also depends on our ability to maintain our trading volume and to offer competitive prices and services in an increasingly price sensitive business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product lines, or that we will be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers. The majority of the clearing and transaction fees we receive from our clearing firms represent charges for trades executed on behalf of their customers. We believe that in the event one of our clearing firms discontinues operations, the customer portion of that firm’s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm. However, we cannot guarantee you that the discontinuation of any clearing firm would not result in our loss of customers or a loss of trading volume as a result of the consolidation of trading accounts at the acquiring firm which could have an adverse effect on our trading volumes or revenues. We also cannot assure you that we will not lose customers to low-cost competitors with comparable or superior products, services or trade execution facilities. If we fail to maintain our trading volume, expand our product offerings or execution facilities, or we lose a substantial number of our current customers, or a subset of customers representing a significant percentage of trading volume in a particular product line; or are unable to attract new customers, our business will be adversely affected. Furthermore, declines in trading volume due to loss of customers may negatively impact market liquidity, which could lead to further loss of trading volume.  Any significant decline in the trading volume of our Eurodollar or S&P 500 futures and options on futures contracts would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  We are substantially dependent on trading volume from two product offerings for a significant portion of our clearing and transaction fee revenues and profits. The clearing and transaction fees revenue attributable to transactions in Eurodollar contracts and all our contracts based on the S&P 500 (including E-mini products) approximated 18% and 24%, respectively, of our total clearing and transaction fees revenue during the year ended December 31, 2008 and 32% and 24%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2007. Any significant decline in our trading volume in either of these products would negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.  Our Eurodollar futures and options on futures reflect LIBOR for a 3-month, $1 million offshore deposit maturing at some point in the future. The accuracy of LIBOR rates has come under scrutiny in recent months due to discrepancies in the borrowing costs in the currency forwards market and the rates reported by the British Bankers Association. As a result of this inconsistency, interest rate markets continue to reflect dislocations between Eurodollar and overnight rates. For example, in December 31, 2008, the average daily trading volume of our Eurodollar options contract was down 27% compared with 2007. The trading volumes of our Eurodollar contract may continue to be negatively impacted to the extent that LIBOR continues to be scrutinized.  We also cannot assure you that competitors will not enter the Eurodollar market. Our members may also elect to trade Eurodollars in privately negotiated bilateral transactions without the use of our clearing house. In either of these events, our trading volume, revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.  Our license agreement with S&P provides that the S&P 500 Index futures products will be exclusive through December 31, 2016 so long as certain minimum average trading volume is met or other circumstances exist that relate to the reduction in trading volume.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the exclusivity of our licensing agreement with S&P. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not succeed in creating stock index futures based on information similar to that which we have obtained by license or that market participants will not increasingly use other instruments, including securities and options based on the S&P indexes, to manage or speculate on U.S. stock risks. Parties may also succeed in offering indexed products that are similar to our licensed products without being required to obtain a license or in countries that are beyond the jurisdictional reach of us and/or our licensors.  Our clearing house operations expose us to substantial credit risk of third parties and the soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us.  CME, our subsidiary, owns and operates its own clearing house, which acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our futures exchanges or on third-party exchanges for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional customers. As a result of the recent financial crisis, many financial institutions have required additional capital infusions, merged with larger and stronger institutions, become bank holding companies that are regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank and, in some cases, have failed. For example, during 2008, The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International Group, Inc., all of which were parent companies of clearing firms of our exchange, have experienced significant financial write-downs and in some cases failed. Although none of these cases resulted in a default of a clearing firm, additional companies, including our clearing firms, may encounter economic difficulties as a result of the market turmoil and the tightening of the credit market.    32    Table of Contents As part of our overall growth initiatives we are expanding our clearing services to the over-the-counter market in addition to standard futures and options on futures products, including through CME ClearPort and as a result of our proposed joint venture with Citadel to clear credit default swaps. The process for deriving margins and performance bonds for over-the-counter products is different and, in part, seeks to assess and capture different risks than our historical practices applied to our futures products. Although we believe that we have carefully analyzed the process for setting our financial safeguards for over-the-counter products, there is no guarantee that our risk management procedures will adequately protect us from the unique risks of these products as we have not historically provided clearing services to this market.  A substantial part of our working capital is at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearing house and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.  The required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market.  To become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds with our clearing house as collateral for their trading activity. The funds used to satisfy these requirements may be cash or held in a variety of investments, such as regulated money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities and asset-backed securities. Given the level of market volatility, there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value. To the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements, it would be required to acquire additional funds, decrease its proprietary trading activity and/or transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm. These actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products.  A key element of our strategy is to provide transaction processing, clearing and related services to third parties. Our failure to identify future opportunities to provide these services will have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.  Providing third-party transaction processing, clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy. Pursuant to transaction-processing agreements we previously provided these services to NYMEX and to CBOT. Prior to our acquisition of these companies, we derived a significant amount of revenue from these services agreements. We have entered into other transaction-processing arrangements with BM&F, KRX and DME. We cannot assure you that such arrangements will be as profitable as our previous arrangements with NYMEX and CBOT or that we will enter into additional agreements to provide processing services in the future. Our failure to capitalize on our existing arrangement and to identify future opportunities may have a negative impact on our ability to generate additional revenues and grow our business.  Our market data fees may be reduced or eliminated by decreased demand or the growth of electronic trading and electronic order entry systems. If we are unable to offset that reduction through terminal usage fees or transaction fees, we will experience a reduction in revenue.  We sell our market data to individuals and organizations that use our markets or monitor general economic conditions. Revenues from our market data totaled $279.5 million, representing 11% of our total revenues, and $145.1 million, or 8% of our total revenues, during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A decrease in overall trading volume may also lead to a decreased demand for our market data from the market data vendors. For example, we believe that the decrease in the number of devices for CME and CBOT market data from approximately 293,000 at December 31, 2007 to approximately 290,000 at December 31, 2008 is due primarily to the consolidation of our customers and related headcount reductions as a result of the current financial crisis. Additionally, electronic trading systems do not usually impose separate charges for supplying market data to trading terminals. If we do not separately charge for market data supplied to trading terminals, and trading terminals with access to our markets become widely available, we could lose market data fees from those who have access to trading terminals. We will experience a reduction in our revenues if we are unable to recover that lost market data revenue through terminal usage fees or transaction fees.    33    Table of Contents We operate in a heavily regulated environment that imposes significant costs and competitive burdens on our business.  Although the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 significantly reduced our regulatory burdens, we remain extensively regulated by the CFTC. In light of the widespread financial and economic difficulties, particularly acute in the latter half of 2008 and early 2009, there have been many calls for a restructuring of the regulation of financial markets. In light of the transition to a new Presidential administration, these new proposals as well as previous proposals calling for the merger of the CFTC and the SEC, such as the Department of Treasury’s Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure, we cannot predict what a restructured regulatory framework will look like or what impact it may have on our business. The President’s appointee to lead the CFTC has recently called for more regulation of futures markets and expressed concern respecting the impact of speculation on price volatility. Draft bills circulating in Congress call for restrictions on speculative trading by means of hard position limits in all contracts and limitations on hedge exemptions that could affect trading volume. In addition, future regulations could limit speculation in our markets or include a more rules-based approach rather than our current principles-based approach under the CFTC regulatory regime. To the extent the regulatory environment is less beneficial for us, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.  The CFTC has broad powers to investigate and enforce compliance and punish non-compliance with its rules and regulations. We cannot assure you that we and/or our directors, officers, employees and affiliates will be able to fully comply with these rules and regulations. We also cannot assure you that we will not be subject to claims or actions by the CFTC or other agencies. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of our business, removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our designations as a contract market and derivatives clearing organization.  Our international operations may be subject to similar regulations in specific jurisdictions. We are registered in a number of countries outside the United States. In some cases, our registrations are subject to annual review and such reviews may subject us to additional requirements in the future. We may also be required to register or become subject to regulation in other jurisdictions in order to accept business from customers in those jurisdictions.  Also, from time to time, the President’s budget includes a proposal that a transaction tax be imposed on futures and options on futures transactions. Additionally, recently proposed legislation has included a tax on certain transactions in an effort to generate additional funding to support the costs of the recently enacted economic stimulus package. While those proposals have not been adopted to date, except for a limited per-contract fee on single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the imposition of any such tax would increase the cost of using our products and, consequently, could adversely impact our trading volumes, revenues and profits. We cannot assure you that such a tax will not be imposed in the future.  Some of our largest clearing firms have indicated their belief that clearing facilities should not be owned or controlled by exchanges and should be operated as utilities and not for profit. These clearing firms have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes that would, if adopted, enable them to use alternative clearing services for positions established on our exchanges. Even if they are not successful, these factors may cause them to limit the use of our markets.  Some of our largest clearing firms, which are significant customers and intermediaries in our products, have stressed the importance to them of centralizing clearing of futures contracts and options on futures contracts in order to maximize the efficient use of their capital, exercise greater control over their value at risk and extract greater operating leverage from clearing activities. Many clearing firms have expressed the view that clearing firms should control the governance of clearing houses or that clearing houses should be operated as utilities rather than as part of for-profit enterprises. Some of these firms, along with the Futures Industry Association and the U.S. Department of Treasury, have sought, and may seek in the future, legislative or regulatory changes to be adopted that would facilitate mechanisms or policies that allow market participants to transfer positions from an exchange-owned clearing house to a clearing house owned and controlled by clearing firms. Our strategic business plan is to operate a vertically integrated transaction execution, clearing and settlement business for our futures and options on futures business. If these legislative or regulatory changes are adopted, our strategy and business plan may lead clearing firms to establish, or seek to use, alternative clearing houses for clearing positions established on our exchanges. Even if they are not successful in their efforts, the factors described above may cause clearing firms to limit or stop the use of our products and markets. If any of these events occur, our revenues and profits would be adversely affected.    34    Table of Contents The imposition in the future of regulations requiring that clearing houses establish linkages with other clearing houses whereby positions at one clearing house can be transferred to and maintained at, or otherwise offset by a fungible position existing at, another clearing house may have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business.  In connection with the trading of single stock futures and futures on narrow-based stock indexes, the CFMA contemplates that, once certain market penetration thresholds are crossed, clearing houses will establish linkages enabling a position in any such product executed on an exchange for which it clears these products to be offset by an economically linked or fungible position on the opposite side of the market that is executed on another exchange utilizing a different clearing house. If, in the future, a similar requirement is imposed with respect to futures contracts generally, the resulting unbundling of trade execution and clearing services would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits.  We, as well as many of our customers, depend on third party suppliers and service providers for a number of services that are important. An interruption or cessation of an important supply or service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business, including revenues derived from our customers’ trading activity.  We depend on a number of suppliers, such as banking, clearing and settlement organizations, telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, and software and hardware vendors for elements of our trading, clearing and other systems, as well as communications and networking equipment, computer hardware and software and related support and maintenance.  Many of our customers rely on third parties to provide them with front-end systems to access our CME Globex platform, such as independent software vendors. While these third parties are committed to keeping current with our enhancements and changes to our interfaces and functionality, we cannot guarantee that these third parties will continue to make the necessary monetary and time investments to keep up with our changes. In the event that these software programs do not interact with our platform seamlessly, our customers could be impacted which could lead to a decrease in trading volume.  To the extent any of our service providers or the organizations that provide services to our customers in connection with their trading activities cease to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner or fail to adequately expand their services to meet our needs, we could experience decreased trading volume, lower revenues and higher costs.  Our networks and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks, which could result in wrongful use of our information or cause interruptions in our operations that cause us to lose customers and trading volume and result in significant liabilities. We could also be required to incur significant expense to protect our systems.  We expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations. Our networks and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems. Persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Any of these events could cause us to lose customers or trading volume. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by breaches. Although we intend to continue to implement security measures, these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could cause us to lose customers, experience lower trading volume and incur significant liabilities.  Our compliance and risk management methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.  Generally, the CFTC has broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses or suspend or revoke our designation as a contract market or the registration of any of our officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations. Our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. We face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity. In the case of non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil lawsuits, including by customers, for damages, which can be significant. Any of these outcomes would adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. In extreme cases, these outcomes could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.    35    Table of Contents Our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage our risks may not be fully effective. Some of our risk management methods depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, financial, legal, regulatory and strategic risk requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events. We cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed.  We could be harmed by misconduct or errors that are difficult to detect and deter.  There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years. For example, in 2008 a mid-level trader at Societe Generale, engaged in unauthorized trading which cost Societe approximately $7 billion and a trader at MF Global, one our clearing firms, lost approximately $140 million in connection with unauthorized trades. Misconduct by our employees and agents, including employees of GFX, our wholly-owned subsidiary that engages primarily in proprietary trading in foreign exchange futures, could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. Misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Our employees and agents, including our GFX employees, also may commit errors that could subject us to financial claims for negligence, as well as regulatory actions.  As a financial services provider, we are subject to significant litigation risk and potential securities law liability.  Many aspects of our business involve substantial liability risks. While we enjoy governmental immunity for some of our market-related activities, we could be exposed to substantial liability under federal and state laws and court decisions, as well as rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC and the CFTC. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade, the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary losses to a customer, that we entered into an unauthorized transaction or that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction. Dissatisfied customers frequently make claims regarding quality of trade execution, improperly settled trades, mismanagement or even fraud against their service providers. We may become subject to these claims as a result of failures or malfunctions of our systems and services we provide. We could incur significant legal expenses defending claims, even those without merit. In addition, an adverse resolution of any future lawsuit or claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively.  We continue to focus on strategic initiatives to grow our business. For example, among our current growth initiatives is our goal to enter into the over-the-counter market. Some of our initiatives in this area are subject to additional regulatory approval, such as CFTC approval of new over-the-counter swap products and our pending exemption with the SEC relating to CMDX. There is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful. Continued growth will require additional investment in personnel, facilities, information technology infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls and may place a significant strain on our management and resources. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support our growth organically or, as described in the following risk factor, through acquisitions or other strategic alliances. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs (both hard and soft) associated with our growth, our future profitability could be adversely affected, and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address the additional operational and control requirements as a result of our growth.  Our acquisition, investment and alliance strategy involves risks. If we are unable to effectively manage these risks, our business will be materially harmed.  To achieve our strategic objectives, in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in other companies, businesses or technologies. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the following:        •    difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses or technologies;        •    diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;        •    assumption of unknown material liabilities;        •    difficulties in implementing adequate compliance and risk management methods for new operations;        •    failure to achieve financial or operating objectives;        •    potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired companies;        •    exposure to foreign currency, which exposure may or may not be hedged or partially hedged; and    36    Table of Contents     •    difficulties in receiving approval from governmental authorities.  We may not be able to integrate successfully any operations, personnel, services or products that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. See “Risks Relating to the Merger with NYMEX Holdings” for additional risks.  We also may seek to expand or enhance some of our operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world. Entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks, including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures, exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest, and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners. We also cannot assure you that any joint venture or alliance that we have entered into, including our agreement with Citadel as discussed in the following risk factor, or may enter into in the future, will be successful.  There is no guarantee that our credit default swap joint venture will be successful.  In December 2008, we announced that we had entered into a binding agreement with Citadel to launch a joint venture company that would offer a clearing solution and trading platform for the credit default market. The joint venture company intends to provide a compression facility linked to clearing for existing credit default swaps, known as credit default swaps contracts, a trading platform for credit default swaps contracts and various forms of access to our clearing house to clear credit default swaps. The current regulatory environment for trading and clearing credit default swaps is uncertain. Draft bills that would severely curtail the trading of credit default swaps or that might have the effect of regulating such transactions as insurance are being considered. Several state insurance commissioners have given notice that they may assert jurisdiction. While we have completed the review process with the Federal Reserve Board of New York and the CFTC and are in the process of seeking certain exemptive relief from the SEC, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain and retain all regulatory relief necessary to begin operations. We cannot be certain that we will be able to operate profitably under the conditions imposed to secure regulatory approval or if legislation or regulation adversely affects trading of credit default swaps contracts or reduces the demand for the joint venture’s offerings. In addition, a number of market participants and exchanges are developing competing platforms. Government backed initiatives in the European Union may favor clearing platforms in the European Union. We cannot be certain that our platform will be able to compete effectively with these or other alternative platforms.  Expansion of our operations internationally involves special challenges that we may not be able to meet, which could adversely affect our financial results.  We plan to continue to expand our operations internationally, including by directly placing order entry terminals with customers outside the United States and by relying on distribution systems established by our current and future strategic alliance partners. We face certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the regulated derivatives exchange business. These risks include:        •    restrictions on the use of trading terminals or the contracts that may be traded;        •    becoming subject to extensive regulations and oversight, tariffs and other trade barriers;        •    difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;        •    general economic and political conditions in the countries from which our markets are accessed, which may have an adverse effect on our volume from those countries; and        •    potentially adverse tax consequences.  In addition, as a result of our expanding global operations, we may become subject to the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities. These may include laws, rules and regulations relating to any aspect of the derivatives business. To date, we have had limited experience in marketing and operating our products and services internationally. We cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed in marketing our products and services in international markets. We may also experience difficulty in managing our international operations because of, among other things, competitive conditions overseas, management of foreign exchange risk, established domestic markets, language and cultural differences and economic or political instability. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of our international operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and operating results.    37    Table of Contents We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which may materially harm our business.   We rely primarily on trade secret, copyright, service mark, trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. We have filed several patent applications covering our technology in the United States and certain other jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property rights, it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights. We also seek to protect our software and databases as trade secrets and under copyright law. We have copyright registrations for certain of our software, user manuals and databases. The copyright protection afforded to databases, however, is fairly limited. While the arrangement and selection of data generally are protectable, the actual data may not be, and others may be free to create databases that would perform the same function. In some cases, including a number of our most important products, there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors. In addition, in the future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us and diversions of our resources, either of which could adversely affect our business.  Any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or increase the cost of providing, our products and electronic execution services.  Patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain of our products and services. Our competitors as well as other companies and individuals may obtain, and may be expected to obtain in the future, patents related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. In addition, some patent applications in the United States are confidential until a patent is issued and, therefore, we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications. These claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry.  In general, if one or more of our products or services were to infringe on patents held by others, we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims. We cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable to obtain such licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies.  We may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target of, or an indirect casualty of, attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations.  It is impossible to predict the likelihood or impact of any terrorist attack on the derivatives industry generally or on our business. For example, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center resulted in the closing of NYMEX’s trading and clearing operations for four business days and rendered its backup data and recovery center inoperable. While we have undertaken significant measures to develop business continuity plans and to establish backup sites, in the event of an attack or a threat of an attack, these security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business, technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business. Damage to our facilities due to terrorist attacks may be significantly in excess of any amount of insurance received, or we may not be able to insure against such damage at a reasonable price or at all. The threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.    38    Table of Contents Risks Relating to our Merger with NYMEX Holdings  We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings  On August 22, 2008, we completed our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings. The success of the transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings. We expect CME Group to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale, market integration and more automation. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons, including that the integration may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated.  The failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings in the expected time frame may adversely affect CME Group’s future results.  Prior to the completion of the transaction, CME Group and NYMEX Holdings historically operated as independent companies. The management of CME Group may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings and their subsidiaries, integrating their technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, as well as addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. In connection with the acquisition, CME Group expects to integrate certain operations of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings, including, among other things, back-office operations, information technology and regulatory compliance. However, the combined company will continue to operate a NYMEX trading floor at its existing location or an alternative location in New York, New York, as long as both revenue and profitability thresholds are achieved going forward. Given that historically CME Group has not operated a trading floor in a geographic location that is remote from its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, continuing to operate a NYMEX trading floor in New York, New York may present unique challenges. The integration of the two companies will be complex and time consuming, and require substantial resources and effort. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the transaction may disrupt ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with our members and other market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. If we fail to manage the integration of these businesses effectively, our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected, and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the transaction.  We have incurred costs in connection with our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings and will continue to incur costs in connection with the transaction.  CME Group and NYMEX Holdings have incurred significant costs associated with transaction fees, professional services and other costs related to the transaction and we will continue to incur additional costs, including restructuring costs, in connection with the integration of the business. Specifically, through December 31, 2008, CME Group and NYMEX Holdings have incurred approximately $104.5 million for transaction costs related to the transaction. Although CME Group expects that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.
