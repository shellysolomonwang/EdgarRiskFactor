ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.   We Are Affected by Difficult Conditions in the Global Financial Markets and Economic and Political Conditions Generally   We are engaged in various financial services businesses. As such, we are affected by economic and political conditions. These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors that may be detrimental to our operating results, including the inflation rate and the related impact on the securities markets, fluctuations in interest and currency rates, reduced investor confidence, a slowdown in economic activity and changes in volume and price levels of the securities markets. These conditions historically have impacted our trading volume and net revenues and affected our profitability. Additionally, a decline in the strength of the U.S. economy can lead to deterioration in credit quality and decreased loan demand. Continued or further credit dislocations or sustained market downturns may result in a decrease in the volume of trades we execute for our clients, a further decline in the value of securities we hold in inventory as assets, and continued reduced investment banking revenues given that associated fees are directly related to the number and size of transactions in which we participate. In addition, declines in the market value of securities generally result in a decline in revenues from fees based on the asset values of client portfolios, and may result in the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations, and in the failure of our clients to fulfill their credit and settlement obligations. During market downturns, our counterparties may be less likely to complete transactions. Also, we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin. During periods of steep declines in securities prices, the value of the collateral securing client accounts margin purchases may drop below the amount of the purchaser’s indebtedness. If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these loans, we may lose money on these margin transactions. This may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults. Dramatic declines in the real estate market over the past two years, with increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by other financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities, have in turn caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have ceased to provide or have reduced funding to even the most credit-worthy borrowers. These lender concerns are particularly severe with respect to financial institution borrowers. RJ Bank is particularly affected by domestic economic conditions. Such conditions include: U.S. interest rates, the rate of unemployment, real estate prices, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies, among others. The deterioration of these conditions can diminish loan demand, lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies, affect corporate loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net charge-offs, which can adversely affect our earnings.   Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States, non-U.S. governments and international agencies. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”) regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. FRB policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments. The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of financial assets that we hold, such as debt securities and loans. Changes in FRB policies are beyond our control and, consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict.   As described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources”, the failure of the financial markets to stabilize and a continuation or worsening of current financial market and economic conditions could continue to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our common stock.       15         Lack of Liquidity or Access to Capital Could Impair Our Business and Financial Condition   Liquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to our business. A compromise to our liquidity could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition. Some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets, diminished access to debt or equity markets, unforeseen cash or capital requirements and adverse legal settlements or judgments (including, among others, risks associated with auction rate securities). Our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries operate in highly regulated industries. These subsidiaries require access to funds in order to maintain certain capital and regulatory requirements. Therefore, these subsidiaries may, in some instances, not be able to pay dividends to fund the obligations of the parent including debt obligations and dividend payments. If existing sources of liquidity resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional outside financing or scale back or curtail our operations, including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors, selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us, cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders and reducing our operating expenses. The availability of outside financing, including access to the capital markets and bank lending, depends on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings. Our cost and availability of funding have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. As a result of concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, many lenders have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers, us included. As a result, we sold $300 million in senior notes in a registered underwritten public offering in August 2009. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our incremental borrowing costs, further limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain financial agreements. As such, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms, or at all. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk.   We are Exposed to Market Risk   We are, directly and indirectly, affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. For example, changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread – the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding – which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, derivatives and venture capital and merchant banking investments. Market conditions that may shift from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.   Certain of our venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings. The value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict. When, and if, we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, the prospects of the companies in which we invest, when these companies go public, the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions. Further, our investments could incur significant mark-to-market losses, especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.           16       We are Exposed to Credit Risk   We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We engage in trading and funding transactions with various counterparties. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. Deterioration in the credit quality of third parties who are indebted to us could result in losses. Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities, industries or to borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. The credit quality of our loan and investment portfolios can have a significant impact on earnings. Due to the growth in RJ Bank’s loan portfolio, credit risk at RJ Bank has become more significant to our overall financial performance. Continued declines in the real estate market or a sustained economic downturn may cause us to have to further write-down the value of some of the loans in RJ Bank’s portfolio, foreclose on certain real estate properties or write-down the value of some of RJ Bank’s available for sale securities portfolio. Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy. Our policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.   Our Business Depends on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products and on Fees Earned from the Management of Client Accounts by Our Asset Management Subsidiaries   A large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities. Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues, business and financial condition. In addition, if these products experience losses, or increased investor redemptions, we may receive reduced fees from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities. The investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition, renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new, lower-priced investment products and services. In addition, changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues, business and financial condition. Asset management fees often are comprised of base management and incentive fees. Management fees are primarily based on assets under management. If we experience losses of managed accounts, our fees will decline. In addition, the relative investment performance of these accounts could impact our ability to attract and retain clients and thus affect our revenues, business and financial condition.   We Are Exposed to Operational Risk   Our diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Our business depends on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. Operational risk exists in every activity, function or unit of our business, and can take the form of internal or external fraud, employment and hiring practices, an error in meeting a professional obligation, failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards, business disruption or system failures and failed transaction processing. Also, increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors, including outsourced operations. In addition, significant operational loss could damage our reputation. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk.         17       The Soundness of Other Financial Institutions and Intermediaries Affects Us   We face the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions. In recent years there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses, which has increased our exposure to certain financial intermediaries and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in such events. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients and manage our exposure to risk.   Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, funding, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.   Our Business Depends on Technology   Our businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems. In addition to better serving clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables firms to reduce costs. Our continued success will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems, our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees. Failure of our systems, which could result from events beyond our control, or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services, could result in financial losses, liability to clients and damage to our reputation. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our own or our clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed, stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our own, our clients’, our counterparties’ or third parties’ operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing this type of operational risk.   We Face Intense Competition   We are engaged in intensely competitive businesses. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of our financial advisors and associates, our products and services and location and reputation in local markets. Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. Because of continued market unrest and increased government intervention, this trend toward consolidation has intensified. See the section entitled “Competition” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors. Our ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and skills of our employees and financial advisors. As such, to compete effectively, we must attract, retain and motivate qualified associates, including successful financial advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel. Competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse affect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.       18         We Operate in a Highly Regulated Industry in which Future Developments Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Financial Condition   The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation, and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business. We could be subject to civil liability, criminal liability or sanctions, including revocation of our subsidiaries’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers, revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors, censures, fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, if laws or regulations are violated. Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects. Our banking operations also expose us to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws. In light of current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and the economy, legislators and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry by introducing proposals for new legislation and regulations. We are unable to predict whether any of these proposals will be implemented and in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our banking operations may be required to increase its regulatory capital and be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums, including special assessments, due to the significant impact market developments have had on the insurance fund of the FDIC. We may also be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws, or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. See the section entitled “Business – Regulation” within Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk. Regulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition or results of operation, or cause us serious reputational harm.   Our Business and Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected by New Regulations to Which We Expect to Become Subject as a Result of Becoming a Financial Holding Company   In September 2008, we announced that we would seek approval from the Federal Reserve Board to become a bank holding company and subsequently elect to become a financial holding company. Although we have a statutory grace period of two years, with the possibility of three one-year extensions for a total grace period of up to five years, to conform existing activities and investments to the restrictions on nonbanking activities that apply to financial holding companies, and although we expect to be able to continue to engage in the vast majority of the activities in which we currently engage after such time, it is possible that certain of our existing activities will not be deemed to be permissible under applicable regulations. In addition, as a financial holding company, we will become subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the FRB, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements and information reporting requirements, and, as a nationally-chartered commercial bank, RJ Bank will be subject to the functional supervision and regulation of the OCC. See the section entitled “Business –Regulation” of Item 1 of this report for additional information.   We Are Exposed to Litigation Risks   Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, arising from the normal course of business. We have been named as a defendant or co-defendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages. The risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability to us. Our Private Client Group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses.         19       In turbulent times such as these, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have historically increased. These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions, issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients' investment objectives (including auction rate securities), the ability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions, contractual issues, employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions. We have received inquiries from the SEC, FINRA and several state regulatory authorities requesting information concerning auction rate securities. We have also been named in civil class action lawsuits relating to sales of auction rate securities and disclosures relating to bank reserves, respectively. We are working with other industry participants in order to resolve issues relating to auction rate securities and are exploring a range of potential solutions. If we were to determine, in order to resolve pending claims, inquiries or investigations, to repurchase at par value auction rate securities from certain of our clients, we would be required to assess whether we have sufficient regulatory capital and cash or borrowing capacity to do so, and there can be no assurance that we would have such capacity. Substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” of this report for a discussion of our legal matters (including auction rate securities) and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report regarding our approach to managing legal risk.   Damage to our Reputation Could Damage our Businesses   Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior and the activities of customers and counterparties. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our prospects.   The Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements Requires the Use of Estimates that May Vary From Actual Results and New Accounting Standards Could Adversely Affect Future Reported Results   The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. One of our most critical estimates is RJ Bank’s allowance for loan losses. The current condition of the real estate and credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank’s loan portfolio. If management’s underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. Our financial condition, including our liquidity and capital, and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies” for additional information on the sensitivity of these estimates.   Certain of our financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain trading assets and liabilities, certain available for sale securities, certain loans and private equity investments, among other items, require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment. Some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings.         20       Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. For a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards, see the “Critical Accounting Policies” discussion within Item 7 of this report and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Our Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave Us Exposed to Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk   We seek to manage, monitor and control our operational, legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms, however, there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective. Further, our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. In addition, some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets, clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate. In addition, RJ Bank has undergone significant growth in recent years. A failure to adequately manage the growth of RJ Bank, or to effectively manage our risk, could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. Our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business. We have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect our reputation, the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us. For more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report.    We are Exposed to Risk from International Markets   We do business in other parts of the world, including in a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets, and as a result, are exposed to a number of risks, including economic, market, reputational, litigation and regulatory risks, in non-U.S. markets. Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social or political instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments. We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. The impact of these fluctuations could be magnified, because generally non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in emerging market countries, are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets.   The Market Price of Our Common Stock May Continue to be Volatile   The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be more volatile than in prior years and subject to fluctuations. Stocks of financial institutions have experienced significant downward pressure in connection with the current economic downturn and may again experience such pressures in the future. Significant declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm our ability to recruit and retain key employees, reduce our access to debt or equity capital and otherwise harm our business or financial condition.         21         Our Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious Weather Conditions   Our principal operations are located in St. Petersburg, Florida. While we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from our Southfield, Michigan location (see Item 1, “Business” in this report), our operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect the processing of transactions and communications. Our business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at the headquarters complex. We have also developed a business continuity plan for our Private Client Group branches in the event these branches are impacted by severe weather. Each branch is assigned a “contingency branch” in another part of the country that allows the impacted branch the ability to communicate through the contingency branch.   We have Self-insurance Risks   Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance, self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks, including, without limitation, property and casualty, workers’ compensation, general liability and the portion of employee-related health care benefits plans we fund.
