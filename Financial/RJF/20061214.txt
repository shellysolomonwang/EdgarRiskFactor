ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Economic and Political Developments and Their Impact on Securities Markets Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Business   The Company is engaged in various financial services businesses. As such, the Company is directly affected by general economic and political conditions, changes in the rate of inflation and the related impact on securities markets, fluctuations in interest and currency rates, investor confidence, and changes in volume and price levels of the securities markets. Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce the Company’s trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect its profitability.    The Company Faces Intense Competition   The Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses. See the section entitled “Competition” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about the Company’s competitors. Competitive pressures experienced by the Company could have an adverse affect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.            11               Regulatory and Legal Developments Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Business   The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker-dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business. See the section entitled “Regulation” of Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company’s regulatory environment and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”, for a discussion of the Company’s legal matters. The Company could be subject to civil liability, criminal liability, or sanctions, including revocation of its subsidiaries’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers, revocation of the licenses of its Financial Advisors, censures, fines, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, if it violates such laws or regulations. Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and business prospects. In addition, the regulatory environment in which the Company operates frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years. The Company may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations, changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws, or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations.   The Company’s Business Is Highly Dependent on Technology  The Company’s businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems, and its continued success will depend upon its ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of those systems and retain skilled information technology employees. Failure of those systems, which could result from events beyond the Company’s control, could result in financial losses, liability to clients and damage to the Company’s reputation.   The Company’s Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious Weather Conditions  The Company’s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg, Florida. During 2004 and 2005, there was a significant increase in hurricane activity on the Gulf Coast which has directly affected other parts of Florida. While the Company has a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from its Southfield, Michigan location (see Item 1, “Business” in this report), the Company’s operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect processing of transactions and communications. In addition, as a result of high levels of storm induced damage during these years in Florida and along the Gulf Coast, insurance coverage for wind and flood damage has become harder to obtain and substantially more expensive. As a consequence, the Company has been forced to pay more for the limited coverage it obtained and self-insure against these risks to a greater degree than in the past.  The Company’s Business is Dependent on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products  A large portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities. Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect the Company’s revenues and profits.  Other Risks  See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report regarding the Company’s exposure to, and approaches to managing, market risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk, operational risk and regulatory and legal risk.
