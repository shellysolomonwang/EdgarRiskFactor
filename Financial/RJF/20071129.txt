ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of its common stock.  Economic and Political Developments and Their Impact on Securities Markets Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Business  The Company is engaged in various financial services businesses. As such, the Company is directly affected by general economic and political conditions, changes in the rate of inflation and the related impact on securities markets, fluctuations in interest and currency rates, investor confidence, and changes in volume and price levels of the securities markets. Severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce the Company’s trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect its profitability.  The Company Faces Intense Competition  The Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses. See the section entitled “Competition” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about the Company’s competitors. Competitive pressures experienced by the Company could have an adverse affect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.         10             Regulatory and Legal Developments Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Business  The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker-dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business. See the section entitled “Regulation” of Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company’s regulatory environment and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings”, for a discussion of the Company’s legal matters. The Company could be subject to civil liability, criminal liability, or sanctions, including revocation of its subsidiaries’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers, revocation of the licenses of its Financial Advisors, censures, fines, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, if it violates such laws or regulations. Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and business prospects. The Company’s banking operations also expose it to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws. In addition, the regulatory environment in which the Company operates frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years. The Company may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations, changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws, or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations.   The Company’s Business Is Highly Dependent on Technology  The Company’s businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems, and its continued success will depend upon its ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of those systems and retain skilled information technology employees. Failure of those systems, which could result from events beyond the Company’s control, could result in financial losses, liability to clients and damage to the Company’s reputation.  The Company Is Exposed to Market Risk  The Company, directly and indirectly, is affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. For example, changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Company’s net interest margin – the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rate the Company pays for deposits and other sources of funding – which could in turn affect the Company’s net interest income and earnings. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with the Company’s operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market conditions that may shift from time to time, thereby exposing the Company to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer.  The Company Is Exposed to Credit Risk  The credit quality of the Company’s loan and investment portfolios can have a significant impact on earnings. Credit risk is the risk of loss from a debtor’s inability to meet financial obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms. Risks associated with credit quality include adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of the Company’s debtors that could affect the debtors’ repayment of outstanding obligations, and that the strength of the U.S. economy may be different than expected resulting in deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit.  The Company Is Exposed to Operational Risk  The Company’s diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. Operational risk exists in every activity, function, or unit of the Company, and includes: internal or external fraud, employment and hiring practices, an error in meeting a professional obligation, business disruption or system failures, and failed transaction processing. Also, increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors, including outsourced operations. Damage to the Company’s reputation could also result from a significant operational loss.  The Company’s Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious WeatherConditions  The Company’s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg, Florida. During 2004 and 2005, there was a significant increase in hurricane activity on the Gulf Coast which directly affected other parts of Florida. While the Company has a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from its Southfield, Michigan location (see Item 1, “Business” in this report), the Company’s operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect processing of transactions and communications. In addition, as a result of high levels of storm induced damage during these years in Florida and along the Gulf Coast, insurance coverage for wind and flood damage has become harder to obtain and substantially more expensive. As a consequence, the Company has been forced to pay more for the limited coverage it obtained and self-insure against these risks to a greater degree than in the past.  The Company’s Business is Dependent on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products and on Fees Earned from the Management of Client Accounts By Our Asset Management Subsidiaries  A large portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities. Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect the Company’s revenues and profits. Further, changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts could affect the Company’s revenues and profits.         11             Insurance Risks  The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to its use of a combination of insurance, self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks, including, without limitation, property and casualty, workers’ compensation, general liability, and the Company-funded portion of employee-related health care benefits.  Other Risks  See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report regarding the Company’s exposure to, and approaches to managing, market risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit risk, operational risk and regulatory and legal risk.
