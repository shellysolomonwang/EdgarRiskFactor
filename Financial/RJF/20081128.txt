ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of its common stock.        15          The Company is Affected by Difficult Conditions in the Global Financial Markets and Economic and Political Conditions Generally  The Company is engaged in various financial services businesses. As such, the Company is affected by economic and political conditions. These conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors that may be detrimental to the operating results of the company, including the inflation rate and the related impact on the securities markets, fluctuations in interest and currency rates, reduced investor confidence, a slowdown in economic activity, and changes in volume and price levels of the securities markets. These conditions historically have reduced the Company’s trading volume and net revenues and adversely affected its profitability. Additionally, a decline in the strength of the U.S. economy can lead to deterioration in credit quality and decreased loan demand. Continued or further credit dislocations or sustained market downturns may result in a decrease in the volume of trades the Company executes for its clients, a decline in the value of securities it holds in inventory as assets, and reduced investment banking revenues given that associated fees are directly related to the number and size of transactions in which the Company participates. In addition, declines in the market value of securities generally result in a decline in revenues from fees based on the asset values of client portfolios, in the failure of buyers and sellers of securities to fulfill their settlement obligations, and in the failure of the Company’s clients to fulfill their credit and settlement obligations. During market downturns, the Company’s counterparties may be less likely to complete transactions. Also, the Company permits its clients to purchase securities on margin. During periods of steep declines in securities prices, the value of the collateral securing client accounts margin purchases may drop below the amount of the purchaser’s indebtedness. If the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these loans, the Company may lose money on these margin transactions. This may cause the Company to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults. Dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year, with increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by other financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities, in turn have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have ceased to provide funding to even the most credit-worthy borrowers. These lender concerns are particularly severe with respect to financial institution borrowers. As described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources,” the resulting lack of available credit and lack of confidence in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as its access to capital.  Lack of Liquidity or Access to Capital Could Impair the Company’s Business and Financial Condition  Liquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to the Company’s business. A compromise to the Company’s liquidity could have a significant negative effect on the Company. Some potential conditions that could negatively affect the Company’s liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets, diminished access to debt or capital markets, unforeseen cash or capital requirements and adverse legal settlements or judgments (including, among others, risks associated with auction rate securities). The Company’s largest subsidiaries operate in highly regulated industries. These subsidiaries require access to funds in order to maintain certain net capital requirements. If existing internal sources of liquidity resources do not satisfy the Company’s needs, it may have to seek outside financing or scale back or curtail its operations, including limiting its efforts to recruit additional Financial Advisors, selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to the Company, cutting or eliminating the dividends it pays to its shareholders and reducing its operating expenses. The availability of outside financing, including access to the capital markets and bank lending, depends on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and the Company’s credit ratings. The Company’s cost and availability of funding have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. In addition, a reduction in the Company’s credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity and competitive position, increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets or trigger its obligations under certain financial agreements. As a result of concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, many lenders have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers, including the Company. As such, the Company may not be able to successfully obtain outside financing to fund its operations on favorable terms, or at all. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources,” for additional information on liquidity and how the Company manages its liquidity risk.       16           The Company is Exposed to Market Risk  The Company, directly and indirectly, is affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. For example, changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Company’s net interest spread – the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rate the Company pays for deposits and other sources of funding – which could in turn affect the Company’s net interest income and earnings. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with the Company’s operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Market conditions that may shift from time to time, thereby exposing the Company to market risk, include fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report for additional information regarding the Company’s exposure to and approaches to managing market risk.  The Company Is Exposed to Credit Risk  The Company is exposed to the risk that third parties that owe it money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default in their obligations to the Company due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Deterioration in the credit quality of third parties who are indebted to the Company could result in losses. In addition, the credit quality of the Company’s loan and investment portfolios can have a significant impact on earnings. Due to the growth in RJBank’s loan portfolio, credit risk at RJBank has become more significant. Continued declines in the housing market or a sustained economic downturn may cause the Company to have to write-down the value of some of the loans in RJBank’s’s portfolio. Credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of the Company’s debtors or deterioration in the strength of the U.S. economy, such as the U.S. is currently experiencing. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report for additional information regarding the Company’s exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk.  The Market Price of the Company’s Common Stock May Continue to be Volatile  The market price of the Company’s common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be more volatile than in prior years and subject to fluctuations. Stocks of financial institutions have experienced significant downward pressure in connection with the current economic downturn and may continue to experience such pressures in the future. Significant declines in the market price of the Company’s common stock or failure of the market price to increase could harm its ability to recruit and retain key employees, reduce its access to debt or equity capital and otherwise harm the Company’s business or financial condition.  The Company’s Business Depends on Fees Generated from the Distribution of Financial Products and on Fees Earned from the Management of Client Accounts By the Company’s Asset Management Subsidiaries  A large portion of the Company’s revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities. Changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect the Company’s revenues, business and financial condition. In addition, if these products experience losses, or increased investor redemptions, the Company may receive reduced fees from the investment management and distribution services it provides on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities. The investment management fees the Company is paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition, renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new, lower-priced investment products and services. In addition, changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect the Company’s revenues, business and financial condition. Asset management fees often are comprised of base management and incentive fees. Management fees are primarily based on assets under management. If the Company experiences losses in its managed accounts, its fees will decline. In addition, the relative investment performance of these accounts could affect the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients and thus affect the Company’s revenues, business and financial condition.       17           The Company Faces Intense Competition  The Company is engaged in intensely competitive businesses. The Company competes on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its Financial Advisors and associates, its products and services and location and reputation in local markets. Over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of the Company’s competitors. Because of recent market unrest and increased government intervention, this trend toward consolidation has intensified. See the section entitled “Competition” of Item 1 of this report for additional information about the Company’s competitors. The Company’s ability to develop and retain its client base depends on the reputation, judgment, business generation capabilities and skills of its employees and Financial Advisors. As such, to compete effectively, the Company must attract, retain, and motivate qualified associates, including successful Financial Advisors, investment bankers, trading professionals, portfolio managers and other revenue-producing or specialized personnel. Competitive pressures experienced by the Company could have an adverse affect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Regulatory and Legal Developments Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Business and Financial Condition  The securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business. The Company could be subject to civil liability, criminal liability, or sanctions, including revocation of its subsidiaries’ registrations as investment advisors or broker-dealers, revocation of the licenses of its Financial Advisors, censures, fines, or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, if it violates such laws or regulations. Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and prospects. The Company’s banking operations also expose it to a risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with banking laws. In light of current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and the economy, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry, including by introducing proposals for new legislation. The Company is unable to predict whether any of these proposals will be implemented and in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws, or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. See the section entitled “Business – Regulation” of Item 1 of this report for additional information regarding the Company’s regulatory environment and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report regarding the Company’s approaches to managing regulatory risk. Legal actions brought against the Company may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Company, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operation, or cause it serious reputational harm.  In turbulent times such as these, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions have historically increased. These risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions, issues related to the suitability of its investment advice based on the Company’s clients' investment objectives (including auction rate securities), the ability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions, contractual issues, employment claims, and potential liability for other advice it provides to participants in strategic transactions. The Company has received inquiries from the SEC, the FINRA and several state regulatory authorities requesting information concerning auction rate securities. The Company has also been named in a civil class action lawsuit relating to sales of auction rate securities. The Company is working with other industry participants in order to resolve issues relating to auction rate securities and is exploring a range of potential solutions. If the Company were to determine, in order to resolve pending claims, inquiries or investigations, to repurchase at par value auction rate securities from certain of its clients, the Company would be required to assess whether it has sufficient regulatory capital and cash or borrowing capacity to do so, and there can be no assurance that the Company would have such capacity. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” of this report for a discussion of the Company’s legal matters (including auction rate securities) and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report regarding the Company’s approaches to managing legal risk.       18           The Company’s Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave it Exposed to Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk  The Company seeks to manage, monitor and control its operational, legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms, however, there can be no assurance that its procedures will be fully effective. Further, the Company’s risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. In addition, some of the Company’s risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets, clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate. In addition, RJBank has undergone significant growth in recent years. A failure to adequately manage the growth of RJBank, or to effectively manage the Company’s risk, could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition. The Company must also address potential conflicts of interest that arise in its business. The Company has procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest, but identifying and managing potential conflicts of interest can be complex and difficult and the Company’s reputation could be damaged if its fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. For more information on how the Company monitors and manages market and certain other risks, see Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report.  The Company Is Exposed to Operational Risk  The Company’s diverse operations are exposed to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. The Company’s business depends on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions. The Company’s financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, adversely affecting its ability to process these transactions or provide these services. Operational risk exists in every activity, function, or unit of the Company, and can take the form of internal or external fraud, employment and hiring practices, an error in meeting a professional obligation, business disruption or system failures, and failed transaction processing. Also, increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors, including outsourced operations. The Company also faces the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that it uses to facilitate its securities transactions. In recent years there has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses, which has increased the Company’s exposure to certain financial intermediaries the Company uses and could affect its ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in such events. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect the Company’s ability to effect transactions, service its clients and manage its exposure to risk. In addition, significant operational loss could damage the Company’s reputation. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report for additional information regarding the Company’s exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk.        19          The Company’s Business Depends on Technology  The Company’s businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems. In addition to better serving clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables firms to reduce costs. The Company’s continued success will depend, in part, upon its ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of its systems, its ability to address the needs of its clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and its ability to retain skilled information technology employees. Failure of its systems, which could result from events beyond the Company’s control, or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technology-driven products or services, could result in financial losses, liability to clients and damage to the Company’s reputation. The Company’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Although the Company takes protective measures and endeavors to modify them as circumstances warrant, the computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize the Company’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed, stored in and transmitted through its computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in the Company’s, its clients’, its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations. The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications, and it may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or not fully covered through any insurance it maintains. See Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this report for additional information regarding the Company’s exposure to and approaches to managing this type of operational risk.  The Company’s Business and Financial Condition Could be Adversely Affected by New Regulations to Which It Expects to Become Subject as a Result of Becoming a Financial Holding Company  In September 2008, the Company announced that it will seek approval from the Federal Reserve Board to become a bank holding company and subsequently elect to become a financial holding company. Although the Company has a statutory grace period of two years, with the possibility of three one-year extensions for a total grace period of five years, to conform existing activities and investments to the restrictions on nonbanking activities that apply to financial holding companies, and although it expects to be able to continue to engage in the vast majority of the activities in which it currently engages after such time, it is possible that certain of the Company’s existing activities will not be deemed to be permissible under applicable regulations. In addition, as a financial holding company, the Company will become subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve Board, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements and information reporting requirements, and, as a nationally-chartered commercial bank, RJBank will be subject to the functional supervision and regulation of the OCC. See the section entitled “Business –Regulation” of Item 1 of this report for additional information.  The Company’s Operations Could Be Adversely Affected By Serious Weather Conditions  The Company’s principal operations are located in St. Petersburg, Florida. While the Company has a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from its Southfield, Michigan location (see Item 1, “Business” in this report), the Company’s operations could be adversely affected by hurricanes or other serious weather conditions that could affect processing of transactions and communications. For the past several years, the Company has been unable to obtain meaningful hurricane-related insurance coverage at a reasonable cost for its headquarters complex in St. Petersburg, Florida. Due to the modest hurricane activity during the past three seasons, such coverage has become more readily available and, effective May 15, 2008, the Company has increased its limits to levels management considers adequate for such a catastrophe. Notwithstanding this coverage, the Company’s business continuity plan continues to be enhanced and tested to allow for continuous business processing in the event of weather-related or other interruptions of operations at the headquarters complex. The Company has also developed a business continuity plan for its Private Client Group branches in the event these branches are impacted by severe weather. Each branch is assigned a “contingency branch” in another part of the country that allows the impacted branch the ability to communicate through the contingency branch.        20          Insurance Risks  The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to its use of a combination of insurance, self-insured retention and self-insurance for a number of risks, including, without limitation, property and casualty, workers’ compensation, general liability, and the Company-funded portion of employee-related health care benefits.
