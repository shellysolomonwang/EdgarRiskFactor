Item 1A. Risk Factors — Reinsurance; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Reinsurance; and Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements.     10 AIG 2007 Form 10-K    Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             Insurance Investment Operations   A significant portion of AIG’s General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services revenues are derived from AIG’s insurance investment operations.   The following table summarizes the investment results of the insurance operations:                                                           Annual Average Cash and Invested Assets                           Cash       Return on           (including       Average Cash   Return on   Years Ended December 31,   short-term   Invested       and Invested   Average Invested   (in millions)   investments)(a)   Assets(a)   Total   Assets(b)   Assets(c)         General Insurance:                                                2007    $ 5,874     $ 117,050     $ 122,924       5.0 %     5.2 %       2006      3,201       102,231       105,432       5.4       5.6         2005      2,450       86,211       88,661       4.5       4.7         2004      2,012       73,338       75,350       4.2       4.4         2003      1,818       59,855       61,673       4.2       4.3       Life Insurance & Retirement Services:                                                2007    $ 25,926     $ 423,473     $ 449,669       5.0 %     5.3 %       2006      13,698       392,348       406,046       4.9       5.1         2005      11,137       356,839       367,976       5.1       5.2         2004      7,737       309,627       317,364       4.9       5.1         2003      4,680       247,608       252,288       5.3       5.4                 (a)   Including investment income due and accrued and real estate. Also, includes collateral assets invested under the global securities lending program.       (b)   Net investment income divided by the annual average sum of cash and invested assets.       (c)   Net investment income divided by the annual average invested assets.    AIG’s worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in government and other high quality, fixed income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a lesser extent, investments in high yield bonds, common stocks, real estate, hedge funds and partnerships, in order to enhance returns on policyholders’ funds and generate net investment income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited in certain territories as there may be a lack of adequate long-term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed by the local regulatory authorities.   Financial Services Operations   AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets, consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Together, the Aircraft Leasing, Capital Markets and Consumer Finance operations generate the majority of the revenues produced by the Financial Services operations. A.I. Credit also contributes to Financial Services income principally by providing insurance premium financing for both AIG’s policyholders and those of other insurers.   Aircraft Leasing    Aircraft Leasing operations represent the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for ILFC’s own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and financial institutions. See also Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Capital Markets    Capital Markets represents the operations of AIGFP, which engages as principal in a wide variety of financial transactions, including standard and customized financial products involving commodities, credit, currencies, energy, equities and rates. The credit products include credit protection written through credit default swaps on super senior risk tranches of diversified pools of loans and debt securities. AIGFP also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and principal investments and engages in borrowing activities that include issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs).   Consumer Finance    Consumer Finance operations include AGF as well as AIGCFG. AGF provides a wide variety of consumer finance products, including real estate and non-real estate loans, retail sales finance and credit-related insurance to customers in the United States, the U.K., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. AGF’s finance receivables are primarily sourced through its branches, although many of AGF’s real estate loans are sourced through its centralized real estate operations, which include AGF’s mortgage banking activities. AIGCFG, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in developing a multi-product consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging and developing markets.   Asset Management Operations   AIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment-related services and investment products. These ser-    AIG 2007 Form 10-K   11    Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             vices and products are offered to individuals, pension funds and institutions globally through AIG’s Spread-Based Investment business, Institutional Asset Management, and Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds business. Also included in Asset Management operations are the results of certain SunAmerica sponsored partnership investments.   Spread-Based Investment Business    AIG’s Spread-Based Investment business includes the results of AIG’s proprietary spread-based investment operations, the Matched Investment Program (MIP), which was launched in September of 2005 to replace the Guaranteed Investment Contract (GIC) program, which is in runoff. The MIP is an investment strategy that involves investing in various asset classes with financing provided through third parties. This business uses various risk mitigating strategies designed to hedge interest rate and currency risk associated with underlying investments and related liabilities.   Institutional Asset Management    AIG’s Institutional Asset Management business, conducted through AIG Investments, provides an array of investment products and services globally to institutional investors, pension funds, AIG subsidiaries and high net worth investors. These products include traditional equity and fixed income investments, and a wide range of alternative asset classes. These services include investment advisory and subadvisory services, investment monitoring and investment transaction structuring. Within the fixed income and equity asset classes, AIG Investments offers various forms of structured investments aimed at achieving superior returns or capital preservation. Within the alternative asset class, AIG Investments offers hedge and private equity fund-of-funds, direct investments and distressed debt investments.   AIG Global Real Estate provides a wide range of real estate investment and management services for AIG subsidiaries, as well as for third-party institutional investors, high net worth investors and pension funds. Through a strategic network of local real estate ventures, AIG Global Real Estate actively invests in and develops office, industrial, multi-family residential, retail, hotel and resort properties globally.   AIG Private Bank offers banking, trading and investment management services to private clients and institutions globally.   From time to time, AIG Investments acquires alternative investments, primarily consisting of direct controlling equity interests in private enterprises, with the intention of “warehousing” such investments until the investment or economic benefit thereof is transferred to a fund or other AIG-managed investment product. During the warehousing period, AIG bears the cost and risks associated with carrying these investments and consolidates them on its balance sheet and records the operating results until the investments are transferred, sold or otherwise divested. Changes in market conditions may negatively affect the fair value of these warehoused investments. Market conditions may impede AIG from launching new investment products for which these warehoused assets are being held, which could result in AIG not recovering its investment upon transfer or divestment. In the event that AIG is unable to transfer or otherwise divest its interest in the warehoused investment to third parties, AIG could be required to hold these investments indefinitely. In certain instances, the consolidated warehoused investments are not wholly owned by AIG. In such cases, AIG shares the risk associated with warehousing the asset with the minority interest investors.   Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds    AIG’s Brokerage Services and Mutual Funds business, conducted through AIG Advisor Group, Inc. and AIG SunAmerica Asset Management Corp., provides broker-dealer related services and mutual funds to retail investors, group trusts and corporate accounts through an independent network of financial advisors. AIG Advisor Group, Inc., a subsidiary of AIG Retirement Services, Inc., is comprised of several broker-dealer entities that provide these services to clients primarily in the U.S. marketplace. AIG SunAmerica Asset Management Corp. manages, advises and/or administers retail mutual funds, as well as the underlying assets of variable annuities sold by AIG SunAmerica and VALIC to individuals and groups throughout the United States.   Other Asset Management    Included in Other Asset Management is income or loss from certain AIG SunAmerica sponsored partnerships and partnership investments. Partnership assets consist of investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds, affordable housing partnerships and hedge fund investments.   Other Operations   Certain AIG subsidiaries provide insurance-related services such as adjusting claims and marketing specialized products. Several wholly owned foreign subsidiaries of AIG operating in countries or jurisdictions such as Ireland, Bermuda, Barbados and Gibraltar provide insurance and related administrative and back office services to affiliated and unaffiliated insurance and reinsurance companies, including captive insurance companies unaffiliated with AIG.   AIG has several other subsidiaries that engage in various businesses. Mt. Mansfield Company, Inc. owns and operates the ski slopes, lifts, a school and an inn located in Stowe, Vermont. Also reported in AIG’s Other operations are interest expense, expenses of corporate staff not attributable to specific business segments, expenses related to efforts to improve internal controls, corporate initiatives, certain compensation plan expenses and the settlement costs more fully described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 12(a) to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Additional Investments   AIG’s significant investments in partially owned companies (which are accounted for under the equity method) include a 25.4 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., a general insurance company in Japan, a 26.0 percent interest in Tata AIG Life Insurance Company, Ltd. and a 26.0 percent interest     12 AIG 2007 Form 10-K    Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             in Tata AIG General Insurance Company, Ltd. in India. Substantially all of AIG’s equity interest in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd. was sold by AIG in December 2007. For a discussion of AIG’s investments in partially owned companies, see Note 1(s) to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Locations of Certain Assets   As of December 31, 2007, approximately 37 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $4.4 billion of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including tax changes, nationalization and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG’s policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG’s business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company’s ability to repatriate assets and profits. See also Notes 1 and 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors — Foreign Operations.   Regulation   AIG’s operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. The regulatory environment can have a significant effect on AIG and its business. AIG’s operations have become more diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. Although AIG cannot predict the scope or effect of such regulation on its business, AIG expects further regulation of its domestic consumer finance operations as a result of the current disruption of the U.S. residential mortgage market. In addition, the investigations into financial accounting practices that led to two restatements of AIG’s consolidated financial statements have heightened regulatory scrutiny of AIG worldwide.   In 1999, AIG became a unitary thrift holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (HOLA) when the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) granted AIG approval to organize AIG Federal Savings Bank. AIG is subject to OTS regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the OTS has enforcement authority over AIG and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this permits the OTS to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of AIG’s subsidiary savings association, AIG Federal Savings Bank.   Under prior law, a unitary savings and loan holding company, such as AIG, was not restricted as to the types of business in which it could engage, provided that its savings association subsidiary continued to be a qualified thrift lender. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) provides that no company may acquire control of an OTS regulated institution after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. The GLBA, however, grandfathered the unrestricted authority for activities with respect to a unitary savings and loan holding company existing prior to May 4, 1999, so long as its savings association subsidiary continues to be a qualified thrift lender under the HOLA. As a unitary savings and loan holding company whose application was pending as of May 4, 1999, AIG is grandfathered under the GLBA and generally is not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender under the HOLA.   Certain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate services and transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG’s subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states that have such requirements.   AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk-based capital, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies.   AIG has taken various steps to enhance the capital positions of the Domestic General Insurance companies. AIG entered into capital maintenance agreements with the Domestic General Insurance companies that set forth procedures through which AIG will provide ongoing capital support. Also, in order to allow the Domestic General Insurance companies to record as an admitted asset at December 31, 2007 certain reinsurance ceded to non-U.S. reinsurers (which has the effect of increasing the statutory surplus of such Domestic General Insurance companies), AIG obtained and entered into reimbursement agreements for approximately $1.8 billion of letters of credit issued by several commercial banks in favor of certain Domestic General Insurance companies.   In the U.S., Risk-Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified. The U.S. RBC formula develops a risk-adjusted target level of statutory    AIG 2007 Form 10-K   13    Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             surplus by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer’s size, but also based on the risk profile of the insurer’s operations.   The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to placing the insurer under regulatory control.   The statutory surplus of each of AIG’s Domestic General Insurance and Life Insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC target levels as of December 31, 2007.   To the extent that any of AIG’s insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be AIG’s intention to provide appropriate capital or other types of support to that entity.   A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and these subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIG has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions.   In addition to licensing requirements, AIG’s foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local government, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG subsidiaries, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.   See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity — Regulation and Supervision and Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Competition   AIG’s Insurance, Financial Services and Asset Management businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are insurance companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions.   The insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,400 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG’s subsidiaries offering Life Insurance & Retirement Services compete in the United States with approximately 2,100 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers, global insurance groups and local companies in particular areas in which they are active.   Directors and Executive Officers of AIG   All directors of AIG are elected for one-year terms at the annual meeting of shareholders. All executive officers are elected to one-year terms, but serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.   Except as hereinafter noted, each of the executive officers has, for more than five years, occupied an executive position with AIG or companies that are now its subsidiaries. Other than the employment contracts between AIG and Messrs. Sullivan and Bensinger, there are no other arrangements or understandings between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was elected to such position. From January 2000 until joining AIG in May 2004, Dr. Frenkel served as Chairman of Merrill Lynch International, Inc. Prior to joining AIG in September 2006, Ms. Kelly served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of MCI/ WorldCom. Previously, she was Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Sears, Roebuck and Co. from 1999 to 2003. From June 2004 until joining AIG in May 2007, Mr. Kaslow was a managing partner of QuanStar Group, LLC (an advisory services firm), and, from January 2002 until May 2004, Mr. Kaslow was Senior Executive Vice President of Human Resources for Vivendi Universal (an entertainment and telecommunications company).     14 AIG 2007 Form 10-K    Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             Set forth below is information concerning the directors and executive officers of AIG as of February 28, 2008.

Risk Factors   Casualty Insurance Underwriting and Reserves    Casualty insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss expenses. Although AIG annually reviews the adequacy of the established reserve for losses and loss expenses, there can be no assurance that AIG’s loss reserves will not develop adversely and have a material effect on AIG’s results of operations. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty lines of business, which include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general liability, products liability and related classes, as well as for asbestos and environmental exposures. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential for reserves with respect to a number of years to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic phenomena affecting claims, such as the effects that the recent disruption in the credit markets could have on reported claims under D&O or professional liability coverages. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Operating Review — General Insurance Operations — Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses.   Credit Market Environment    AIG’s businesses may continue to be adversely affected by the current disruption in the global credit markets and repricing of credit risk. During the second half of 2007, disruption in the global credit markets, coupled with the repricing of credit risk, and the U.S. housing market deterioration created increasingly difficult conditions in the financial markets. These conditions have resulted in greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets. These conditions continue to adversely affect Mortgage Guaranty’s results of operations and the fair value of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio and contribute to higher levels of finance receivables delinquencies at AGF and to the severe and rapid decline in the fair value of certain investment securities, particularly those backed by U.S. residential mortgage loans. It is difficult to predict how long these conditions will exist and how AIG’s markets, products and businesses will continue to be adversely affected. Accordingly, these conditions could adversely affect AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations in future periods. In addition, litigation and regulatory or governmental investigations and inquiries have been commenced against AIG related to these events and AIG may become subject to further litigation and regulatory or governmental scrutiny as a result of these events.   Risk Management    AIG is exposed to a number of significant risks, and AIG’s risk management processes and controls may not be fully effective in mitigating AIG’s risk exposures in all market conditions and to all types of risk. The major risks to which AIG is exposed include: credit risk, market risk, operational risk, liquidity risk and insurance risk. AIG has devoted significant resources to the development and implementation of risk management processes and controls across AIG’s operations, including by establishing review and oversight committees to monitor risks, setting limits and identifying risk mitigating strategies and techniques. Nonetheless, these procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating risk exposure in all market conditions, some of which change rapidly and severely. A failure of AIG’s risk management processes or the ineffectiveness of AIG’s risk mitigating strategies and techniques could adversely affect, perhaps materially, AIG’s consolidated results of operations, liquidity or financial condition, result in regulatory action or litigation or damage AIG’s reputation. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management.   Liquidity    AIG’s liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen significant outflows of cash. This situation may arise due to circumstances that AIG may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or AIG. In addition, this situation may arise due to circumstances specific to AIG, such as a decline in its credit ratings. AIG depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund payments on AIG’s obligations, including debt obligations. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit AIG’s ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries. In particular, many of AIG’s subsidiaries, including AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to the parent holding company, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder AIG’s ability to access funds that AIG may need to make payments on its obligations. See also Item 1. Business — Regulation.   Some of AIG’s investments are relatively illiquid and would be difficult to sell, or to sell at acceptable prices, if AIG required cash in amounts greater than its customary needs. AIG’s investments in certain securities, including certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited partnerships, hedge funds, mortgage loans, flight equipment, finance receivables and real estate are relatively illiquid. These asset classes represented approximately 23 percent of the carrying value of AIG’s total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2007. In addition, the current disruption in the credit markets has affected the liquidity of other AIG portfolios     16 AIG 2007 Form 10-K    Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             including the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If AIG requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements or is required to post or return collateral in connection with its investment portfolio, derivative transactions or securities lending activities, then AIG may have difficulty selling these investments or terminating these transactions in a timely manner or may be forced to sell or terminate them for less than what AIG might otherwise have been able to, or both. Although AIGFP has no current intent to do so, if AIGFP sells or closes out its derivative transactions prior to maturity, the effect could be significant to AIG’s overall liquidity.   AIG’s liquidity may be adversely affected by requirements to post collateral. Certain of the credit default swaps written by AIGFP contain collateral posting requirements. The amount of collateral required to be posted for most of these transactions is determined based on the value of the security or loan referenced in the documentation for the credit default swap. Continued declines in the values of these referenced securities or loans will increase the amount of collateral AIGFP must post which could impair AIG’s liquidity.   See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity — Liquidity.   Investment Concentration    Concentration of AIG’s investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects. Any concentration of AIG’s investment portfolios in any particular industry, group of related industries, asset classes, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities, or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on the investment portfolios and consequently on AIG’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition. While AIG seeks to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated. Further, AIG’s ability to sell assets relating to such particular groups of related assets may be limited if other market participants are seeking to sell at the same time.   Credit Ratings    Ratings actions regarding AIG could adversely affect AIG’s business and its consolidated results of operations. Following AIG’s filing with the SEC on February 11, 2008 of a Current Report on Form 8-K regarding the valuation of AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio and reporting the conclusion by AIG’s independent auditors that AIG had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and oversight relating to this valuation, the following credit rating actions were taken:           •   Standard & Poor’s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P) affirmed its ‘AA’ counterparty credit ratings on AIG and its ‘AA+’ counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on AIG’s core subsidiaries, but revised the rating outlook to negative. In addition, S&P revised its rating outlook on ILFC’s corporate credit rating (AA-) to negative. A negative ratings outlook by S&P indicates that a rating may be lowered, but is not necessarily a precursor of a ratings change.     •   Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) changed its rating outlook for AIG and its subsidiaries that have substantial exposure to the U.S. subprime mortgage market or whose ratings rely on significant explicit or implicit support from AIG to negative. Moody’s rates AIG ‘Aa2’ and nearly all of its insurance subsidiaries either ‘Aa1’ or ‘Aa2’. A negative ratings outlook by Moody’s indicates that a rating may be lowered, but is not necessarily a precursor of a ratings change.     •   Fitch Ratings (Fitch) placed AIG’s and its subsidiaries’ long-term debt ratings (AA), including ILFC (A+) and AGF (A+), on Rating Watch Negative. Rating Watch Negative indicates that a rating has been placed on active rating watch status. Fitch indicated that it expects to resolve the Rating Watch after it reviews AIG’s 2007 audited financial statements.     •   A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best) placed most of its financial strength and issuer credit ratings on AIG’s domestic Life Insurance and Retirement Services (A++) and Domestic General Insurance subsidiaries (including Transatlantic) (A+), as well as AIG’s issuer credit rating (AA), under review with negative implications. A.M. Best indicated that following a detailed review of AIG’s 2007 audited financial statements and further discussion with AIG management, it will re-evaluate the “under review” rating status.    Financial strength and credit ratings by the major ratings agencies are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and other financial institutions and affect the availability and cost of borrowings. Financial strength ratings measure an insurance company’s ability to meet its obligations to contract holders and policyholders, help to maintain public confidence in a company’s products, facilitate marketing of products and enhance a company’s competitive position. Credit ratings measure a company’s ability to repay its obligations and directly affect the cost and availability to that company of unsecured financing. AIG’s ratings have historically provided it with a competitive advantage. However, a ratings downgrade could adversely affect AIG’s business and its consolidated results of operations in a number of ways, including:           •   increasing AIG’s interest expense;     •   reducing AIGFP’s ability to compete in the structured products and derivatives businesses;     •   reducing the competitive advantage of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, which may result in reduced product sales;     •   adversely affecting relationships with agents and sales representatives;     •   in the case of a downgrade of AGF or ILFC, increasing their interest expense and reducing their ability to compete in their respective businesses; and     •   triggering the application of a termination provision in certain of AIG’s contracts, principally agreements entered into by AIGFP and assumed reinsurance contracts entered into by Transatlantic.     AIG 2007 Form 10-K   17    Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             In the event of a downgrade of AIG, AIG would be required to post additional collateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of business on February 14, 2008, based on AIG’s outstanding municipal GIAs and financial derivatives transactions as of such date, a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings to Aa3 by Moody’s or AA- by S&P would permit counterparties to call for approximately $1.39 billion of additional collateral. Further, additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral, which could have a material effect on how AIG manages its liquidity. For a further discussion of AIG’s credit ratings and the potential effect of posting collateral on AIG’s liquidity, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity — Credit Ratings and — Liquidity.   Catastrophe Exposures    The occurrence of catastrophic events could adversely affect AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemic disease, acts of terrorism and other catastrophes could adversely affect AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations, including by exposing AIG’s businesses to the following:           •   widespread claim costs associated with property, workers compensation, mortality and morbidity claims;     •   loss resulting from the value of invested assets declining to below the amount required to meet the policy and contract liabilities; and     •   loss resulting from actual policy experience emerging adversely in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing related to mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses.    Reinsurance    Reinsurance may not be available or affordable. AIG subsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and utilize reinsurance as part of AIG’s overall risk management strategy. Reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention, and to mitigate losses that may arise from catastrophes. Market conditions beyond AIG’s control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance purchased by AIG subsidiaries. For example, reinsurance may be more difficult to obtain after a year with a large number of major catastrophes. Accordingly, AIG may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, in which case AIG would have to accept an increase in exposure risk, reduce the amount of business written by its subsidiaries or seek alternatives.   Reinsurance subjects AIG to the credit risk of its reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect AIG against losses. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to the AIG subsidiary to the extent the risk is ceded subject to the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contracts in place, it does not relieve the AIG subsidiary of the primary liability to its policyholders. Accordingly, AIG bears credit risk with respect to its subsidiaries’ reinsurers to the extent not mitigated by collateral or other credit enhancements. A reinsurer’s insolvency or inability or refusal to make timely payments under the terms of its agreements with the AIG subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s results of operations and liquidity. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Reinsurance.   Adjustments to Life Insurance & Retirement Services Deferred Policy  Acquisition Costs    Interest rate fluctuations and other events may require AIG subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) which could adversely affect AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. DAC represents the costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts. When interest rates rise, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns, requiring AIG subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of DAC. To the extent such amortization exceeds surrender or other charges earned upon surrender and withdrawals of certain life insurance policies and annuity contracts, AIG’s results of operations could be negatively affected.   DAC for both insurance-oriented and investment-oriented products as well as retirement services products is reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If the actual emergence of future profitability were to be substantially lower than estimated, AIG could be required to accelerate its DAC amortization and such acceleration could adversely affect AIG’s results of operations. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 1 and 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Use of Estimates    If actual experience differs from management’s estimates used in the preparation of financial statements, AIG’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. AIG considers that its accounting policies that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore viewed as critical accounting estimates, are those described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. For example, recent market volatility and declines in liquidity have made it more difficult to value certain of AIG’s invested assets and the obligations and collateral relating to certain financial instruments issued or held by AIG, such as     18 AIG 2007 Form 10-K    Table of Contents  American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             AIGFP’s super senior credit default swap portfolio. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, AIG’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition would be directly affected, perhaps materially.   Legal Proceedings    Significant legal proceedings may adversely affect AIG’s results of operations. AIG is party to numerous legal proceedings and regulatory or governmental investigations. It is possible that the effect of these unresolved matters could be material to AIG’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. For a discussion of these unresolved matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.   Foreign Operations    Foreign operations expose AIG to risks that may affect its operations, liquidity and financial condition. AIG provides insurance, investment and other financial products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services business is conducted outside the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly those in developing nations, may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect other AIG operations.   The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as its subsidiaries operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIG’s insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect AIG’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG’s net financial exposure at that time in that country.   Regulation    AIG is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which it conducts its businesses. AIG’s operations around the world are subject to regulation by different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. AIG’s operations have become more diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In particular, AIG’s consumer lending business is subject to a broad array of laws and regulations governing lending practices and permissible loan terms, and AIG would expect increased regulatory oversight relating to this business.   The regulatory environment could have a significant effect on AIG and its businesses. Among other things, AIG could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of its business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on its business activities. Significant regulatory action against AIG could have material adverse financial effects, cause significant reputational harm or harm business prospects. New laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to clients may also adversely affect AIG and its businesses.   A Material Weakness    A material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and oversight relating to the AIGFP valuation of its super senior credit default swap portfolio could adversely affect the accuracy or timing of future regulatory filings. AIG’s management has concluded that a material weakness relating to the internal control over financial reporting and oversight relating to the fair value valuation of the AIGFP super senior credit default swap portfolio existed as of December 31, 2007. Until remediated, this weakness could adversely affect the accuracy or timing of future filings with the SEC and other regulatory authorities. A discussion of this material weakness and AIG’s remediation efforts can be found in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures — Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.   Employee Error and Misconduct    Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses. Losses may result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.   There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and AIG runs the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the controls that AIG has in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.   Aircraft Suppliers    There are limited suppliers of aircraft and engines. The supply of jet transport aircraft, which ILFC purchases and leases, is dominated by two airframe manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus, and a limited number of engine manufacturers. As a result, ILFC is dependent on the manufacturers’ success in remaining financially stable, producing aircraft and related components which meet the airlines’ demands, both in type and quantity, and fulfilling their contractual obligations to ILFC. Competition between the manufacturers for market share is intense and may lead to instances of deep discounting for certain aircraft types and could negatively affect ILFC’s competitive pricing.
