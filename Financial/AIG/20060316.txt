Item 1A. Risk Factors.     12   AIG  -  Form 10-K        AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES           Regulation   AIG’s operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. The regulatory environment can have a significant effect on AIG and its business. AIG’s operations have become more diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In addition, the investigations into financial accounting practices that led to the Restatements of AIG’s financial statements have heightened regulatory scrutiny of AIG worldwide.   Certain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate services and transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG’s subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states that have such requirements. See also Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk-based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   In connection with the Restatements, AIG undertook to examine and evaluate each of the items that have been restated or adjusted in its consolidated GAAP financial statements to determine whether restatement of the previously filed statutory financial statements of its insurance company subsidiaries would be required. AIG completed its 2004 audited statutory financial statements for all of the Domestic General Insurance companies in late 2005. The statutory accounting treatment of the various items requiring adjustment or restatement were reviewed and agreed to with the relevant state insurance regulators in advance of the filings. Adjustments necessary to reflect the cumulative effect on statutory surplus of adjustments relating to years prior to 2004 were made to 2004 opening surplus, and 2004 statutory net income was restated accordingly. Previously reported General Insurance statutory surplus at December 31, 2004 was reduced by approximately $3.5 billion to approximately $20.6 billion.   AIG also recently completed its 2005 unaudited statutory financial statements for all of the Domestic General Insurance companies, again after reviewing and agreeing with the relevant state insurance regulators the statutory accounting treatment of various items. The state regulators have permitted the Domestic General Insurance companies to record a $724 million reduction to opening statutory surplus as of January 1, 2005, to reflect the effects of the Second Restatement. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — “Capital Resources — Regulation and Supervision” herein.   AIG has taken various steps to enhance the capital positions of the Domestic General Insurance companies. AIG entered into capital maintenance agreements with the Domestic General Insurance companies that set forth procedures through which AIG will provide ongoing capital support. Dividends from the Domestic General Insurance companies were suspended in the fourth quarter of 2005. AIG contributed an additional $750 million of capital into American Home effective September 30, 2005, and contributed a further $2.25 billion of capital in February 2006 for a total of approximately $3 billion of capital into Domestic General Insurance subsidiaries effective December 31, 2005. Furthermore, in order to allow the Domestic General Insurance companies to record as an admitted asset at December 31, 2005 certain reinsurance ceded to non-U.S. reinsurers (which has the effect of increasing the statutory surplus of such Domestic General Insurance companies), AIG has obtained, and entered into reimbursement agreements for $1.5 billion of letters of credit issued by several commercial banks in favor of certain Domestic General Insurance companies.   AIG’s insurance operations are currently under review by various state regulatory agencies. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a further description of these investigations and see “Risk Factors – Regulatory Investigations” in Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information on their application to AIG’s insurance businesses.   Risk-Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified.   The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of statutory surplus by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer’s size, but also on the risk profile of the insurer’s operations.   The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for    AIG  -  Form 10-K     13                 corrective action to placing the insurer under regulatory control.   The statutory surplus of each of AIG’s domestic general and life insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC standards as of December 31, 2005.   To the extent that any of AIG’s insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of surplus, it would be AIG’s intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity.   A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions.   In addition to licensing requirements, AIG’s foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the state, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms which may not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.   In 1999, AIG became a unitary thrift holding company when the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) granted AIG approval to organize AIG Federal Savings Bank. Annually, the OTS conducts an examination of AIG. The OTS examination involves assessing the organization’s overall risk profile.   Competition   AIG’s Insurance, Financial Services and Asset Management businesses operate in a highly competitive environment, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are insurance companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions.   The insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,100 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG’s subsidiaries offering Life Insurance and Retirement Services compete in the United States with approximately 2,000 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers, global insurance groups, and local companies in particular areas in which they are active.   AIG’s strong ratings have historically provided a competitive advantage. The effect on the business of AIG of recent regulatory investigations, the Restatements, and subsequent ratings actions is currently unknown, but these developments may adversely affect the competitive position of AIG and its subsidiaries. See “Risk Factors — AIG Credit Ratings” in Item 1A. Risk Factors.   ITEM 1A.   Risk Factors   AIG’s Credit Ratings   The downgrades in AIG’s credit ratings will increase AIG’s borrowing costs, may lessen AIG’s ability to compete in certain businesses and will require AIG to post additional collateral.   From March through June of 2005, the major rating agencies downgraded AIG’s ratings in a series of actions. Standard & Poor’s, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), lowered the long-term senior debt and counterparty ratings of AIG from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA’ and changed the rating outlook to negative. Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) lowered AIG’s long-term senior debt rating from ‘Aaa’ to ‘Aa2’ and changed the outlook to stable. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) downgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of AIG from ‘AAA’ to ‘AA’ and placed the ratings on Rating Watch Negative.   The agencies also took rating actions on AIG’s insurance subsidiaries. S&P and Fitch lowered to ‘AA+’ the insurance financial strength ratings of most of AIG’s insurance companies. Moody’s lowered the insurance financial strength ratings generally to either ‘Aa1’ or ‘Aa2’. A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength ratings for most of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries from ‘A++’ to ‘A+’ and the issuer credit ratings from ‘aa+’ to ‘aa-’. Many of these companies’ ratings remain on a negative watch.   In addition, S&P changed the outlook on ILFC’s ‘AA-’ long-term senior debt rating to negative. Moody’s affirmed ILFC’s long-term and short-term senior debt ratings (‘A1’/‘P-1’). Fitch downgraded ILFC’s long-term senior debt rating from ‘AA-’ to ‘A+’ and placed the rating on Rating Watch Negative and downgraded ILFC’s short-term debt rating from ‘F1+’ to ‘F1’. Fitch also placed the ‘A+’ long-term senior debt ratings of American General Finance Corporation and American General Finance, Inc. on Rating Watch Negative. S&P and Moody’s affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of American General Finance Corporation at ‘A+’/‘A-1’ and ‘A1’/‘P-1’, respectively.   These debt and financial strength ratings are current opinions of the rating agencies. As such, they may be changed, suspended or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or based on other circumstances. Ratings may also be withdrawn at AIG management’s request. This discussion of ratings is not a complete list of ratings of AIG and its subsidiaries.     14   AIG  -  Form 10-K        AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES           These ratings actions have affected and will continue to affect AIG’s business and results of operations in a number of ways.         -    Downgrades in AIG’s debt ratings will adversely affect AIG’s results of operations. AIG relies on external sources of financing to fund several of its operations. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are generally dependent on the issuer’s long-term and short-term debt ratings. These downgrades and any future downgrades in AIG’s debt ratings may adversely affect AIG’s borrowing costs and therefore adversely affect AIG’s results of operations.     -    The downgrade in AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings will adversely affect AIGFP’s ability to compete for certain businesses. Credit ratings are very important to the ability of financial institutions to compete in the derivative and structured transaction marketplaces. Historically, AIG’s triple-A ratings provided AIGFP a competitive advantage. The downgrades have reduced this advantage and, for specialized financial transactions that generally are conducted only by triple-A rated financial institutions, counterparties may be unwilling to transact business with AIGFP except on a secured basis. This could require AIGFP to post more collateral to counterparties in the future. See below for a further discussion of the effect that posting collateral may have on AIG’s liquidity.     -    Although the financial strength ratings of AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries remain high compared to many of their competitors, the downgrades have reduced the previous ratings differential. The competitive advantage of the ratings to AIG’s insurance company subsidiaries may be lessened accordingly.     -    As a result of the downgrades of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings, AIG was required to post approximately $1.16 billion of collateral with counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial derivatives transactions. In the event of a further downgrade, AIG will be required to post additional collateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of business on February 28, 2006 based on AIG’s outstanding municipal guaranteed investment agreements and financial derivatives transactions as of such date, a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings to ‘Aa3’ by Moody’s or ‘AA-’ by S&P would permit counterparties to call for approximately $962 million of additional collateral. Further, additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral, which could have a material effect on how AIG manages its liquidity. The actual amount of additional collateral that AIG would be required to post to counterparties in the event of such downgrades depends on market conditions, the market value of the outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at the time of the downgrade. Any additional obligations to post collateral will increase the demand on AIG’s liquidity.     Regulatory Investigations   Significant legal proceedings have adversely affected AIG’s results of operations for 2005. As a result of the settlements discussed below under Item 3. Legal Proceedings, AIG recorded an after-tax charge of approximately $1.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. AIG is party to numerous other legal proceedings and regulatory investigations. It is possible that the effect of the unresolved matters could be material to AIG’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. For a discussion of these unresolved matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.   Significant investigations into AIG’s business are continuing and the commencement of additional investigations is possible. Broad-ranging investigations into AIG’s business practices continue. These investigations are being conducted by a number of regulators, and related actions by regulators both within and outside the United States may be undertaken in response. The review of large amounts of information by various regulatory authorities may result in the commencement of new areas of inquiry and, possibly, new significant legal proceedings.   The Relationships Between AIG and Starr and SICO   The relationships between AIG and Starr and SICO may take an extended period of time to unwind and/or resolve, and the consequences of such resolution are uncertain. Although AIG is currently working on unwinding and resolving its relationships with C.V. Starr & Co, Inc. (Starr) and Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO), AIG cannot predict what its future relationship with Starr and SICO will be. AIG subsidiaries are in the process of terminating their agency relationships with the Starr agencies and are beginning to write the business previously produced by those agencies on a direct basis. AIG also continues to address the issues posed by compensation plans and programs previously provided to AIG executives by Starr and SICO, as AIG is providing compensation programs that recognize those plans and programs. In January 2006, Starr announced that it had completed its tender offers to purchase interests in Starr and that all eligible shareholders had tendered their shares. As a result of completion of the tender offers, no AIG executive currently holds any Starr interest. AIG has entered into agreements pursuant to which AIG agrees, subject to certain conditions, to assure AIG’s current employees that all payments are made under a series of two-year Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans provided by SICO (SICO Plans). See Note 12(f) and Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that AIG will be able to effectively address the consequences for its executives of the unwinding of their participation in the Starr and SICO plans and programs. Nor can there be any assurance that AIG will compete successfully for the business previously produced by the Starr agencies.   Finally, litigation between AIG and Starr and SICO remains pending, and the timing and terms of any resolution cannot currently be predicted. As a result of the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of AIG’s relationships with Starr and SICO will not be adverse to AIG. For further information about litigation between AIG and Starr and SICO, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.    AIG  -  Form 10-K     15                 Certain Material Weaknesses   Management identified three remaining material weaknesses in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting. Remediation of these material weaknesses is ongoing. Until these weaknesses are remediated, the weaknesses could affect the accuracy or timing of future filings with the SEC and other regulatory authorities. A discussion of these material weaknesses and AIG’s remediation efforts can be found in Item 9A of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Access to Capital Markets   AIG’s access to the U.S. public capital markets may be delayed by the SEC registration process. Although AIG is able to access the Rule 144A and Euro markets, AIG will be unable to access the U.S. public securities markets until it has filed and the SEC has declared effective a new registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. Depending upon the SEC’s review of these filings, this process may take several months or more.   Unless relief is granted by the SEC, AIG will not be able to avail itself of certain favorable provisions of the Securities Act. AIG will not, for a period of three years, be a “well-known seasoned issuer”. During this period, AIG’s ability to communicate with respect to new product offerings and to structure client products will be more limited than they otherwise would. In addition, during this period, AIG will not be able to avail itself of provisions that allow for an automatically effective shelf registration statement or rely on the “forward-looking statements” safe harbor under the securities laws in providing forward-looking information to investors.   Foreign Operations   Foreign operations expose AIG to risks that may affect its operations, liquidity and financial conditions. AIG provides insurance and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses are conducted outside the United States. Operations outside of the United States may be affected by regional economic downturns, political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect other AIG operations.   The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIG’s insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIG’s international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments including tax changes, regulatory restrictions and nationalization of AIG’s operations without compensation. Adverse affects resulting from any one country may affect AIG’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG’s net financial exposure at that time in that country.   Liquidity   Payments from subsidiaries may be limited by regulators. AIG depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from AIG’s subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund payments on AIG’s obligations, including debt obligations. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit AIG’s ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from AIG’s subsidiaries. In particular, many of AIG’s subsidiaries, including AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to the parent holding company, or that prohibit such transfer altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder AIG’s ability to access funds that AIG may need to make payments on AIG’s obligations.   Regulation   AIG is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which it conducts its businesses. AIG’s operations around the world are subject to regulation by different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. AIG’s operations have become more diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In particular, AIG’s consumer lending business is subject to a broad array of laws and regulations governing lending practices and permissible loan terms, and AIG would expect increased regulatory oversight relating to this business.   The regulatory environment could have a significant effect on AIG and its businesses. Among other things, AIG could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of its business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on its business activities. Significant regulatory action against AIG could have material adverse financial effects, cause significant reputational harm, or harm business prospects. New laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to clients may also adversely affect AIG and its businesses. See Item 1. Business — “Regulation.”     16   AIG  -  Form 10-K        AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES           Casualty Insurance Underwriting and Reserves   Casualty insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss expenses. Although AIG annually reviews the adequacy of the established reserve for losses and loss expenses, there can be no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG’s current loss reserves. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty lines of business, which include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general liability, products liability and related classes, as well as for asbestos and environmental exposures. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential for reserves with respect to a number of years to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation in labor and material costs or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic phenomena affecting claims. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Operating Review — Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses.”   Natural Disasters and Pandemic Diseases   Natural disasters and pandemic disease could adversely affect AIG’s operating results. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect AIG’s operating results. Other risks, such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease, such as the Avian Influenza A Virus (H5N1), could adversely affect AIG’s business and operating results to an extent that may be only minimally offset by reinsurance programs.   While to date outbreaks of the Avian Flu continue to occur among poultry or wild birds in a number of countries in Asia, parts of Europe, and recently in Africa, transmission to humans has been rare. If the virus mutates to a form that can be transmitted from human to human, it has the potential to spread rapidly worldwide. If such an outbreak were to take place, early quarantine and vaccination could be critical to containment.   Both the contagion and mortality rate of any mutated H5N1 virus that can be transmitted from human to human are highly speculative. AIG continues to monitor the developing facts. A significant global outbreak could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s life insurance business operating results and liquidity from increased mortality and morbidity rates.   ITEM 1B.
