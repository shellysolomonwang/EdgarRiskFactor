Item 1A. Risk Factors — Business and Regulation and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the AerCap Transaction.      A REVIEW OF LIABILITY FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE     The liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense represents the accumulation of estimates for unpaid reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR) for AIG Property Casualty and UGC. Unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses are also referred to as unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, or just loss reserves.  We recognize as assets the portion of this liability that will be recovered from reinsurers. Reserves are discounted, where permitted, in accordance with U.S. GAAP.   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  18                Table of Contents    ITEM 1 / BUSINESS       The Loss Reserve Development Process  The process of establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense is complex and imprecise because it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events. As a result, informed subjective estimates and judgments about our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process.             We use a number of techniques to analyze the adequacy of the established net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense (net loss reserves). Using these analytical techniques, we monitor the adequacy of AIG's established reserves and determine appropriate assumptions for inflation and other factors influencing loss costs. Our analysis also takes into account emerging specific development patterns, such as case reserve redundancies or deficiencies and IBNR emergence. We also consider specific factors that may impact losses, such as changing trends in medical costs, unemployment levels and other economic indicators, as well as changes in legislation and social attitudes that may affect decisions to file claims or the magnitude of court awards. See Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates for a description of our loss reserving process.   A significant portion of AIG Property Casualty's business is in the U.S. commercial casualty class, including asbestos and environmental, which tends to involve longer periods of time for the reporting and settlement of claims and may increase the risk and uncertainty with respect to our loss reserve development.     Because reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in prior year estimates are unavoidable in the insurance industry. These changes in estimates are sometimes referred to as "loss development" or "reserve development."          Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development  The "Analysis of Consolidated Loss Reserve Development" table presents the development of prior year net loss reserves for calendar years 2003 through 2013 for each balance sheet in that period. The information in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This table should be interpreted with care by those not familiar with its format or those who are familiar with other loss development analyses arranged in an accident year or underwriting year basis rather than the balance sheet, as shown below. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The top row of the table shows Net Reserves Held (the net liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses) at each balance sheet date, net of discount. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all years prior to the balance sheet date that were unpaid as of that balance sheet date, including estimates for IBNR claims. The amount of loss reserve discount included in the net reserves at each date is shown immediately below the net reserves held. The undiscounted reserve at each date is equal to the sum of the discount and the net reserves held. For example, Net Reserves Held (Undiscounted) was $37.7 billion at December 31, 2003.  The next section of the table shows the original Net Undiscounted Reserves re-estimated over 10 years. This re-estimation takes into consideration a number of factors, including changes in the estimated frequency of reported claims, effects of significant judgments, the emergence of latent exposures, and changes in medical cost trends. For example, the original undiscounted reserve of $37.7 billion at December 31, 2003, was re-estimated to $62.1 billion at December 31, 2013. The amount of the development related to losses settled or re-estimated in 2013, but incurred in 2010, is included in the cumulative development amount for years 2010, 2011 and 2012. Any increase or decrease in the estimate is reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimate is changed.  The middle of the table shows Net Redundancy (Deficiency). This is the aggregate change in estimates over the period of years covered by the table. For example, the net loss reserve deficiency of $24.4 billion for 2003 is the difference between the original undiscounted reserve of $37.7 billion at December 31, 2003 and the $62.1 billion of re-estimated reserves at December 31, 2013. The net deficiency amounts are cumulative; in other words, the amount   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  19      Table of Contents   ITEM 1 / BUSINESS  shown in the 2012 column includes the amount shown in the 2011 column, and so on. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.  The bottom portion of the table shows the Paid (Cumulative) amounts during successive years related to the undiscounted loss reserves. For example, as of December 31, 2013, AIG had paid a total of $51.6 billion of the $62.1 billion in re-estimated reserves for 2003, resulting in Remaining Reserves (Undiscounted) of $10.5 billion for 2003. Also included in this section are the Remaining Reserves (Undiscounted) and the  Remaining Discount for each year.  The following table presents loss reserves and the related loss development 2003 through 2013 and consolidated gross liability (before discount), reinsurance recoverable and net liability recorded for each calendar year, and the re-estimation of these amounts as of December 31, 2013.(a)                                                                                                     (in millions)

sold 21st Century Insurance Group and HSB Group, Inc. The sales and deconsolidation are reflected in the table above as a reduction in December 31, 2009 net reserves of $9.7 billion and as an $8.6 billion increase in paid losses for the years 2000 through 2008 to remove the reserves for these divested entities from the ending balance.  (b) The increase in Net Reserves Held from 2009 to 2010 is partially due to the $1.7 billion in Net Reserves Held by Fuji, which was acquired in 2010. The decrease in 2011 is due to the cession of asbestos reserves described in Item 7. MD&A — Results of Operations — Segment Results — AIG Property Casualty Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense — Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.   The Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense as reported in AIG's Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2013 differs from the total reserve reported in the annual statements filed with state insurance departments and, where applicable, with foreign regulatory authorities primarily for the following reasons:  •Reserves for certain foreign operations are not required or permitted to be reported in the United States for statutory reporting purposes, including contingency reserves for catastrophic events;   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  20      Table of Contents   ITEM 1 / BUSINESS   •Statutory practices in the United States require reserves to be shown net of applicable reinsurance recoverable; and   •Unlike statutory financial statements, AIG's consolidated Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense excludes the effect of intercompany transactions.  Gross loss reserves are calculated without reduction for reinsurance recoverables and represent the accumulation of estimates for reported losses and IBNR, net of estimated salvage and subrogation. We review the adequacy of established gross loss reserves in the manner previously described for net loss reserves. A reconciliation of activity in the Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense is included in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  For further discussion of asbestos and environmental reserves, see Item 7. MD&A — Results of Operations — Segment Results — AIG Property Casualty Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense — Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.      REINSURANCE ACTIVITIES     Reinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes.  AIG subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we are required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.  Over the last several years, AIG Property Casualty revised its ceded reinsurance framework and strategy to improve capital management and support our global product line risk and profitability objectives. As a result of adopting the revised framework and strategy, many individual reinsurance contracts were consolidated into more efficient global programs and reinsurance ceded to third parties in support of risk and capital management objectives has decreased for the full year 2013 compared to the prior year. There are many different forms of reinsurance agreements and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives. We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of various reinsurance markets and arrangements that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives.  Reinsurance markets include:  •Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including in the United States, Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;  •Capital markets through investors in insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, "sidecars" (special purpose entities that allow investors to take on the risk of a book of business from an insurance company in exchange for a premium) and similar vehicles; and   •Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance and/or engage in swaps.  The form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking (i) proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and losses to reinsurers, or non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis and (ii) treaties that cover a defined book of policies, or facultative placements that cover an individual policy. The vast majority of our reinsurance is non-proportional.  Reinsurance arrangements do not relieve AIG subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.  In certain markets, we are required to participate on a proportional basis in reinsurance pools based on our relative share of direct writings in those markets. Such mandatory reinsurance generally covers higher-risk consumer exposures such as assigned-risk automobile and earthquake, as well as certain commercial exposures such as workers' compensation.   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  21      Table of Contents   ITEM 1 / BUSINESS  We continued our strategy to take advantage of the pricing differential between traditional reinsurance markets and capital markets. On July 9, 2013, we entered into a five-year catastrophe bond transaction with Tradewynd Re Ltd., which will provide $125 million of indemnity protection against U.S., Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico named storms, and U.S. and Canadian earthquakes. The transaction provides us with fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per-occurrence basis through June 2018.  In addition, we entered into a five-year capital markets reinsurance transaction, effective as of January 1, 2014 with Tradewynd Re Ltd., which will provide $400 million of indemnity reinsurance protection against U.S., Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico named storms, and U.S. and Canadian earthquakes. To fund its potential obligations to AIG, Tradewynd Re Ltd. issued three tranches of notes, one with a one-year term and two with three-year terms. The transaction closed December 18, 2013 and provides AIG with fully collateralized coverage against losses from the events described above on a per-occurrence basis through December 2018.  See Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Insurance Operations Risks — AIG Property Casualty Key Insurance Risks — Reinsurance Recoverable for a summary of significant reinsurers.      GENERATING REVENUES: INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS                AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement generally receive premiums and deposits well in advance of paying covered claims or benefits. In the intervening periods, we invest these premiums and deposits to generate net investment income that is available to pay claims or benefits. As a result, we generate significant revenues from insurance investment activities.  AIG's worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in fixed maturity securities of corporations, municipal bonds and government issuances in all of its portfolios, and, to a lesser extent, investments in high-yield bonds, common stock, real estate, hedge funds and other alternative investments.     We generate significant revenues in our AIG Property Casualty and AIG Life and Retirement operations from investment activities.     The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities at AIG consist of intermediate and long duration fixed maturity securities.  AIG Property Casualty — Fixed maturity securities held by the insurance companies included in AIG Property Casualty domestic operations have historically consisted primarily of laddered holdings of corporate bonds, municipal bonds and government bonds. These investments provided attractive returns and limited credit risk. To meet our domestic operations' current risk return and business objectives, our domestic property and casualty companies have been shifting investment allocations to a broader array of debt, including structured securities and equity sectors. Our fixed maturity securities must meet our liquidity, duration and quality objectives as well as current capital, risk return and business objectives. Fixed maturity securities held by AIG Property Casualty international operations consist primarily of intermediate duration high-grade securities, primarily in the markets being served. In addition, AIG Property Casualty has redeployed cash in excess of operating needs and short-term investments into longer-term, higher-yielding securities.  AIG Life and Retirement — Our investment strategy is to largely match the duration of our liabilities with assets of comparable duration, to the extent practicable. AIG Life and Retirement primarily invests in a diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, including corporate bonds, RMBS, CMBS and CDO/ABS. To further diversify the portfolio, investments are made in private equity funds, hedge funds and affordable housing partnerships. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, for the three years ended December 31, 2013, they have achieved total returns in excess of AIG Life and Retirement's fixed maturity security returns. AIG Life and Retirement expects that these alternative investments will continue to outperform the fixed maturity security portfolio over the long term.   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  22      Table of Contents   ITEM 1 / BUSINESS  The following table summarizes the investment results of AIG's insurance operations.

See Item 7. MD&A — Results of Operations — AIG Property Casualty — AIG Property Casualty Net Investment Income and Net Realized Capital Gains (Losses).       REGULATION     Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, derivatives, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad.  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. The insurance and financial services industries generally have been subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and supervision in recent years.  The following table provides a general overview of our primary regulators and related bodies and a brief description of their oversight with respect to us and our subsidiaries, including key regulations or initiatives that we are currently, or may in the future be, subject to. Such regulations and initiatives, both in the United States and abroad, are discussed in more detail following the table.      U.S. Federal Regulation   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB): Oversees and regulates financial institutions, including non-bank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs). We are currently subject to the FRB's examination, supervision and enforcement authority, and reporting requirements, as an SLHC and as a SIFI.  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC): Charters, regulates and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations. The OCC supervises and regulates AIG Federal Savings Bank, our federal savings association subsidiary.  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Oversees and regulates the U.S. securities and security-based swap markets, U.S. mutual funds, U.S. broker-dealers and U.S. investment advisors. Principal regulator of the mutual funds offered by our broker-dealer subsidiaries owned by AIG Life and Retirement. The SEC is in the process of implementing rules and regulations governing reporting, execution and margin requirements for security-based swaps entered into within the U.S. Our security-based swap activities conducted by Global Capital Markets are subject to these rules and regulations.  Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): Oversees and regulates the U.S. swap, commodities and futures markets. The CFTC has implemented, and is in the process of implementing, rules and regulations governing reporting, execution and margin requirements for swaps entered into within the U.S. or by U.S. persons. Our swap activities conducted by Global Capital Markets are subject to these rules and regulations.  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank): Dodd-Frank has effected comprehensive changes to financial services regulation and subjects us, or will subject us, as applicable, to additional federal regulation, including:  •minimum capital requirements for SLHCs and insured depository institutions;   •enhanced prudential standards for SIFIs (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, stress tests and an early remediation regime process);  •prohibitions on proprietary trading; and  •increased regulation and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions.    AIG 2013 Form 10-K  23                Table of Contents    ITEM 1 / BUSINESS      U.S. State Regulation   State Insurance Regulators: Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and other jurisdictions in which they do business. Regulation is generally derived from statutes that delegate supervisory and regulatory powers to a state insurance regulator, and primarily relates to the insurer's financial condition, corporate conduct and market conduct activities.  NAIC Standards: The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is a standard-setting and regulatory support organization created and governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. The NAIC itself is not a regulator, but through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer review and coordinate regulatory oversight.      Foreign Regulation   Financial Stability Board (FSB): Consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The FSB itself is not a regulator, but it coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes implementation of regulatory, supervisory and other financial policies.  International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS): Represents insurance regulators and supervisors of more than 200 jurisdictions in nearly 140 countries and seeks to promote globally consistent insurance industry supervision. The IAIS itself is not a regulator, but the FSB has directed the IAIS to create standards on issues such as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk and corporate governance and incorporate them into IAIS' Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). The FSB also charged IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. Based on IAIS' assessment template, the FSB identified AIG as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII), which may subject us to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision, basic capital requirements and higher loss absorbency capital requirements. The IAIS is also developing ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. AIG currently meets the parameters set forth to define an IAIG.  European Union (EU): Certain financial services firms with regulated entities in the EU, such as us, are subject to supplementary supervision, which seeks to enable supervisors to perform consolidated banking supervision and insurance group supervision at the level of the ultimate parent entity. The objective of supplementary supervision is to detect, monitor, manage and control group risks. The UK Prudential Regulatory Authority, the United Kingdom's prudential regulator, is our EU supervisory coordinator. The EU has also established a set of regulatory requirements for EU derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) that include, among other things, risk mitigation, risk management and regulatory reporting, which are effective, and clearing requirements expected to become effective in 2014.  The EU's Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which is expected to become effective in 2016, includes minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then we could be subjected to Solvency II standards.  Regulation of Foreign Insurance Company Subsidiaries: Generally, our subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries also regulate rates on various types of policies.   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  24      Table of Contents   ITEM 1 / BUSINESS     Federal Reserve Supervision     We are regulated by the FRB and subject to its examination, supervision and enforcement authority and reporting requirements as a SLHC and as a SIFI.  We are a SLHC within the meaning of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA). Because we were grandfathered as a unitary SLHC within the meaning of HOLA when we organized AIG Federal Savings Bank and became a SLHC in 1999, we generally are not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which we may engage, as long as AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender.  Dodd-Frank has effected comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation. The FRB supervises and regulates SLHCs, and the OCC supervises and regulates federal savings associations, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and oversight bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process that has begun and is anticipated to continue over the next few years.  Changes mandated by Dodd-Frank include directing the FRB to promulgate minimum capital requirements for SLHCs. The FRB, the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have established revised minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements, which are based on accords established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, that apply to bank holding companies and SLHCs, as well as to insured depository institutions, such as AIG Federal Savings Bank. The requirements, however, do not apply to SLHCs that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activities. The FRB expects to implement a capital framework for SLHCs that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting activities by the time covered SLHCs must comply with the requirements in 2015.  As required by Dodd-Frank, the FRB has also proposed enhanced prudential standards (including minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements) for SIFIs and has stated its intention to propose enhanced prudential standards for SLHCs pursuant to HOLA. We cannot predict whether the capital regulations will be adopted as proposed or what enhanced prudential standards the FRB will promulgate for SLHCs, either generally or as applicable to insurance businesses. Further, we cannot predict how the FRB will exercise general supervisory authority over us as a SIFI, although the FRB could, as a prudential matter, for example, limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of AIG Common Stock or acquire or enter into other businesses. We cannot predict with certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how or whether Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact our businesses, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or require us to raise additional capital or result in a downgrade of our credit ratings.  On July 8, 2013, AIG received notice from the U.S. Treasury that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) has made a final determination that AIG should be supervised by the FRB as a SIFI pursuant to Dodd-Frank. As a SIFI, we are regulated by the FRB both in that capacity and, for as long as AIG continues to control an insured depository institution, in our capacity as a SLHC. The regulations applicable to SIFIs and to SLHCs, when all have been adopted as final rules, may differ materially from each other. AIG is working to restructure AIG Federal Savings Bank into a trust-only thrift and deregister AIG as a SLHC.  As a SIFI, we anticipate we will be subject to:  •stress tests to determine whether, on a consolidated basis, we have the capital necessary to absorb losses due to adverse economic conditions;  •stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of severe financial distress; and  •an early remediation regime process to be administered by the FRB.  Furthermore, if the Council were to make an additional separate determination that AIG poses a "grave threat" to U.S. financial stability, we would be required to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15:1 and the FRB may:  •limit our ability to merge with, acquire, consolidate with, or become affiliated with another company;   •restrict our ability to offer specified financial products;   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  25      Table of Contents   ITEM 1 / BUSINESS   •require us to terminate specified activities;  •impose conditions on how we conduct our activities; and  •with approval of the Council, and a determination that the foregoing actions are inadequate to mitigate a threat to U.S. financial stability, require us to sell or otherwise transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities.  As part of its general prudential supervisory powers, the FRB has the authority to limit our ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible for us to engage in if we do not satisfy certain requirements.      Volcker Rule     On December 10, 2013, the FRB, OCC, FDIC, SEC and CFTC adopted the final rule implementing Section 619 of Dodd-Frank, referred to as the "Volcker Rule." For as long as AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender, we and our affiliates are considered banking entities for purposes of the rule and, after the end of the rule's conformance period in July 2015 (subject to extension by the FRB until 2017), would be prohibited from "proprietary trading" and sponsoring or investing in "covered funds," subject to the rule's exceptions. The term "covered funds" includes hedge, private equity or similar funds and, in certain cases, issuers of asset-backed securities if such securities have equity-like characteristics. The Volcker Rule, as adopted, contains an exemption for proprietary trading and "covered fund" sponsorship or investment by a regulated insurance company or its affiliate for the general account of the regulated insurance company or a separate account established by the regulated insurance company. Even if we no longer control an insured depository institution, however, Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to subject SIFIs to additional capital requirements and quantitative limitations if they engage in activities prohibited for banking entities under the Volcker Rule.      Other Effects of Dodd-Frank     In addition, Dodd-Frank may also have the following effects on us:  •As a SIFI, we will be required to provide to regulators an annual plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, which must, among other things, ensure that AIG Federal Savings Bank is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities and meet several specific standards, including requiring a detailed resolution strategy and analyses of our material entities, organizational structure, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements.  •The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in.  •Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company whose largest United States subsidiary is an insurer (such as us) may be subject to a special liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code. That process is to be administered by the FDIC upon a coordinated determination by the Secretary of the Treasury, the director of the Federal Insurance Office and the FRB, in consultation with the FDIC, that such a financial company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability.  •Dodd-Frank provides for significantly increased regulation of and restrictions on derivatives markets and transactions that could affect various activities of AIG and its insurance and financial services subsidiaries, including (i) regulatory reporting for swaps (which are regulated by the CFTC) and security-based swaps (which are regulated by the SEC), (ii) mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated exchanges or electronic facilities for certain swaps and security-based swaps and (iii) margin and collateral requirements. Although the CFTC has not yet finalized certain requirements, many other requirements have taken effect, such as swap reporting, the mandatory clearing of certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps, and the mandatory trading of certain swaps on swap execution facilities or exchanges starting in February 2014. The SEC has proposed, but not yet finalized, rules with respect to the regulations and restrictions noted above. These regulations have affected and may further affect various activities of AIG and its insurance and financial services subsidiaries as rules are finalized to implement additional elements of the regulatory regime.   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  26      Table of Contents   ITEM 1 / BUSINESS   Similar regulations have been proposed or adopted outside the United States. For instance, the EU has also established a set of new regulatory requirements for EU derivatives activities under EMIR. These requirements include, among other things, various risk mitigation, risk management and regulatory reporting requirements that have already become effective and clearing requirements that are expected to become effective in 2014. These requirements could result in increased administrative costs with respect to our EU derivatives activities and overlapping or inconsistent regulation depending on the ultimate application of cross-border regulatory requirements between and among U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions.    •Dodd-Frank mandated a study to determine whether stable value contracts should be included in the definition of "swap." If that study concludes that stable value contracts are swaps, Dodd-Frank authorizes certain federal regulators to determine whether an exemption from the definition of a swap for stable value contracts is appropriate and in the public interest. Certain of our affiliates participate in the stable value contract business. We cannot predict what regulations might emanate from the aforementioned study or be promulgated applicable to this business in the future.  •Dodd-Frank established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the Department of the Treasury headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the Council . On December 12, 2013, the FIO released a Dodd-Frank mandated study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States. The report concluded that the uniformity and efficiency of the current state based regulatory system could be improved and highlighted areas in which Federal involvement is recommended. In the near-term, the FIO recommended that the states undertake reforms regarding capital adequacy, reform of insurer resolution practices, and marketplace regulation.  •Dodd-Frank established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as an independent agency within the FRB to regulate consumer financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes. Insurance products and services are not within the CFPB's general jurisdiction, although the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has since transferred authority to the CFPB to investigate mortgage insurance practices. Broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the CFPB's jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity.  •Title XIV of Dodd-Frank also restricts certain terms for mortgage loans, such as loan fees, prepayment fees and other charges, and imposes certain duties on a lender to ensure that a borrower can afford to repay the loan.  Dodd-Frank imposes various assessments on financial companies, including, as applicable to us, ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any borrowing and to cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the regulatory authority would have to take account of the amounts paid by us into state guaranty funds).  We cannot predict whether these actions will become effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and credit ratings. However, it is possible that such effect could be materially adverse. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Regulation for additional information.      Other Regulatory Developments     As described below, AIG has been designated as a Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII).  In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future. The FSB, consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly global systemically important financial institutions, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB has directed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the IAIS, headquartered in Basel, Switzerland) to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body's Insurance Core Principles (ICPs). IAIS's ICPs form the baseline threshold against which countries' financial services regulatory efforts in the insurance sector are measured. That measurement is made by periodic Financial Sector Assessment Program   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  27      Table of Contents   ITEM 1 / BUSINESS  (FSAP) reviews conducted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the reports thereon spur the development of country-specific additional or amended regulatory changes. Lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the Financial Services Agency in Japan, financial and banking regulation adopted in France and compensation regulations proposed or adopted by the financial regulators in Germany and the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority.  The FSB has also charged the IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. The IAIS has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which elements of the insurance sector, if any, could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector (e.g., commercial and investment banking, securities trading, etc.). The IAIS has provided its assessment template to the FSB. Based on this assessment template, on July 18, 2013, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national authorities, identified an initial list of G-SIIs, which includes AIG. The IAIS intends G-SIIs to be subject to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision, basic capital requirements and higher loss absorbency (HLA) capital requirements. The IAIS is currently developing a basic capital requirement (BCR), which it expects to finalize by the end of 2014. The BCR is expected to cover all group activities and could be implemented by national authorities as soon as 2015. The BCR will also serve as a foundation for the application of HLA capital requirements, which the IAIS intends to focus on non-traditional and non-insurance activities. It is expected that the IAIS will develop HLA capital requirements by the end of 2015 and the G-SII policy framework will be fully implemented by 2019.  The IAIS is also developing a ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. As currently delineated under the ComFrame, AIG meets the parameters set forth to define an IAIG. While we currently do not know when any ComFrame requirements will be finalized and become effective, the IAIS will undertake a field testing of the ComFrame, including the possibility of additional capital requirements for IAIGs, which is expected to commence in the beginning of 2014. It is expected that implementation of the ComFrame would begin in 2019.  Legislation in the European Union could also affect our international insurance operations. The Solvency II Directive (2009/138/EEC) (Solvency II), which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to become effective in 2016, reforms the insurance industry's solvency framework, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards. Solvency II is expected to be accompanied by Omnibus II, an EU proposal for a directive that also contains provisions for the capital treatment of products with long-term guarantees. Additionally, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority recently introduced interim guidelines effective January 1, 2014 that provide regulators in EU Member States with a framework to ensure that insurers make demonstrable progress towards meeting Solvency II requirements in 2016. The impact on us will depend on whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II; if the U.S. insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent, then we, along with other U.S.-based insurance companies, could be required to be supervised under Solvency II standards. Whether the U.S. insurance regulatory regime will be deemed "equivalent" is still under consideration by European authorities and remains uncertain, so we are not currently able to predict the impact of Solvency II.  We expect that the regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.      Regulation of Insurance Subsidiaries     Certain states and other jurisdictions require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such jurisdictions and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercompany services and transfers of assets, including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary, within the holding company system. Our subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those jurisdictions that have such requirements.  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  28      Table of Contents   ITEM 1 / BUSINESS  statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to the financial condition of the insurers and their corporate conduct and market conduct activities. This includes approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including with respect to risk-based capital, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies.  In the U.S., the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Virtually every state has adopted, in substantial part, the RBC Model Law promulgated by the NAIC, which allows states to act upon the results of RBC calculations, and provides for four incremental levels of regulatory action regarding insurers whose RBC calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those levels of action range from the requirement to submit a plan describing how an insurer would regain a calculated RBC ratio above the respective threshold through a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. The action thresholds are based on RBC levels that are calculated so that a company subject to such actions is solvent but its future solvency is in doubt without some type of corrective action. The RBC formula computes a risk-adjusted surplus level by applying discrete factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. These factors are developed to be risk-sensitive so that higher factors are applied to items exposed to greater risk. The statutory surplus of each of our U.S.-based life and property and casualty insurance subsidiaries exceeded RBC minimum required levels as of December 31, 2013.  If any of our insurance entities fell below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be our intention to provide appropriate capital or other types of support to that entity, under formal support agreements or capital maintenance agreements (CMAs) or otherwise. For additional details regarding CMAs that we have entered into with our insurance subsidiaries, see Item 7. MD&A — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries — AIG Property Casualty — AIG Life and Retirement and — Other Operations — Mortgage Guaranty.  The NAIC's Model Regulation "Valuation of Life Insurance Policies" (Regulation XXX) requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees (ULSGs). NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to these guarantees, including certain ULSGs. See Item 1A — Risk Factors and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for risks and additional information related to these statutory reserving requirements.  The NAIC has undertaken the Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) which focuses on a review of insurance solvency regulations throughout the U.S. financial regulatory system and is expected to lead to a set of long-term solvency modernization goals. SMI is broad in scope, but the NAIC has stated that its focus will include the U.S. solvency framework, group solvency issues, capital requirements, international accounting and regulatory standards, reinsurance and corporate governance.  A substantial portion of AIG Property Casualty's business is conducted in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, our subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements, licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and therefore these subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate.  In addition to licensing requirements, our foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, advertising, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of capital to be held, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local government, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including our subsidiaries, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.

AIG 2013 Form 10-K  32                Table of Contents    ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS     ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS    Investing in AIG involves risk. In deciding whether to invest in AIG, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. Any of these risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. They could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect AIG. These factors should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Further, many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.      MARKET CONDITIONS     Difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our businesses are highly dependent on the economic environment, both in the U.S. and around the world. Extreme market events, such as the global financial crisis during 2008 and 2009, have at times led, and could in the future lead, to a lack of liquidity, highly volatile markets, a steep depreciation in asset values across all classes, an erosion of investor and public confidence, and a widening of credit spreads. Concerns and events beyond our control, such as uncertainty as to the U.S. debt ceiling, the continued funding of the U.S. government, U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, the U.S. housing market, and concerns about European sovereign debt risk and the European banking industry, have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect liquidity, increase volatility, decrease asset prices, erode confidence and lead to wider credit spreads. Difficult economic conditions could also result in increased unemployment and a severe decline in business across a wide range of industries and regions. These market and economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Under difficult economic or market conditions, we could experience reduced demand for our products and an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Contract holders may choose to defer or cease paying insurance premiums. Other ways in which we could be negatively affected by economic conditions include, but are not limited to:  •declines in the valuation and performance of our investment portfolio, including declines attributable to rapid increases in interest rates;  •increased credit losses;  •declines in the value of other assets;  •impairments of goodwill and other long-lived assets;  •additional statutory capital requirements;  •limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;  •a decline in new business levels and renewals;  •a decline in insured values caused by a decrease in activity at client organizations;   •an increase in liability for future policy benefits due to loss recognition on certain long-duration insurance contracts;   •higher borrowing costs and more limited availability of credit;  •an increase in policy surrenders and cancellations; and  •a write-off of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC).  Sustained low interest rates may materially and adversely affect our profitability. Recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates relative to historical levels. Sustained low interest rates can negatively affect the performance of our investment securities and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  33      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  portfolios. If a low interest rate environment persists, we may experience slower investment income growth. Due to practical and capital markets limitations, we may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities. Continued low interest rates could also impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued.      INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS, INSURANCE AND OTHER EXPOSURES     The performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest rates. Our investment securities are subject to market risks and uncertainties. In particular, interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political issues and other factors beyond our control. Changes in monetary policy or other factors may cause interest rates to rise, which would adversely affect the value of the fixed income securities that we hold and could adversely affect our ability to sell these securities. In addition, the evaluation of available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairments, which may occur if interest rates rise, is a quantitative and qualitative process that is subject to significant management judgment. For a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain market risk factors, see Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Market Risk Management. Furthermore, our alternative investment portfolio includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through operating income and are therefore subject to significant volatility. In an economic downturn or declining market, the reduction in our investment income due to decreases in the fair value of alternative investments could have a material adverse effect on operating income.  Our investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy. Our results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our investment portfolio. We have concentrations in real estate and real estate-related securities, including residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage loans. We also have significant exposures to financial institutions and, in particular, to money center and global banks; U.S. state and local government issuers and authorities; PICC Group and PICC P&C, as a result of our strategic investments; and Euro Zone financial institutions, governments and corporations. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region may adversely affect our investments to the extent they are concentrated in such segments. Our ability to sell assets concentrated in such areas may be limited.  Concentration of our insurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects. We may be exposed to risks as a result of concentrations in our insurance policies, derivatives and other obligations that we undertake for customers and counterparties. We manage these concentration risks by monitoring the accumulation of our exposures by factors such as exposure type, industry, geographic region, counterparty and other factors. We also seek to use reinsurance, hedging and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures that exceed the limits we wish to retain. In certain circumstances, however, these risk management arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms or may prove to be ineffective for certain exposures. Also, our exposure may be so large that even a slightly adverse experience compared to our expectations may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition, or result in additional statutory capital requirements for our subsidiaries.  Our valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. During periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our investment securities if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be cases where certain assets in normally active markets with significant observable data become inactive with insufficient observable data due to the financial environment or market conditions in effect at that time. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. These values may not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the loan value of the asset and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value and/or an inability to realize that value in a market transaction or secured lending transaction may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  34      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS      RESERVES AND EXPOSURES     Our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events. Events such as hurricanes, windstorms, flooding, earthquakes, acts of terrorism, explosions and fires, cyber crimes, product defects, pandemic and other highly contagious diseases, mass torts and other catastrophes have adversely affected our business in the past and could do so in the future. In addition, we recognize the scientific consensus that climate change is a reality of increasing concern, indicated by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, a warming atmosphere and ocean, diminished snow and ice, and sea level rise. We understand that climate change potentially poses a serious financial threat to society as a whole, with implications for the insurance industry in areas such as catastrophe risk perception, pricing and modeling assumptions. Because there is significant variability associated with the impacts of climate change, we cannot predict how physical, legal, regulatory and social responses may impact our business.  Such catastrophic events, and any relevant regulations, could expose us to:  •widespread claim costs associated with property, workers' compensation, A&H, business interruption and mortality and morbidity claims;  •loss resulting from a decline in the value of our invested assets;  •limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;  •loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumptions made in product pricing;   •declines in value and/or losses with respect to companies and other entities whose securities we hold and counterparties we transact business with and have credit exposure to, including reinsurers, and declines in the value of investments; and  •significant interruptions to our systems and operations.  Catastrophic events are generally unpredictable. Our exposure to catastrophes depends on various factors, including the frequency and severity of the catastrophes, the rate of inflation and the value and geographic concentration of insured property and people. Vendor models and proprietary assumptions and processes that we use to manage catastrophe exposure may prove to be ineffective due to incorrect assumptions or estimates.  In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions following major catastrophes could require us to pay the insured beyond the provisions of the original insurance policy and may prohibit the application of a deductible, resulting in inflated catastrophe claims.  For further details on potential catastrophic events, including a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophes, see Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Insurance Operations Risks — AIG Property Casualty Key Insurance Risks.  Insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss expenses. We regularly review the adequacy of the established Liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expense and conduct extensive analyses of our reserves during the year. Our loss reserves, however, may develop adversely. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process, particularly for long-tail casualty lines of business. These include, but are not limited to, general liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental, workers' compensation, excess casualty and crisis management coverages, insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products, as well as excess and umbrella liability, D&O and products liability.  While we use a number of analytical reserve development techniques to project future loss development, reserves may be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be due to difficulties in predicting changes, such as changes in inflation, the judicial environment, or other social or economic factors affecting claims. Any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year or number of years. For a further discussion of our loss reserves, see Item 7. MD&A — Results of Operations — Segment Results — AIG Property Casualty Operations — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense and Critical   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  35      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  Accounting Estimates — Liability for Unpaid Claims and Claims Adjustment Expense (AIG Property Casualty and Mortgage Guaranty).  Reinsurance may not be available or affordable and may not be adequate to protect us against losses. Our subsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and we use reinsurance as part of our overall risk management strategy, and have continued our strategy, adopted in 2010, to improve the allocation of our reinsurance between traditional reinsurance markets and the capital markets, such as through the utilization of catastrophe bonds, to manage risks more efficiently. While reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their obligation to pay claims for losses insured under our policies, it does make the reinsurer liable to them for the reinsured portion of the risk. For this reason, reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention and to mitigate losses from catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of reinsurance. For example, reinsurance may be more difficult or costly to obtain after a year with a large number of major catastrophes. As a result, we may, at certain times, be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms. In that case, we would have to accept an increase in exposure risk, reduce the amount of business written by our subsidiaries or seek alternatives. Additionally, we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiaries' reinsurers to the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured by collateral or does not benefit from other credit enhancements. We also bear the risk that a reinsurer may be unwilling to pay amounts we have recorded as reinsurance recoverable for any reason, including that (i) the terms of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the parties of the contract, (ii) the terms of the contract cannot be legally enforced, (iii) the terms of the contract are interpreted by a court differently than intended, (iv) the reinsurance transaction performs differently than we anticipated due to a flawed design of the reinsurance structure, terms or conditions, or (v) a change in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of the laws and regulations, materially impacts a reinsurance transaction. The insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers, or inability or unwillingness to make timely payments under the terms of our agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, the use of catastrophe bonds may not provide the same levels of protection as traditional reinsurance transactions and any disruption, volatility and uncertainty in the catastrophe bond market, such as following a major catastrophe event, may limit our ability to access such market on terms favorable to us or at all. Also, some catastrophe bond transactions may be based on an industry loss index rather than on actual losses incurred by us, which would result in residual risk. Our inability to obtain adequate reinsurance or other protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We currently have limited reinsurance coverage for terrorist attacks. Further, the availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism is limited. As a result, we rely heavily on the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (TRIPRA), which provides U.S. government risk assistance to the insurance industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incidents in the United States. Under TRIPRA, once our losses for certain acts of terrorism exceed a deductible equal to 20 percent of our commercial property and casualty insurance premiums for the prior calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for 85 percent of losses in excess of our deductible, up to a total industry program limit of $100 billion. However, TRIPRA is scheduled to expire in December 2014, and there is no assurance that TRIPRA will be renewed in its current form or at all. To the extent that TRIPRA is renewed on less favorable terms or is not renewed at all, we may not hold adequate terrorism reinsurance coverage or reserves in the event of one or more insured terrorist incidents in the United States, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  For additional information on our reinsurance, see Item 7. MD&A — Enterprise Risk Management — Insurance Operations Risks — AIG Property Casualty Key Insurance Risks — Reinsurance Recoverable.      LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL AND CREDIT     Our internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt, maturing debt obligations and to meet any statutory capital requirements of our subsidiaries. If our liquidity is insufficient to meet our needs, we may at the time need to have recourse to third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, which may not be available or could be prohibitively expensive. The availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit, regulatory actions and our credit ratings and credit capacity. It is also possible that, as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long-or short-term financial   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  36      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  prospects. Disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets, and downgrades in our credit ratings, may limit our ability to access external capital markets at times and on terms favorable to us to meet our capital and liquidity needs or prevent our accessing the external capital markets or other financing sources. For a further discussion of our liquidity, see Item 7. MD&A — Liquidity and Capital Resources.  A downgrade in our credit ratings could require us to post additional collateral and result in the termination of derivative transactions. Credit ratings estimate a company's ability to meet its obligations and may directly affect the cost and availability of financing. A downgrade of our long-term debt ratings by the major rating agencies would require us to post additional collateral payments related to derivative transactions to which we are a party, and could permit the termination of these derivative transactions. This could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period or our liquidity. In the event of further downgrades of two notches to our long-term senior debt ratings, AIG would be required to post additional collateral of $111 million, and certain of our counterparties would be permitted to elect early termination of contracts.  AIG Parent's ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited. As a holding company, AIG Parent depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends on AIG Common Stock and to make payments due on its obligations, including its outstanding debt. The majority of our investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments or advance funds to AIG Parent in the future because of the need to support their own capital levels or because of regulatory limits. The inability of our subsidiaries to make payments, dividends or distributions in an amount sufficient to enable AIG Parent to meet its cash requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations, our ability to pay dividends or our ability to meet our debt service obligations.  AIG Parent's ability to support our subsidiaries is limited. AIG Parent has in the past and expects to continue to provide capital to our subsidiaries as necessary to maintain regulatory capital ratios, comply with rating agency requirements and meet unexpected cash flow obligations. If AIG Parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could be seized by its regulator.  Our subsidiaries may not be able to generate cash to meet their needs due to the illiquidity of some of their investments. Our subsidiaries have investments in certain securities that may be illiquid, including certain fixed income securities and certain structured securities, private company securities, private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans, finance receivables and real estate. Collectively, investments in these assets had a fair value of $49 billion at December 31, 2013. Adverse real estate and capital markets, and tighter credit spreads, have in the past, and may in the future, materially adversely affect the liquidity of our other securities portfolios, including our residential and commercial mortgage-related securities portfolios. In the event additional liquidity is required by one or more of our subsidiaries and AIG Parent is unable to provide it, it may be difficult for these subsidiaries to generate additional liquidity by selling, pledging or otherwise monetizing these less liquid investments.  A downgrade in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance companies could prevent them from writing new business and retaining customers and business. Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. IFS ratings measure an insurance company's ability to meet its obligations to contract holders and policyholders. High ratings help maintain public confidence in a company's products, facilitate marketing of products and enhance its competitive position. Downgrades of the IFS ratings of our insurance companies could prevent these companies from selling, or make it more difficult for them to succeed in selling, products and services, or result in increased policy cancellations, termination of assumed reinsurance contracts, or return of premiums. Under credit rating agency policies concerning the relationship between parent and subsidiary ratings, a downgrade in AIG Parent's credit ratings could result in a downgrade of the IFS ratings of our insurance subsidiaries.      BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS     Interest rate fluctuations, increased surrenders, declining investment returns and other events may require our subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of DAC and record additional liabilities for future policy benefits. We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. DAC represents deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. The recovery of DAC is generally dependent upon the future profitability of the related business, but DAC amortization varies based on the type of contract. For long-duration traditional business, DAC is   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  37      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  generally amortized in proportion to premium revenue and varies with lapse experience. Actual lapses in excess of expectations can result in an acceleration of DAC amortization.  DAC for investment-oriented products is generally amortized in proportion to estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are affected by a number of assumptions, including current and expected interest rates, net investment income and spreads, net realized gains and losses, fees, surrender rates, mortality experience and equity market returns and volatility. If actual and/or future estimated gross profits are less than originally expected, then the amortization of DAC would be accelerated in the period the actual experience is known and would result in a charge to income. For example, if interest rates rise rapidly and significantly, customers with policies that have interest crediting rates below the current market may seek competing products with higher returns and we may experience an increase in surrenders and withdrawals of life and annuity contracts, resulting in a decrease in future profitability and an acceleration of the amortization of DAC.  We also periodically review products for potential loss recognition events, principally insurance-oriented products. This review involves estimating the future profitability of in-force business and requires significant management judgment about assumptions including mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses, and investment returns, including net realized capital gains (losses). If actual experience or estimates result in projected future losses, we may be required to amortize any remaining DAC and record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefit expense, which could negatively affect our results of operations. For example, realized gains on investment sales in 2012 and 2013 have reduced future investment margins and required the recognition of additional liabilities for certain payout annuities. For further discussion of DAC and future policy benefits, see Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 9 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Certain of our products offer guarantees that may increase the volatility of our results. We offer variable annuity products that guarantee a certain level of benefits, such as guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB), guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) and guaranteed minimum account value benefits (GMAV). For GMDB, our most widely offered guaranteed benefit feature, the liabilities included in Future policyholder benefits at December 31, 2013 were $355 million. Our economic hedging program utilizes derivative instruments, including equity options, futures contracts and interest rate swap contracts, and is designed so that changes in value of the derivative instruments move in the opposite direction of changes in the GMWB and GMAV embedded derivative liabilities. Differences between the change in fair value of GMWB and GMAV embedded derivative liabilities and the hedging instruments can be caused by extreme and unanticipated movements in the equity markets, interest rates and market volatility, policyholder behavior and our inability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with the desired risk and return trade-off. While we believe that our actions have reduced the risks related to guaranteed benefits, our exposure is not fully hedged, and we remain liable if counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. In addition, we remain exposed to the risk that policyholder behavior and mortality may differ from our assumptions. Finally, downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility or reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the liabilities associated with the guaranteed benefits, reducing our net income and shareholders' equity. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates for more information regarding these products.  Indemnity claims could be made against us in connection with divested businesses. We have provided financial guarantees and indemnities in connection with the businesses we have sold, including ALICO, as described in greater detail in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While we do not currently believe the claims under these indemnities will be material, it is possible that significant indemnity claims could be made against us. If such a claim or claims were successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these financial guarantees and indemnities.  Our foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations. We provide insurance, investment and other financial products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries. A substantial portion of our AIG Property Casualty business is conducted outside the United States, and we intend to continue to grow this business. Operations outside the United States, particularly in developing nations, may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect our other operations.  The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. AIG subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that local licenses may require AIG Parent to   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  38      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  meet certain conditions. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Consequently, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in some of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country.  We may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels. Although we distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution channels, we maintain relationships with certain key distributors. Distributors have in the past, and may in the future, elect to renegotiate the terms of existing relationships, or reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, including for such reasons as industry consolidation of distributors or other industry changes that increase the competition for access to distributors, adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. An interruption in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, when our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution, despite our training and compliance programs. If our products are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or distributed in any other inappropriate manner, we may suffer reputational and other harm to our business.  Significant conditions precedent must be satisfied to complete the sale of the common stock of ILFC on the agreed terms. On December 16, 2013, AIG and AIG Capital Corporation (Seller), a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of AIG, entered into a definitive agreement (the AerCap Share Purchase Agreement) with AerCap Holdings N.V. (AerCap) and AerCap Ireland Limited (Purchaser), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AerCap, for the sale of 100% of the common stock of ILFC by Seller to Purchaser (such transaction, the AerCap Transaction). Under the terms of the AerCap Share Purchase Agreement, consummation of the AerCap Transaction is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions precedent, such as certain customary conditions and other closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals or non-disapprovals from antitrust and other regulatory bodies. The AerCap Transaction was approved by AerCap shareholders on February 13, 2014.  Any relevant regulatory body may refuse its approval or may seek to make its approval subject to compliance by ILFC or the Purchaser with unanticipated or onerous conditions. Even if approval is not required, the regulator may impose requirements on ILFC subsequent to consummation of the AerCap Transaction. We or the Purchaser might not agree to such conditions or requirements and may have a contractual right to terminate the AerCap Share Purchase Agreement.  In addition to other customary termination events, the Share Purchase Agreement allows termination by (i) AIG, Seller or Purchaser if the closing of the AerCap Transaction has not occurred on or before September 16, 2014 (the Long-Stop Date), subject to an extension to December 16, 2014 for the receipt of certain approvals, (ii) AIG, Seller or Purchaser in the event that approvals or non-disapprovals from certain regulatory bodies have not been obtained by the Long-Stop Date (as extended), (iii) AIG or Seller, if the AerCap board of directors withdraws or adversely modifies its approval of the AerCap Transaction or (iv) AIG or Seller if all conditions are satisfied, AIG and Seller are prepared to close but Purchaser fails to close the AerCap Transaction as required.  Because of the closing conditions and termination rights applicable to the AerCap Transaction, completion of the AerCap Transaction is not assured or may be delayed or, even if the transaction is completed, the terms of the sale may need to be significantly restructured.  The completion of the AerCap Transaction as contemplated could expose us to additional risks related to AerCap's stock and credit. Upon completion of the AerCap Transaction, we will hold approximately 46 percent of the common stock of AerCap. As a result, declines in the value of AerCap's common stock, and the other effects of our accounting for this investment under the equity method of accounting, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a reporting period.  In addition, in connection with the AerCap Transaction, AIG, AerCap, Purchaser, AerCap Ireland Capital Limited (AerCap Ireland) and certain subsidiaries of AerCap, as guarantors, entered into a credit agreement for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility between AerCap Ireland, as borrower, and AIG, as lender and administrative agent (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility provides for an aggregate commitment of $1 billion and   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  39      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  permits loans for general corporate purposes. An event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Failure to complete the AerCap Transaction could negatively affect our businesses and financial results. If the AerCap Transaction is not completed, the ongoing businesses of ILFC and AIG may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:  •alternative plans to dispose of ILFC, such as through a sale or initial public offering, may be difficult to structure and may take extended periods of time to implement, depending on, among other things, the global economic and regulatory environments and general market conditions;  •we may not be able to realize equivalent or greater value for ILFC under an alternative asset monetization plan which could impact the carrying values of ILFC's assets and liabilities;  •we will have incurred certain significant costs relating to the disposition of ILFC without receiving the benefits of the AerCap Transaction, and may incur further significant costs if an alternative monetization plan is undertaken;  •negative customer perception could adversely affect ILFC's ability to compete for, maintain or win new and existing business in the marketplace; and  •potential further diversion of our management's time and attention.  Significant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We are party to numerous legal proceedings, including securities class actions and regulatory and governmental investigations. Due to the nature of these proceedings, the lack of precise damage claims and the type of claims we are subject to, we cannot currently quantify our ultimate or maximum liability for these actions. Developments in these unresolved matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO) has brought suits against the United States (including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) challenging the government's assistance of AIG, pursuant to which (i) AIG entered into a credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; (ii) the United States received an approximately 80 percent ownership interest in AIG; and (iii) AIG entered into transactions involving Maiden Lane III LLC. The United States has alleged that AIG is obligated to indemnify the United States for any recoveries in these lawsuits. A determination that the United States is liable for damages in such suits, together with a determination that AIG is obligated to indemnify the United States, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of the SICO litigation and other unresolved matters, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  If we are unable to maintain the availability of our electronic data systems and safeguard the security of our data, our ability to conduct business may be compromised, which could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and utilize customer, employee, and company data and information. Some of these systems in turn, rely upon third-party systems. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems to perform necessary business functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing premium payments, making changes to existing policies, filing and paying claims, administering variable annuity products and mutual funds, providing customer support and managing our investment portfolios. Systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. In the event of a natural disaster, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or other disruption inside or outside the U.S., our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time, and our employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled or destroyed. Our systems have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to unauthorized access, such as physical or electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. AIG maintains cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised. In some cases, such unauthorized access may not be immediately detected. This may impede or interrupt our business operations and could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  40                Table of Contents    ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  In addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although we attempt to keep such information confidential, we may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect confidential information. Furthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the European Union or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could result in remediation costs, legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.      REGULATION     Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability. Our operations generally, and our insurance subsidiaries, in particular, are subject to extensive and potentially conflicting supervision and regulation by national authorities and by the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition. State and foreign regulators also periodically review and investigate our insurance businesses, including AIG-specific and industry-wide practices. The primary purpose of insurance regulation is the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our investors. The extent of domestic regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments.  We strive to maintain all required licenses and approvals. However, our businesses may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations. The relevant authority's interpretation of the laws and regulations also may change from time to time. Regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the required licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, these authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit them to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company.  In the U.S., the RBC formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Virtually every state has adopted, in substantial part, the RBC Model Law promulgated by the NAIC, which specifies the regulatory actions the insurance regulator may take if an insurer's RBC calculations fall below specific thresholds. Those actions range from requiring an insurer to submit a plan describing how it would regain a specified RBC ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. Regulators at the federal and international levels are also considering the imposition of additional capital requirements on certain insurance companies, which may include us, that may augment or even displace state-law RBC standards that apply at the legal entity level, and such capital calculations may be made on bases other than the statutory statements of our insurance subsidiaries. See "Our status as a savings and loan holding company and a systemically important financial institution, as well as the enactment of Dodd-Frank, will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and cash flows" and "Actions by foreign governments and regulators could subject us to substantial additional regulation" below for additional information on increased capital requirements that may be imposed on us. We cannot predict the effect these initiatives may have on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. AIG subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that local licenses may require AIG Parent to meet certain conditions. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country.  See Item 1. Business — Regulation for further discussion of our regulatory environment.  Our status as a savings and loan holding company and a systemically important financial institution, as well as the enactment of Dodd-Frank , will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation, which may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and cash flows. On July 21, 2010, Dodd-Frank, which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States, was   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  41      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  signed into law. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, an ongoing process anticipated to continue over the next few years.  We cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted, the level and magnitude of supervision we may become subject to, or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible that the regulations adopted under Dodd-Frank and our regulation by the FRB as an SLHC or as a SIFI could significantly alter our business practices, limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome and costly requirements and additional costs. Some of the regulations may also affect the perceptions of regulators, customers, counterparties, creditors or investors about our financial strength and could potentially affect our financing costs.  See Item 1. Business — Regulation for further discussion of the details of the aforementioned regulations to which AIG and its businesses are subject.  Actions by foreign governments and regulators could subject us to substantial additional regulation. We cannot predict the impact laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions may have on the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible such laws and regulations, and the impact of our designation as a global systemically important insurer (G-SII), may significantly alter our business practices, limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. It is possible that the laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions will differ from one another and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions including the United States.  In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, regulators and lawmakers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and taking steps to avoid similar problems in the future. The FSB, consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly global systemically important financial institutions, should be regulated. These frameworks and recommendations address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The FSB has directed the IAIS to create standards relative to these areas and incorporate them within that body's ICPs. Lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries conduct business have already begun implementing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with these recommendations.  The FSB has also charged the IAIS with developing a template for measuring systemic risks posed by insurer groups. The IAIS has requested data from selected insurers around the world to determine which elements of the insurance sector, if any, could materially and adversely impact other parts of the global financial services sector (e.g., commercial and investment banking, securities trading, etc.). The IAIS has provided its assessment template to the FSB. Based on this assessment template, on July 18, 2013, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national authorities, identified an initial list of global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs), which includes AIG. The IAIS intends G-SIIs to be subject to a policy framework that includes recovery and resolution planning requirements, enhanced group-wide supervision, basic capital requirements (BCR) and higher loss absorbency (HLA) capital requirements.  The IAIS is also developing a ComFrame, a Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs), which includes additional supervisory oversight based on its ICPs but also adds requirements and supervisory processes pertaining to the international business activities of IAIGs. As currently delineated under the ComFrame, we meet the parameters set forth to define an IAIG. While we currently do not know when any ComFrame requirements will be finalized and become effective, the IAIS will undertake a field testing of the ComFrame, including the possibility of additional capital requirements for IAIGs, which is expected to commence in the beginning of 2014. It is expected that implementation of the ComFrame would begin in 2019.  Solvency II Legislation in the European Union could also affect our international insurance operations by reforming minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards.  For further details on these international regulations and their potential impact on AIG and its businesses, see Item 1. Business — Regulation — Other Regulatory Developments.   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  42      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  The USA PATRIOT Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar laws that apply to us may expose us to significant penalties. The operations of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations, including, in some cases, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which require companies to know certain information about their clients and to monitor their transactions for suspicious activities. Also, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control administers regulations requiring U.S. persons to refrain from doing business, or allowing their clients to do business through them, with certain organizations or individuals on a prohibited list maintained by the U.S. government or with certain countries. The United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions maintain similar laws and regulations. Although we have instituted compliance programs to address these requirements, there are inherent risks in global transactions.  Attempts to efficiently manage the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline AXXX may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The NAIC Model Regulation "Valuation of Life Insurance Policies" (Regulation XXX) requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and universal life policies with secondary guarantees. In addition, NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (AXXX) (Guideline AXXX) clarifies the application of Regulation XXX as to certain universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees.  AIG Life and Retirement manages the capital impact on its life insurers of statutory reserve requirements under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX through affiliated reinsurance transactions, to maintain our ability to offer competitive pricing and successfully market such products. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on statutory reserving requirements under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX and our use of affiliated reinsurance. The NAIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services and other regulators have increased their focus on life insurers' affiliated reinsurance transactions used to satisfy certain reserve requirements or to manage the capital impact of certain statutory reserve requirements, particularly transactions using captive insurance companies or special purpose vehicles. While AIG Life and Retirement does not use captive or special purpose vehicle structures for this purpose, we cannot predict whether any applicable insurance laws will be changed in a way that prohibits or adversely impacts the use of affiliated reinsurance. If regulations change, we could be required to increase statutory reserves, increase prices on our products or incur higher expenses to obtain reinsurance, which could adversely affect our competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. If our actions to efficiently manage the impact of Regulation XXX or Guideline AXXX on future sales of term and universal life insurance products are not successful, we may reduce the sales of these products or incur higher operating costs, or it may impact our sales of these products.  New regulations promulgated from time to time may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively. Legislators and regulators may periodically consider various proposals that may affect the profitability of certain of our businesses. New regulations may even affect our ability to conduct certain businesses at all, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage and the size of financial institutions. These proposals could also impose additional taxes on a limited subset of financial institutions and insurance companies (either based on size, activities, geography, government support or other criteria). It is uncertain whether and how these and other such proposals would apply to us or our competitors or how they could impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively.  An "ownership change" could limit our ability to utilize tax losses and credits carryforwards to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2013, we had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $34.2 billion, $ 1.1 billion in capital loss carryforwards and $5.8 billion in foreign tax credits (tax losses and credits carryforwards). Our ability to use such tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an "ownership change" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of AIG Parent's ownership (by value) of one or more "5-percent shareholders" (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax losses and credits carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax losses and credits carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section 382 would depend on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change.   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  43      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  If we were to experience an "ownership change", it is possible that a significant portion of our tax losses and credits carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.  On March 9, 2011, our Board adopted our Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) to help protect these tax losses and credits carryforwards, and on January 8, 2014, the Board adopted an amendment to the Plan, extending its expiration date to January 8, 2017. The Board intends to submit the amendment of the Plan to our shareholders for ratification at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. At our 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholders adopted a protective amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Protective Amendment), which is designed to prevent certain transfers of AIG Common Stock that could result in an "ownership change" and currently expires on May 11, 2014. The Board intends to submit to our shareholders for approval at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders an amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation to adopt a successor to the Protective Amendment that contains substantially the same terms as the Protective Amendment but would expire on the third anniversary of the date of our 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an "ownership change" by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99 percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of AIG Common Stock. The Protective Amendment generally restricts any transfer of AIG Common Stock that would (i) increase the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of AIG stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the percentage of AIG stock owned by a Five Percent Stockholder (as defined in the Plan). Despite the intentions of the Plan and the Protective Amendment to deter and prevent an "ownership change", such an event may still occur. In addition, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may discourage open market purchases of AIG Common Stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for AIG Common Stock. Accordingly, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may limit a shareholder's ability to realize a premium over the market price of AIG Common Stock in connection with any stock transaction.  Changes in tax laws could increase our corporate taxes, reduce our deferred tax assets or make some of our products less attractive to consumers. Changes in tax laws or their interpretation could negatively impact our business or results. Some proposed changes could have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate by reducing deductions or increasing income inclusions, such as by limiting rules that allow for deferral of tax on certain foreign insurance income. Conversely, other changes, such as lowering the U.S. federal corporate tax rate discussed recently in the context of tax reform, could reduce the value of our deferred tax assets. In addition, changes in the way foreign taxes can be credited against U.S. taxes, methods for allocating interest expense, the ways insurance companies calculate and deduct reserves for tax purposes, and impositions of new or changed premium, value added and other indirect taxes could increase our tax expense, thereby reducing earnings.  In addition to proposing to change the taxation of corporations in general and insurance companies in particular, the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government and Congress have considered proposals that could increase taxes on owners of insurance products. For example, there are proposals that would limit the deferral of tax on income from life and annuity contracts relative to other investment products. These changes could reduce demand in the U.S. for life insurance and annuity contracts, or cause consumers to shift from these contracts to other investments, which would reduce our income due to lower sales of these products or potential increased surrenders of in-force business.  Governments' need for additional revenue makes it likely that there will be continued proposals to change tax rules in ways that would reduce our earnings. However, it remains difficult to predict whether or when there will be any tax law changes having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.      BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF ILFC PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE AERCAP TRANSACTION     We will be subject to the following risks until we complete the AerCap Transaction: Our aircraft leasing business depends on lease revenues and exposes us to the risk of lessee nonperformance. A decrease in ILFC's customers' ability to meet their obligations to ILFC under their leases may negatively affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.  Customer demand for certain aircraft may be lower than anticipated, which could negatively impact ILFC's business. Aircraft are long-lived assets and demand for a particular model and type can decline over time. Demand may fall for a variety of reasons, including obsolescence following the introduction of newer technologies, market saturation due to increased production rates, technical problems associated with a particular model, new   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  44      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  manufacturers entering the marketplace, additional governmental regulation, or the overall health of the airline industry. This may result in declining lease rates, losses on sales, impairment charges or fair value adjustments and may adversely affect ILFC's business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.      COMPETITION AND EMPLOYEES     We face intense competition in each of our businesses. Our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Our principal competitors are other large multinational insurance organizations, as well as banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions. The insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the U.S., AIG Property Casualty subsidiaries compete with approximately 4,000 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual insurance companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG Life and Retirement subsidiaries compete in the U.S. with approximately 2,300 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, our subsidiaries compete for business with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies.  The past reduction of our credit ratings and past negative publicity have made, and may continue to make, it more difficult to compete to retain existing customers and to maintain our historical levels of business with existing customers and counterparties. General insurance and life insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, and terms and conditions. Retirement services companies compete through crediting rates and the issuance of guaranteed benefits. A decline in our position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability.  Competition for employees in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Due to the intense competition in our industry for key employees with demonstrated ability, we may be unable to hire or retain such employees. Losing any of our key people also could have a material adverse effect on our operations given their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key employees.  Mr. Benmosche may be unable to continue to provide services to AIG due to his health. Robert Benmosche, our President and Chief Executive Officer, was diagnosed with cancer and has been undergoing treatment for his disease. He continues to fulfill all of his responsibilities and has stated his desire to continue in such roles until the first quarter of 2015. However, his condition may change and prevent him from continuing to perform these roles.  Managing key employee succession and retention is critical to our success. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. While we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.  Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses. There have been a number of cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and we run the risk that employee misconduct could occur. Instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, misuse of customer or proprietary information, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the controls that we have in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.      ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS     Actual experience may differ from management's estimates used in the preparation of financial statements. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), which requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. The accounting policies that we consider most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore may be viewed as critical accounting estimates, are described in Item 7. MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. These estimates are based on judgment, current facts and circumstances, and, when applicable,   AIG 2013 Form 10-K  45      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A / RISK FACTORS  internally developed models. Therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates, possibly in the near term, and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  Changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could impact our reported results of operations and our reported financial position. Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet required to be implemented is disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The FASB and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) have ongoing projects to revise accounting standards for insurance contracts. While the final resolution of changes to U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards pursuant to these projects is unclear, changes to the manner in which we account for insurance products could have a significant impact on our future financial reports, operations, capital management and business. Further, the adoption of a new insurance contracts standard as well as other future accounting standards could have a material effect on our reported results of operations and reported financial condition.  Changes in our assumptions regarding the discount rate, expected rate of return, and expected compensation for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability. We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets, expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these assumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment, may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.
