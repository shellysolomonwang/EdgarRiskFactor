Item 1A. Risk Factors — Reinsurance, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Reinsurance and Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Insurance Investment Operations   A significant portion of AIG’s General Insurance and Life Insurance & Retirement Services revenues are derived from AIG’s    10 AIG 2006 Form 10-K       American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             insurance investment operations, which are summarized in the following table.    The following table summarizes the investment results of the insurance operations.                                                         Annual Average Cash and Invested Assets                       Cash               (including       Return on   Return on   Years Ended December 31,   short-term   Invested       Average Cash   Average   (in millions)   investments)   Assets(a)(b)   Total   and Assets(c)   Assets(d)         General Insurance:                                              2006    $ 3,201     $ 102,231     $ 105,432       5.4 %     5.6 %     2005      2,450       86,211       88,661       4.5       4.7       2004      2,012       73,338       75,350       4.2       4.4       2003      1,818       59,855       61,673       4.2       4.3       2002      1,537       47,477       49,014       4.8       5.0       Life Insurance & Retirement Services:                                              2006    $ 7,205     $ 384,724     $ 391,929       5.0 %     5.1 %     2005      6,180       352,250       358,430       5.1       5.1       2004      5,089       307,659       312,748       4.9       5.0       2003      4,680       247,608       252,288       5.1       5.2       2002      3,919       199,750       203,669       5.5       5.6                 (a)   Including investment income due and accrued and real estate.       (b)   Includes collateral assets invested under the securities lending program.       (c)   Net investment income divided by the annual average sum of cash and invested assets.       (d)   Net investment income divided by the annual average invested assets.    AIG’s worldwide insurance investment policy places primary emphasis on investments in government and other high quality, fixed income securities in all of its portfolios and, to a lesser extent, investments in high yield bonds, common stocks, real estate, hedge funds and partnerships, in order to enhance returns on policyholders’ funds and generate net investment income. The ability to implement this policy is somewhat limited in certain territories as there may be a lack of adequate long-term investments or investment restrictions may be imposed by the local regulatory authorities.   Financial Services Operations   AIG’s Financial Services subsidiaries engage in diversified activities including aircraft and equipment leasing, capital markets, consumer finance and insurance premium finance. Together, the Aircraft Leasing, Capital Markets and Consumer Finance operations generate the majority of the revenues produced by the Financial Services operations. Imperial A.I. Credit Companies also contribute to Financial Services income. This operation engages principally in insurance premium financing for both AIG’s customers and those of other insurers.   Aircraft Leasing    AIG’s Aircraft Leasing operations represent the operations of ILFC, which generates its revenues primarily from leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to foreign and domestic airlines. Revenues also result from the remarketing of commercial jets for its own account, and remarketing and fleet management services for airlines and for financial institutions. See also Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Capital Markets    The Capital Markets operations of AIG are conducted primarily through AIGFP, which engages as principal in standard and customized interest rate, currency, equity, commodity, energy and credit products with top-tier corporations, financial institutions, governments, agencies, institutional investors, and high-net-worth individuals throughout the world. AIGFP also invests in a diversified portfolio of securities and principal investments and engages in borrowing activities that include issuing standard and structured notes and other securities and entering into guaranteed investment agreements (GIAs). See also Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Consumer Finance    Consumer Finance operations include AGF as well as AIGCFG. AGF provides a wide variety of consumer finance products, including real estate and non-real estate loans, retail sales finance and credit-related insurance to customers in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. AIGCFG, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in developing a multi-product consumer finance business with an emphasis on emerging markets.   Asset Management Operations   AIG’s Asset Management operations comprise a wide variety of investment-related services and investment products, including institutional and retail asset management, broker-dealer services and institutional spread-based investment business. Such services and products are offered to individuals and institutions both domestically and overseas. Asset Management’s spread-based    Form 10-K 2006 AIG 11       American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             investment business includes the results of AIG’s proprietary institutional spread-based investment operation, the Matched Investment Program (MIP), which was launched in September of 2005 and replaced the GIC program.   AIG’s principal Asset Management operations are conducted through certain subsidiaries of AIG Retirement Services, Inc., including SAAMCo and the AIG Advisor Group broker dealers (AIG SunAmerica); and through AIGGIG, including AIG Global Investment Corp., AIG Global Real Estate and AIG Private Bank. AIG SunAmerica sells and manages mutual funds and provides financial advisory services through independent-contractor registered representatives. AIGGIG manages invested assets on a global basis for AIG subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as third-party institutional, retail, and private banking clients. AIGGIG offers equity, fixed income and alternative investment funds and provides securities lending and custodial services and numerous forms of structured investment products across all asset classes. Each of these subsidiary operations receives fees for investment products and services provided.   Other Operations   Certain other AIG subsidiaries provide insurance-related services such as adjusting claims and marketing specialized products. Several wholly owned foreign subsidiaries of AIG operating in countries or jurisdictions such as Ireland, Bermuda, Barbados and Gibraltar provide insurance and related administrative and back office services to a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance and reinsurance companies, including captive insurance companies unaffiliated with AIG.   AIG also has several other subsidiaries which engage in various businesses. Mt. Mansfield Company, Inc. owns and operates the ski slopes, lifts, school and an inn located at Stowe, Vermont. Also included in AIG’s Other operations are unallocated corporate expenses, including interest expense and the settlement costs more fully described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 12(a) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Additional Investments   AIG’s significant investments in partially owned companies (which are accounted for under the equity method) include a 19.4 percent interest in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd. (AWAC), a property-casualty insurance holding company, a 24.5 percent interest in The Fuji Fire and Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., a general insurance company, a 26 percent interest in Tata AIG Life Insurance Company, Ltd. and a 26 percent interest in Tata AIG General Insurance Company, Ltd. For a discussion of AIG’s investments in partially owned companies, see Note 1(u) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Locations of Certain Assets   As of December 31, 2006, approximately 37 percent of the consolidated assets of AIG were located in foreign countries (other than Canada), including $6.5 billion of cash and securities on deposit with foreign regulatory authorities. Foreign operations and assets held abroad may be adversely affected by political developments in foreign countries, including such possibilities as tax changes, nationalization, and changes in regulatory policy, as well as by consequence of hostilities and unrest. The risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon AIG vary from country to country and cannot easily be predicted. If expropriation or nationalization does occur, AIG’s policy is to take all appropriate measures to seek recovery of such assets. Certain of the countries in which AIG’s business is conducted have currency restrictions which generally cause a delay in a company’s ability to repatriate assets and profits. See also Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors — Foreign Operations.   Regulation   AIG’s operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. The regulatory environment can have a significant effect on AIG and its business. AIG’s operations have become more diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In addition, the investigations into financial accounting practices that led to two restatements of AIG’s consolidated financial statements have heightened regulatory scrutiny of AIG worldwide.   In 1999, AIG became a unitary thrift holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act (HOLA) when the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) granted AIG approval to organize AIG Federal Savings Bank. AIG is subject to OTS regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the OTS has enforcement authority over AIG and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this permits the OTS to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of AIG’s subsidiary savings association, AIG Federal Savings Bank.   Under prior law, a unitary savings and loan holding company, such as AIG, was not restricted as to the types of business in which it could engage, provided that its savings association subsidiary continued to be a qualified thrift lender. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA) provides that no company may acquire control of an OTS regulated institution after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies under the law or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. The GLBA, however, grandfathered the unrestricted authority for activities with respect to a unitary savings and loan holding company existing prior to May 4, 1999, so long as its savings association subsidiary continues to be a qualified thrift lender under the HOLA. As a unitary savings and loan holding company whose application was pending as of May 4, 1999, AIG is grandfathered under the GLBA and generally is not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that AIG Federal Savings Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender under the HOLA.   Certain states require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in such states and are controlled by other corporations. Applicable legislation typically    12 AIG 2006 Form 10-K       American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             requires periodic disclosure concerning the corporation that controls the registered insurer and the other companies in the holding company system and prior approval of intercorporate services and transfers of assets (including in some instances payment of dividends by the insurance subsidiary) within the holding company system. AIG’s subsidiaries are registered under such legislation in those states that have such requirements.   AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, in common with other insurers, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and by other jurisdictions in which they do business. Within the United States, the method of such regulation varies but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to an insurance official. The regulation and supervision relate primarily to approval of policy forms and rates, the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, including risk-based capital measurements, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the equity owners of these companies.   In preparing both its 2004 and 2005 audited statutory financial statements for its Domestic General Insurance companies, AIG agreed with the relevant regulatory agencies on the statutory accounting treatment of the various items requiring adjustment or restatement. These adjustments and restatements reduced previously reported General Insurance statutory surplus at December 31, 2004 by approximately $3.5 billion to approximately $20.6 billion.   With respect to the 2005 audited statutory financial statements, the state regulators permitted the Domestic General Insurance companies to record a $724 million reduction to opening statutory surplus as of January 1, 2005.   AIG has taken various steps to enhance the capital positions of the Domestic General Insurance companies. AIG entered into capital maintenance agreements with the Domestic General Insurance companies that set forth procedures through which AIG will provide ongoing capital support. Dividends from the Domestic General Insurance companies were suspended from fourth quarter 2005 through 2006, but AIG expects that dividend payments will resume in the first quarter of 2007. AIG contributed an additional $750 million of capital into American Home effective September 30, 2005, and contributed a further $2.25 billion of capital in February 2006 for a total of approximately $3 billion of capital into Domestic General Insurance subsidiaries effective December 31, 2005. Furthermore, in order to allow the Domestic General Insurance companies to record as an admitted asset at December 31, 2006 certain reinsurance ceded to non-U.S. reinsurers (which has the effect of increasing the statutory surplus of such Domestic General Insurance companies), AIG obtained and entered into reimbursement agreements for approximately $2 billion of letters of credit issued by several commercial banks in favor of certain Domestic General Insurance companies.   Risk-Based Capital (RBC) is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Thus, inadequately capitalized general and life insurance companies may be identified.   The RBC formula develops a risk-adjusted target level of statutory surplus by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. Higher factors are applied to more risky items and lower factors are applied to less risky items. Thus, the target level of statutory surplus varies not only as a result of the insurer’s size, but also based on the risk profile of the insurer’s operations.   The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to placing the insurer under regulatory control.   The statutory surplus of each of AIG’s Domestic General and Life Insurance subsidiaries exceeded their RBC target levels as of December 31, 2006.   To the extent that any of AIG’s insurance entities would fall below prescribed levels of statutory surplus, it would be AIG’s intention to infuse necessary capital to support that entity.   A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance business is carried on in foreign countries. The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification or revocation by such authorities, and AIU or other AIG subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. In the past, AIU has been allowed to modify its operations to conform with new licensing requirements in most jurisdictions.   In addition to licensing requirements, AIG’s foreign operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to currency, policy language and terms, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investment and the share of profits to be returned to policyholders on participating policies. Some foreign countries regulate rates on various types of policies. Certain countries have established reinsurance institutions, wholly or partially owned by the local government, to which admitted insurers are obligated to cede a portion of their business on terms that may not always allow foreign insurers, including AIG subsidiaries, full compensation. In some countries, regulations governing constitution of technical reserves and remittance balances may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.

Form 10-K 2006 AIG 13       American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             Competition   AIG’s Insurance, Financial Services and Asset Management businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Principal sources of competition are insurance companies, banks, investment banks and other non-bank financial institutions.   The insurance industry in particular is highly competitive. Within the United States, AIG’s General Insurance subsidiaries compete with approximately 3,100 other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual companies and other underwriting organizations. AIG’s subsidiaries offering Life Insurance & Retirement Services compete in the United States with approximately 2,000 life insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, AIG subsidiaries compete for business with foreign insurance operations of the larger U.S. insurers, global insurance groups, and local companies in particular areas in which they are active.   AIG’s strong ratings have historically provided a competitive advantage. For a discussion of the possible adverse effects on AIG’s competitive position as a result of a ratings downgrade, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — AIG’s Credit Ratings.   Directors and Executive Officers of AIG   Set forth below is information concerning the directors and executive officers of AIG. All directors are elected for one-year terms at the annual meeting of shareholders. All executive officers are elected to one-year terms, but serve at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.   Except as hereinafter noted, each of the executive officers has, for more than five years, occupied an executive position with AIG or companies that are now its subsidiaries. Other than the employment contracts between AIG and Messrs. Sullivan and Bensinger, there are no other arrangements or understandings between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the executive officer was elected to such position. From January 2000 until joining AIG in May 2004, Dr. Frenkel served as Chairman of Merrill Lynch International, Inc. Prior to joining AIG in September 2002, Mr. Bensinger was Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Combined Specialty Group, Inc. (a division of Aon Corporation) commencing in March 2002, and served as Executive Vice President of Trenwick Group, Ltd. from October 1999 through December 2001. Prior to joining AIG in September 2006, Ms. Kelly served as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of MCI/WorldCom. Previously, she was Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Sears, Roebuck and Co. from 1999 to 2003.

Risk Factors   Casualty Insurance Underwriting and Reserves    Casualty insurance liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves for losses and loss expenses. Although AIG annually reviews the adequacy of the established reserve for losses and loss expenses, there can be no assurance that AIG’s ultimate loss reserves will not develop adversely and materially exceed AIG’s current loss reserves. Estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and loss reserves is a complex process for long-tail casualty lines of business, which include excess and umbrella liability, D&O, professional liability, medical malpractice, workers compensation, general liability, products liability and related classes, as well as for asbestos and environmental exposures. Generally, actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development. However, there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past. Moreover, any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be discernible for an extended period of time subsequent to the recording of the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year. Thus, there is the potential for reserves with respect to a number of years to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the reserves. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be attributable to changes in inflation or in the judicial environment, or in other social or economic phenomena affecting claims. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Operating Review — General Insurance Operations — Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses.   Adjustments to Life Insurance & Retirement Services Deferred Policy  Acquisition Costs    Interest rate fluctuations and other events may require AIG subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) which could adversely affect AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. DAC represents the costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts. When interest rates rise, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns, requiring AIG subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of DAC. To the extent such amortization exceeds surrender or other charges earned upon surrender and withdrawals of certain life insurance policies and annuity contracts, AIG’s results of operations could be negatively affected.   DAC for both insurance-oriented and investment-oriented products as well as retirement services products is reviewed for recoverability, which involves estimating the future profitability of current business. This review involves significant management judgment. If the actual emergence of future profitability were to be substantially lower than estimated, AIG could be required to accelerate its DAC amortization and such acceleration could adversely affect AIG’s results of operations. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 1 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Reinsurance    Reinsurance may not be available or affordable. AIG subsidiaries are major purchasers of reinsurance and utilize reinsurance as part of AIG’s overall risk management strategy. Reinsurance is an important risk management tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention, and to mitigate losses that may arise from catastrophes. Market conditions beyond AIG’s control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance purchased by AIG subsidiaries. For example, reinsurance may be more difficult to obtain after a year with a large number of major catastrophes. Accordingly, AIG may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, in which case AIG would have to accept an increase in exposure risk, reduce the amount of business written by its subsidiaries or seek alternatives.   Reinsurance subjects AIG to the credit risk of its reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect AIG against losses. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to the AIG subsidiary to the extent the risk is ceded, it does not relieve the AIG subsidiary of the primary liability to its policyholders. Accordingly, AIG bears credit risk with respect to its subsidiaries’ reinsurers. A reinsurer’s insolvency or inability or refusal to make timely payments under the terms of its agreements with the AIG subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on AIG’s results of operations and liquidity. See also Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Reinsurance.   A Material Weakness    The remaining material weakness in AIG’s internal control over financial reporting relating to income tax accounting could affect the accuracy or timing of future regulatory filings. As of December 31, 2006, AIG’s management concluded that the material weakness relating to the controls over income tax accounting was not fully remediated. Remediation of this material weakness is ongoing. Until remediated, this weakness could affect the accuracy or timing of future filings with the SEC and other regulatory authorities. See also Item 9A. Controls and Procedures — Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.   Catastrophe Exposures    The occurrence of catastrophic events could adversely affect AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, pandemic disease, acts of terrorism and other catastrophes could adversely affect AIG’s consolidated financial condition or results of    Form 10-K 2006 AIG 15       American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             operations, including by exposing AIG’s businesses to the following:           •   widespread claim costs associated with property, workers compensation, mortality and morbidity claims;     •   loss resulting from the cash flows from invested assets being less than the cash flows required to meet the policy and contract liabilities; or     •   loss resulting from the actual policy experience adversely emerging in comparison to the assumptions made in the product pricing associated with mortality, morbidity, termination and expenses.    Legal Proceedings    Significant legal proceedings adversely affected AIG’s results of operations in 2005. As a result of the settlements discussed below under Item 3. Legal Proceedings, AIG recorded an after-tax charge of approximately $1.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. AIG is party to numerous other legal proceedings and regulatory investigations. It is possible that the effect of the unresolved matters could be material to AIG’s consolidated results of operations for an individual reporting period. For a discussion of these unresolved matters, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.   Regulation    AIG is subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which it conducts its businesses. AIG’s operations around the world are subject to regulation by different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities, investment advisory, banking and thrift regulators in the United States and abroad. AIG’s operations have become more diverse and consumer-oriented, increasing the scope of regulatory supervision and the possibility of intervention. In particular, AIG’s consumer lending business is subject to a broad array of laws and regulations governing lending practices and permissible loan terms, and AIG would expect increased regulatory oversight relating to this business.   The regulatory environment could have a significant effect on AIG and its businesses. Among other things, AIG could be fined, prohibited from engaging in some of its business activities or subject to limitations or conditions on its business activities. Significant regulatory action against AIG could have material adverse financial effects, cause significant reputational harm, or harm business prospects. New laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to clients may also adversely affect AIG and its businesses.   Foreign Operations    Foreign operations expose AIG to risks that may affect its operations, liquidity and financial condition. AIG provides insurance and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions. A substantial portion of AIG’s General Insurance business and a majority of its Life Insurance & Retirement Services businesses are conducted outside the United States. Operations outside of the United States may be affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political upheaval, nationalization and other restrictive government actions, which could also affect other AIG operations.   The degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. Generally, AIG, as well as the underwriting companies operating in such jurisdictions, must satisfy local regulatory requirements. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to AIG subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Thus, AIG’s insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in certain of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. AIG’s international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments including tax changes, regulatory restrictions and nationalization of AIG’s operations without compensation. Adverse actions from any one country may adversely affect AIG’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and AIG’s net financial exposure at that time in that country.   Information Technology    A failure in AIG’s operational systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt business, damage AIG’s reputation and cause losses. AIG’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. AIG’s business depends on effective information systems and the integrity and timeliness of the data it uses to run its business. AIG’s ability to adequately price its products and services, establish reserves, provide effective and efficient service to its customers, and to timely and accurately report its financial results also depends significantly on the integrity of the data in its information systems. Although AIG takes protective measures and endeavors to modify them as circumstances warrant, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have security consequences. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize AIG’s or its clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, its computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in AIG’s, its clients’, its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage. AIG may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and AIG may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered by insurance maintained.   Despite the contingency plans and facilities AIG has in place, its ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption of the infrastructure that supports AIG’s business in the communities in which it is located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by AIG. These disruptions may occur, for example, as a result of events that affect only the buildings occupied by AIG or as a result of events    16 AIG 2006 Form 10-K       American International Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries             with a broader effect on the cities where those buildings are located. If a disruption occurs in one location and AIG’s employees in that location are unable to occupy its offices and conduct business or communicate with or travel to other locations, AIG’s ability to service and interact with its clients may suffer and it may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.   AIG’s Credit Ratings    Financial strength and credit ratings by major ratings agencies are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and other financial institutions and affect the availability and cost of borrowings. Any ratings downgrade may lessen AIG’s ability to compete in certain businesses and may increase AIG’s interest expense. Financial strength ratings measure an insurance company’s ability to meet its obligations to contract holders and policyholders, help to maintain public confidence in a company’s products, facilitate marketing of products and enhance a company’s competitive position. Credit ratings measure a company’s ability to repay its obligations and directly affect the cost and availability to that company of unsecured financing. Historically, AIG’s credit and financial strength ratings have provided AIG a competitive advantage.   From March through June of 2005, the major rating agencies downgraded the ratings of AIG and its insurance subsidiaries in a series of actions. Many of the ratings were put on negative watch or negative outlook, which indicates a potential downgrade. Since then, however, the agencies have affirmed the ratings of AIG and all of its subsidiaries with a stable outlook, which indicates that the rating is not likely to change in the near term, except that S&P maintains a negative outlook on Transatlantic and on the senior long-term debt rating of ILFC.   A downgrade of the credit or financial strength ratings of AIG or its subsidiaries could adversely affect AIG’s business and its consolidated results of operations in a number of ways, including:           •   increasing AIG’s interest expense;     •   reducing AIGFP’s ability to compete in the structured products and derivatives businesses;     •   reducing the competitive advantage of AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, which may result in reduced product sales and/or lower prices;     •   adversely affecting relationships with agents and sales representatives; and     •   in the case of a downgrade of AGF or ILFC, increasing their interest expense and reducing their ability to compete in their respective businesses.    As a result of the downgrades in 2005 discussed above, AIG was required to post approximately $1.16 billion of collateral with counterparties to municipal guaranteed investment contracts and financial derivatives transactions. In the event of a further downgrade, AIG would be required to post additional collateral. It is estimated that, as of the close of business on February 15, 2007, based on AIG’s outstanding municipal GIAs and financial derivatives transactions as of such date, a further downgrade of AIG’s long-term senior debt ratings to Aa3 by Moody’s or AA- by S&P would permit counterparties to call for approximately $864 million of additional collateral. Further, additional downgrades could result in requirements for substantial additional collateral, which could have a material effect on how AIG manages its liquidity. For a further discussion of AIG’s credit ratings and the potential effect of posting collateral on AIG’s liquidity, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Capital Resources and Liquidity — Credit Ratings and — Liquidity.   Liquidity    Liquidity risk represents the potential inability of AIG to meet all payment obligations when they become due. AIG’s liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen significant outflows of cash. This situation may arise due to circumstances that AIG may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or AIG. AIG depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund payments on AIG’s obligations, including debt obligations. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit AIG’s ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from its subsidiaries. In particular, many of AIG’s subsidiaries, including AIG’s insurance subsidiaries, are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to the parent holding company, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder AIG’s ability to access funds that AIG may need to make payments on its obligations. See also Item 1. Business — Regulation.   Some of AIG’s investments are relatively illiquid. AIG’s investments in certain fixed income investments, certain structured securities, direct private equities, limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate are relatively illiquid. These asset classes represented nine percent of the carrying value of AIG’s total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2006. If AIG requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements, AIG may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them for less than what AIG might otherwise have been able to, or both.   Concentration of AIG’s investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects. The concentration of AIG’s investment portfolios in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on the investment portfolios and consequently on AIG’s results of operations and financial position. While AIG seeks to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified. Further, AIG’s ability to sell assets relating to such particular industry, group of related industries or geographic region may be limited if other market participants are seeking to sell at the same time.

The Relationships Between AIG and  the Starr Entities    The relationships between AIG and the Starr entities may take an extended period of time to unwind and/or resolve, and the consequences of such resolution are uncertain. During 2006, AIG unwound and resolved its most significant relationships with C.V. Starr & Co, Inc. (Starr) and began unwinding and resolving various relationships with Starr International Company, Inc. (SICO). AIG cannot predict what its future relationship with Starr and SICO will be.   The agency relationships between AIG subsidiaries and Starr have been terminated and litigation with Starr has been resolved, but there can be no assurance that AIG will compete successfully for the business previously produced by the Starr agencies. In January 2006, Starr announced that it had completed its tender offers to purchase interests in Starr and that all eligible shareholders had tendered their shares. As a result of completion of the tender offers, no AIG executive currently holds any Starr interest.   AIG has entered into agreements pursuant to which AIG agrees, subject to certain conditions, to assure AIG’s current employees that all payments are made under a series of two-year Deferred Compensation Profit Participation Plans provided by SICO (SICO Plans). For a further discussion of the SICO plans, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that AIG will be able to effectively address the consequences for its executives of the unwinding of their participation in the SICO plans and programs. Finally, litigation between AIG and SICO remains pending, and the timing, terms and effect on AIG of any resolution cannot currently be predicted. See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings.   Employee Error and Misconduct    Employee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses. Losses may result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.   There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and AIG runs the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions AIG takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.   Aircraft Suppliers    There are limited suppliers of aircraft and engines. The supply of jet transport aircraft, which ILFC purchases and leases, is dominated by two airframe manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus, and a limited number of engine manufacturers. As a result, ILFC is dependent on the manufacturers’ success in remaining financially stable, producing aircraft and related components which meet the airlines’ demands, both in type and quantity, and fulfilling their contractual obligations to ILFC. Competition between the manufacturers for market share is intense and may lead to instances of deep discounting for certain aircraft types and may negatively affect ILFC’s competitive pricing.
