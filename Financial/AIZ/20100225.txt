Item 1A. Risk Factors.    Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.    Risks Related to Our Company    General economic, financial market and political conditions may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. Particularly, difficult conditions in financial markets and the global economy may negatively affect the results of all of our business segments.    General economic, financial market and political conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Concerns over the availability and cost of credit, the declining global mortgage and real estate market, the loss of consumer confidence, reduction in consumer spending, inflation, unemployment, energy costs and geopolitical issues, have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These conditions could affect all of our business segments. Specifically, during periods of economic downturn:        •    individuals and businesses (i) may choose not to purchase our insurance products, warranties and other related products and services, (ii) may terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse, (iii) may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased, and (iv) in the case of business customers of Assurant Health or Assurant Employee Benefits, may have fewer employees requiring insurance coverage due to reductions in their staffing levels;        •    clients are more likely to experience financial distress or declare bankruptcy or liquidation which could have an adverse impact on the remittance of premiums from such clients as well as the collection of receivables from such clients for items such as unearned premiums;        •    disability insurance claims and claims on other specialized insurance products tend to rise;        •    there is a higher loss ratio on credit card and installment loan insurance due to rising unemployment and disability levels;        •    there is a risk of potential increases in fraudulent insurance claims;        •    insureds tend to increase their utilization of health and dental benefits if they anticipate becoming unemployed or losing benefits; and        •    substantial decreases in loan availability and origination could have a long-term effect on premium writings.    In addition, general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and dental care, as well as repair and replacement costs on our real and personal property lines, increasing the costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures may also affect the costs associated with our preneed insurance policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to grow with the Consumer Price Index (or “CPI”). Conversely, deflationary pressures may affect the pricing of our products.    We are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities and non-governmental self-regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, foreign regulators, state insurance regulators, the SEC, the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. In light of current economic conditions, some of these authorities are considering or may in the future consider enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future financial crises or to otherwise assure the stability of institutions under their supervision. These authorities may also seek to exercise their supervisory or enforcement authority in new or more robust ways. All of these possibilities, if they occurred, could affect the way we conduct our business and manage our capital, either of which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.    12    Table of Contents Our income and profitability may decline if we are unable to maintain our relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties important to the success of our business.    Our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients, distributors, original equipment manufacturers and other parties with whom we do business are important to the success of our segments. Many of these arrangements are exclusive. For example, in Assurant Solutions, we have exclusive relationships with retailers and financial and other institutions through which we distribute our products, including an exclusive distribution relationship with SCI relating to the distribution of our preneed insurance policies. In Assurant Specialty Property, we have exclusive relationships with mortgage lenders and manufactured housing lenders and manufacturers. In Assurant Health, we have exclusive distribution relationships for our individual health insurance products with a major mutual insurance company as well as a relationship with a well-known association through which we provide many of our individual health insurance products. We also maintain contractual relationships with several separate networks of health and dental care providers, each referred to as a PPO, through which we obtain discounts. Typically, these relationships and contractual arrangements have terms ranging from one to five years.    Although we believe we have generally been successful in maintaining our client, distribution and associated relationships, if these parties decline to renew or seek to terminate these arrangements or seek to renew these contracts on terms less favorable to us, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. For example, a loss of one or more of the discount arrangements with PPOs could lead to higher medical or dental costs and/or a loss of members to other medical or dental plans. In addition, we are subject to the risk that these parties may face financial difficulties, reputational issues or problems with respect to their own products and services, which may lead to decreased sales of our products and services. Moreover, if one or more of our clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with other companies, we may lose business or suffer decreased revenues.    Sales of our products and services may be reduced if we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives or develop and maintain distribution sources.    We distribute our insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels, including independent employee benefits specialists, brokers, managing general agents, life agents, financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, retailers, funeral homes, association groups and other third-party marketing organizations.    Our relationships with these various distributors are significant both for our revenues and profits. We generally do not distribute our insurance products and services through captive or affiliated agents. In Assurant Health, we depend in large part on the services of independent agents and brokers and on associations in the marketing of our products. In Assurant Employee Benefits, independent agents and brokers who act as advisors to our customers market and distribute our products. Strong competition exists among insurers to form relationships with agents and brokers of demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers for relationships with agents, brokers, and other intermediaries primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services, product features, and more generally through our ability to meet the needs of their clients, our customers. Independent agents and brokers are typically not exclusively dedicated to us, but instead usually also market the products of our competitors and therefore we face continued competition from our competitors’ products. Moreover, our ability to market our products and services depends on our ability to tailor our channels of distribution to comply with changes in the regulatory environment in which we and such agents and brokers operate.    We have our own sales representatives whose distribution process varies by segment. We depend in large part on our sales representatives to develop and maintain client relationships. Our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    13    Table of Contents Our earnings could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill.    Goodwill represented $926,398 and $1,001,899 of our $25,841,796 and $24,514,586 in total assets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We review our goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include: a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in the business climate; and/or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Based on our 2009 annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that our Assurant Employee Benefits reporting unit experienced an impairment of $83,000. Based on the same test, it was determined that the goodwill assigned to our other three reporting units were not impaired. Should weak market conditions continue for an extend period or should the operating results of any of our reporting units decline substantially compared to the projected results or if other indicators of impairment exist, such as a continued significant decline in our share price and market capitalization, additional goodwill impairments, resulting in a non-cash charge to earnings, could occur.    Reform of the health care system is currently the subject of considerable debate in the U.S. Certain changes that have been proposed by various parties could have a material adverse effect on our health business. Should any of these proposals be enacted into law, they could result in a reduction of the value of our Assurant Health business unit and a corresponding goodwill impairment.    Current conditions in the capital and credit markets may significantly and adversely affect our access to capital and our ability to meet liquidity needs.    The global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption during 2008 and through early 2009. In some cases, the markets exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for almost all issuers. Conditions in the capital and credit markets improved throughout 2009, but continue to be volatile.    Liquidity and credit capacity are important to our business because they allow us to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our common stock, and replace certain maturing liabilities. The principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums, fee income, cash flow from our investment portfolio and liquid assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments.    Continuing disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets could have an adverse effect on our core business, our insurance operations. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy statutory capital requirements, generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs. Potentially, we may be forced to delay raising or be unable to raise capital, or we could be forced to bear an unattractive cost of capital, thus decreasing our profitability and reducing our financial flexibility. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially and adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets.    Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our profitability. Given the recent global economic slowdown, our investment portfolio may continue to suffer reduced returns or losses that could materially reduce our profitability.    Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability and significant fluctuations in the fixed maturity market could impair our profitability, financial condition and/or cash flows. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. In addition, certain factors affecting our business, such as volatility of claims experience, could force us to liquidate securities prior to maturity, causing us to incur capital losses. If we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is    14    Table of Contents  appropriately matched with our insurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such liabilities. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate Risk.”    The U.S. mortgage market has experienced unprecedented disruptions resulting from credit quality deterioration in a significant portion of loans originated. This has led to reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and increased investor yield requirements for those loans and securities. This continuing decline has resulted in restrictions in the resale markets for non-conforming loans and has had an adverse effect on retail mortgage lending operations in many markets, especially alternative documentation loans (typically offered to qualified borrowers who have relatively high credit scores but are not required to provide full documentation to support personal income and assets owned). These conditions may continue or worsen in the future. Although at December 31, 2009, only a small portion of our mortgage-backed securities were secured by sub-prime mortgage collateral, continued market disruption could ultimately impact our fixed maturity and commercial mortgage loan portfolio and may have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.    The performance of our investment portfolio is subject to continuing fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and market conditions.    Changes in interest rates can materially adversely affect the performance of some of our investments. Interest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fixed maturity and short-term investments represented 79% and 77% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investments” for additional information on the effect of fluctuations in interest rates.    The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. Because all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the market value of these securities are reflected in our balance sheet. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An increase in interest rates will increase the net unrealized loss position of our current investment portfolio.    We employ asset/liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility and to increase the likelihood that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due. Our asset/liability management strategies include asset/liability duration management, structuring our bond and commercial mortgage loan portfolios to limit the effects of prepayments and consistent monitoring of, and appropriate changes to, the pricing of our products.    Our asset/liability management strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility, and significant fluctuations in the level of interest rates may therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Our preneed insurance policies are generally whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits. In extended periods of declining interest rates or rising inflation, there may be compression in the spread between the death benefit growth rates on these policies and the investment income that we can earn, resulting in a negative spread. As a result, declining interest rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Inflation Risk” for additional information.    15    Table of Contents Assurant Employee Benefits calculates reserves for long-term disability and life waiver of premium claims using net present value calculations based on interest rates at the time claims are funded and expectations regarding future interest rates. Waiver of premium refers to a provision in a life insurance policy pursuant to which an insured with a disability that lasts for a specified period no longer has to pay premiums for the duration of the disability or for a stated period, during which time the life insurance coverage continues. If interest rates decline, reserves for open and/or new claims in Assurant Employee Benefits would need to be calculated using lower discount rates, thereby increasing the net present value of those claims and the required reserves. Depending on the magnitude of the decline, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, investment income may be lower than that assumed in setting premium rates.    Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses.    We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds, preferred stocks, leveraged loans, municipal bonds, and commercial mortgages. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the continued recognition of investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the corporate bonds included in the portfolio and by other factors that may result in the continued recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.    Further, the value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of a given issuer. As of December 31, 2009, fixed maturity securities represented 76% of the fair value of our total invested assets. Our fixed maturity portfolio also includes below investment grade securities (rated “BB” or lower by nationally recognized securities rating organizations). These investments comprise approximately 7% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2009 and generally provide higher expected returns, but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity investment portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Credit Risk” for additional information on the composition of our fixed maturity investment portfolio.    We currently invest in a small amount of equity securities (approximately 4% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2009). However, we have had higher percentages in the past and may make more such investments in the future. Investments in equity securities generally provide higher expected total returns, but present greater risk to preservation of capital than our fixed maturity investments. Recent volatility in the equity markets led, and may continue to lead, to a decline in the market value of our investments in equity securities.    For the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2009, the Company recognized net realized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities totaling $26,697 after tax and reported gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities of $176,659. Net realized losses generally emanate from two sources: losses related to sales and losses related to other-than-temporary impairments. If the recent economic downturn continues to negatively affect companies, industry sectors or countries, the Company may have additional realized and unrealized investment losses and further increases in other-than-temporary impairments. We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure investments that may be other-than-temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued, and any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the market value of a security has been less than cost, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, whether any collateral is held, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery for equity securities and the intent to sell or whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell for fixed maturity securities. However, the determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Changes in facts, circumstances, or critical assumptions could cause management to    16    Table of Contents  conclude that further impairments have occurred. This could lead to additional losses on investments. For further details on net investment losses and other-than-temporary-impairments, please see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investments.”    Derivative instruments generally present greater risk than fixed maturity investments or equity investments because of their greater sensitivity to market fluctuations. Since August 1, 2003, we have been utilizing derivative instruments to manage the exposure to inflation risk created by our preneed insurance policies that are tied to the CPI. However, the protection provided by these derivative instruments would be limited if there were a sharp increase in inflation on a sustained long-term basis which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Our commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments subject us to liquidity risk.    Our commercial mortgage loans on real estate investments (which represented approximately 11% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2009) are relatively illiquid. If we require extremely large amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices and/or in a timely manner.    The risk parameters of our investment portfolio may not assume an appropriate level of risk, thereby reducing our profitability and diminishing our ability to compete and grow.    In pricing our products and services, we incorporate assumptions regarding returns on our investments. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each of our operating segments. If we do not assume sufficient risk levels in our investment portfolio, the return on our investments may be insufficient to meet our pricing assumptions and profit targets over the long term. If, in response, we choose to increase our product prices, our ability to compete and grow may be diminished.    Environmental liability exposure may result from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments.    Liability under environmental protection laws resulting from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability. Under the laws of several states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of the cleanup. In some states, this kind of lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property, which would impair our ability to foreclose on that property should the related loan be in default. In addition, under the laws of some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for the costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at properties securing mortgage loans held by us. We also may face this liability after foreclosing on a property securing a mortgage loan held by us.    Our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims, which may require us to establish additional reserves that may materially reduce our earnings, profitability and capital.    We maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported claims and incurred but not reported claims (“IBNR”) as of the end of each accounting period. Reserves, whether calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), Statutory Accounting Principles (“SAP”) or accounting principles required in foreign jurisdictions, do not represent an exact calculation of exposure. Instead, they represent our best estimates, generally involving actuarial projections, of the ultimate settlement and administration costs for a claim or group of claims, based on our assessment of facts and circumstances known at the time of calculation. The adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. These variables are affected by external factors such as changes in the economic cycle, unemployment, changes in the    17    Table of Contents  social perception of the value of work, emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability, emerging health issues, new methods of treatment or accommodation, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes, as well as changes in claims handling procedures. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Reserve estimates are refined as experience develops. Adjustments to reserves, both positive and negative, are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated. Because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses, there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves. For example, during 2009, Assurant Health experienced substantial increases in utilization of medical services relative to the assumptions reflected in its December 31, 2008 reserves. As a result, earnings for the business in 2009 were negatively impacted. In general, future loss development could require reserves to be increased across all businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases were made.    We may be unable to accurately predict benefits, claims and other costs or to manage such costs through our loss mitigation methods, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Our profitability could vary depending on our ability to predict and price for benefits, claims and other costs, including but not limited to, medical and dental costs and the frequency and severity of property claims. Profitability also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through product design, underwriting criteria, utilization review or claims management and negotiation of favorable provider contracts. Utilization review is a process designed to control and limit medical expenses, which includes, among other things, requiring certification for admission to a health care facility and cost-effective ways of handling patients with catastrophic illnesses. Claims management entails the use of a variety of means to mitigate the extent of benefit costs while attempting to improve the quality of medical care provided to insureds and to assist them with vocational services. Our ability to predict and manage costs and claims, results of operations and financial condition, may be adversely affected by changes in health and dental care practices, inflation, new technologies, the cost of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, changes in the regulatory environment, economic factors, the occurrence of catastrophes and increased construction and repair-related costs.    The judicial and regulatory environments, changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy, market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs. The aging of the population, other demographic characteristics and advances in medical technology continue to contribute to rising health care costs. One or more of these factors, or other factors, could cause claims to substantially exceed our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Changing industry practices or changes in legal, judicial, social or environmental conditions may cause unexpected increases in claims and coverage. These issues could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent, increasing the number or size of claims, or both. We may be limited in our ability to respond to such changes by insurance regulations, existing contract terms, contract filing requirements, market conditions or other factors.    Catastrophe losses, including man-made catastrophe losses, could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes, particularly in our homeowners, life and other personal lines of business. We have experienced, and expect in the future to experience, catastrophe losses that materially reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, fires, epidemics and the long-term effects of climate change, or can be man-made catastrophes, including terrorist attacks or accidents such as    18    Table of Contents  airplane crashes. While the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property, the geographic concentration of insured lives, and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from future catastrophes.    Catastrophe losses can vary widely and could significantly exceed our expectations. They may cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or materially adversely affect our financial condition. Our ability to write new business also could be affected.    We depend on catastrophe property and life reinsurance to limit the size of property and life losses from a single event or multiple events, and life and disability reinsurance to limit our exposure on individual insured lives. As discussed further below, catastrophe reinsurance for our group insurance or property businesses could become unavailable or prohibitively expensive at some point in the future. In such a situation, we might also be adversely impacted by state regulations that prohibit us from excluding catastrophic exposures or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe-prone areas. These circumstances could expose us to catastrophe losses that materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Based on our research and modeling, the exact impact of the physical effects of climate change is uncertain. It is possible that changes in the global climate may cause long-term increases in the frequency and/or severity of storms, resulting in higher catastrophe losses, which could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.    The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most of our catastrophe claims in the past have related to homeowners and other personal lines coverages, which, for the year ended December 31, 2009, represented approximately 92% of our net earned premiums in our Assurant Specialty Property segment. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, approximately 40% of the insurance in force in our homeowners and other personal lines related to properties located in California, Florida and Texas. Since Assurant Specialty Property’s creditor-placed homeowners and creditor-placed manufactured housing insurance products are designed to automatically provide property coverage for client portfolios, our concentration in these areas may increase in the future. In addition, the withdrawal of other insurers from these or other states may lead to adverse selection and increased utilization of our products in these areas and may negatively impact our loss experience. Adverse selection refers to the process by which applicants representing greater than average risk seek to obtain insurance coverage at standard premium rates.    Pre-tax catastrophe losses in excess of $5,000 (before the benefits of reinsurance) that we have experienced in recent years include the following amounts:        •    total losses of approximately $214,000 incurred from the original date of loss through December 31, 2009 in connection with the 2008 Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and the 2008 California wildfires. Total reinsurance recoveries related to these events from inception through 2009 were approximately $81,000; and;        •    total losses of approximately $28,000 incurred from the original date of loss through December 31, 2009, in connection with the 2007 California wildfires. Total reinsurance recoveries related to these events since inception through 2009 were approximately $3,600.    No liquidation of investments was required in connection with these catastrophes as the claims were paid from current cash flow, cash on hand or short-term investments. Total losses do not include amounts paid in connection with the National Flood Insurance Program as we are either an administrator or are reinsured by the federal government and have no underwriting risk under the program.    19    Table of Contents Our group life and health insurance operations could be materially impacted by catastrophes such as a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, a pandemic or an epidemic that causes a widespread increase in mortality or disability rates or that causes an increase in the need for medical care. If the severity of such an event were sufficiently high, it could exceed our reinsurance coverage limits and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, with respect to our preneed insurance policies, the average age of policyholders is approximately 73 years. This group is more susceptible to certain epidemics than the overall population, and an epidemic resulting in a higher incidence of mortality could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    We may face the loss of premium income due to a large-scale business interruption caused by a catastrophe combined with legislative or regulatory reactions to the event. For example, following hurricanes in 2005, several states suspended premium payment obligations or precluded insurers from canceling coverage for nonpayment in defined areas. While the premiums uncollected were immaterial, a more serious catastrophe combined with a similar legislative or regulatory response could materially impact our ability to collect premiums and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Unanticipated changes in tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect our results.    During 2009, the Company had deferred tax assets related to realized and unrealized capital losses that were generated during 2009 and 2008. In accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company must determine whether its ability to realize the value of its deferred tax asset in the future is “more likely than not.” ASC Topic 740 states that a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company decreased its valuation allowance $16,000 during 2009 leaving a balance of $81,688. In determining whether the Company’s deferred tax asset is realizable, the Company weighed all available evidence, including both positive and negative evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The Company considered all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies.    To support the deferred tax asset, the Company relied on future taxable capital gain income from gross unrealized gains in its investment portfolio and on the use of certain tax planning strategies. These tax planning strategies are prudent and feasible, and include actions management ordinarily might not take but would take, if necessary, to realize a tax benefit for a capital loss carryforward before it expires.    In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, management made certain judgments relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards, levels of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The assumptions in making these judgments are updated periodically based on current business conditions affecting the Company and overall economic conditions. These management judgments are therefore subject to change based on factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in expected capital gain income in the foreseeable future and the ability of the Company to successfully execute its tax planning strategies. Management will continue to assess and determine the need for, and the amount of, the valuation allowance in subsequent periods in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 740. Each quarter, there is a risk that the Company may need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance, which could have a material impact on its results of operations and financial condition.    Fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies may materially and adversely impact our results of operations.    While most of our costs and revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a portion is denominated in foreign currencies. Because our financial results in certain countries are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars    20    Table of Contents  upon consolidation, the results of our operations may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. We do not currently hedge foreign currency risk. If the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency, the translation of these foreign-currency-denominated balances will result in increased net assets, net revenue, operating expenses, and net income or loss. Similarly, our net assets, net revenue, operating expenses, and net income or loss will decrease if the U.S. dollar strengthens against local currency. These fluctuations in currency exchange rates may result in gains and losses that materially and adversely impact our results of operations.    We face risks associated with our international operations.    Our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that we may not face in our domestic operations. For example, we may face the risk of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds; burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws; political or economic instability in countries in which we conduct business, including possible terrorist acts; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights; differences in cultural environments and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; exposure to local economic conditions and restrictions on the withdrawal of non-U.S. investment and earnings, including potentially substantial tax liabilities if we repatriate any of the cash generated by our international operations back to the U.S. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in that country. Additionally, in certain countries such as China, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by an inability to obtain an insurance license on a timely basis.    Reinsurance may not be available or adequate to protect us against losses, and we are subject to the credit risk of reinsurers.   As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various operating segments. Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we seek to renew or purchase. Reinsurance for certain types of catastrophes generally could become unavailable or prohibitively expensive for some of our businesses. Such changes could substantially increase our exposure to the risk of significant losses from natural or man-made catastrophes and could hinder our ability to write future business.    As part of our business, we have reinsured certain life, property and casualty and health risks to reinsurers. Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. Ceded reinsurance arrangements therefore do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. We are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. The inability to collect amounts due from reinsurers could materially adversely impact our results from operations and our financial position.    Our reinsurance facilities are generally subject to annual renewal. We may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and, even where highly desirable or necessary, we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain or structure new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Either of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    We have sold businesses through reinsurance that could again become our direct financial and administrative responsibility if the purchasing companies were to become insolvent.    In the past, we have sold, and in the future we may sell, businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties. For example, in 2001 we sold the insurance operations of our Fortis Financial Group (“FFG”) division to The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (“The Hartford”) and in 2000 we sold our Long Term Care (“LTC”) division to John Hancock Life Insurance Company (“John Hancock”), now a subsidiary of Manulife Financial    21    Table of Contents  Corporation. Most of the assets backing reserves coinsured under these sales are held in trusts or separate accounts. However, if the reinsurers became insolvent, we would be exposed to the risk that the assets in the trusts and/or the separate accounts would be insufficient to support the liabilities that would revert to us.    The A.M. Best ratings of The Hartford and John Hancock are currently A and A+, respectively. A.M. Best downgraded the issuer credit and financial strength ratings of The Hartford from A+ to A in February 2009 and maintains a negative outlook on its ratings.    We also face the risk of again becoming responsible for administering these businesses in the event of reinsurer insolvency. We do not currently have the administrative systems and capabilities to process these businesses. Accordingly, we would need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers. We might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Due to the structure of our commission program, we are exposed to risks related to the creditworthiness and reporting systems of some of our agents, third party administrators and clients in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property.    We are subject to the credit risk of some of the clients and/or agents with which we contract in Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property. We advance agents’ commissions as part of our preneed insurance product offerings. These advances are a percentage of the total face amount of coverage. There is a one-year payback provision against the agency if death or lapse occurs within the first policy year. If SCI, which receives the largest shares of such agent commissions, were unable to fulfill its payback obligations, this could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.    In addition, some of our clients, third party administrators and agents collect and report premiums and/or pay claims on our behalf. If, for any reason, these parties fail to remit all premiums collected or fail to pay claims on our behalf on a timely and accurate basis, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.    A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P rate the financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease.    Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. A.M. Best rates most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. Moody’s rates six of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries and S&P rates seven of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. These ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P, and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain them. In 2009 for example, S&P lowered its counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of two of our life insurance subsidiaries from A to BBB+ due to the recent operating performance of Assurant Health. In addition, S&P lowered its counterparty credit rating of Assurant, Inc. from BBB+ to BBB, citing reduced earnings diversification. S&P has placed a negative outlook on all Assurant ratings due to pressures on our various businesses from the economic climate. We believe that because of recent economic developments that have negatively affected the entire insurance industry, we are more susceptible to ratings downgrades than in prior years. For more information on the specific A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P ratings of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, see “Item 1—Business—Ratings.”    If our ratings are lowered from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moody’s, or S&P, our competitive position in the respective insurance industry segments could be materially adversely impacted and it could be more difficult for us to market our products. Rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future due to concerns regarding, among other things, our liquidity or solvency, the competitive environment, the adequacy of our reserves, the outcome of pending litigation or regulatory investigations. They may also change    22    Table of Contents  their methodology or requirements for determining ratings, or they may become more conservative in assigning ratings. Ratings agencies or regulators could also increase capital requirements for the Company or its subsidiaries.    Since customers and their advisors place importance on our financial strength ratings, we may lose customers and compete less successfully if we are downgraded. In addition, ratings impact our ability to attract investment capital on favorable terms. If our financial strength ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moody’s, or S&P, our cost of borrowing would likely increase, our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.    As of December 31, 2009, contracts representing approximately 16% of Assurant Solutions’ and 22% of Assurant Specialty Property’s net earned premiums and fee income contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings ranging from “A” or better to “B” or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts or fail to renew them if the subsidiaries’ ratings fall below these minimums. Under our marketing agreement with SCI, American Memorial Life Insurance Company (“AMLIC”), one of our subsidiaries, is required to maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of “B” or better throughout the term of the agreement. If AMLIC fails to maintain this rating for a period of 180 days, SCI may terminate the agreement.    Additionally, certain contracts in the DRMS business, representing approximately 4% of Assurant Employee Benefits’ net earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2009, contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings of “A-” or better. DRMS clients may terminate the agreements and in some instances recapture in force business if the ratings of applicable subsidiaries fall below “A-”. Termination or failure to renew these contracts could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    We face significant competitive pressures in our businesses, which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at rates that will allow us to be profitable.    In each of our lines of business, we compete with other insurance companies or service providers, depending on the line and products, although we do not believe that any single competitor competes against us in all of the business lines in which we operate.    Competitors for Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property include national and regional insurance companies, managing and general agencies, and financial institutions. The main competitors for Assurant Health include health insurance companies, HMOs and the Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans in the states in which we write business. In Assurant Employee Benefits, competitors include benefits and life insurance companies, dental managed care entities and not-for-profit dental plans.    Competition in our businesses is based on many factors, including quality of service, product features, price, scope of distribution, scale, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete, and will continue to compete, for customers and distributors with many insurance companies and other financial services companies. We compete not only for business and individual customers, employer and other group customers, but also for agents and distribution relationships. Some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products than our subsidiaries, may have a greater diversity of distribution resources, may have better brand recognition, may from time to time have more competitive pricing, may have lower cost structures or, with respect to insurers, may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete.    Many of our insurance products, particularly our group benefits and group health insurance policies, are underwritten annually. There is a risk that group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than renewing coverage with us. Competition may, as a result, adversely affect the persistency of our policies, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.    23    Table of Contents In Assurant Solutions, as a result of state and federal regulatory developments and changes in prior years, certain financial institutions are able to offer a product called debt protection which is similar to our credit insurance product. Financial institutions are also able to affiliate with other insurance companies in order to offer services similar to our own. This has resulted in new competitors, some of whom have significant financial resources, entering some of our markets. As financial institutions gain experience with debt protection administration, their reliance on third party administrators, such as Assurant Solutions, may diminish, thus reducing our revenue and profits.    Some of our competitors may have a lower target for returns on capital allocated to their business than we do, which may enable them to price their products and services lower than we do. In addition, from time to time, companies enter the markets in which we operate, thereby increasing competition. For example, several large insurance companies have recently entered the market for individual health insurance products. We may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices, or for other reasons, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    In certain markets, we compete with organizations that have a substantial market share. In particular, certain large competitors of Assurant Health may be able to obtain favorable financial arrangements from health care providers that are not available to us, putting us at a competitive disadvantage and potentially adversely impacting our revenues and profits.    New competition could also cause the supply of insurance to change, which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and thereby adversely affect our underwriting results. Although there are some impediments facing potential competitors who wish to enter the markets we serve, the entry of new competitors into our markets can occur, affording our customers significant flexibility in moving to other insurance providers.    The failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information systems could adversely affect our business.    Our business is dependent upon the ability to keep current with technological advances. Our ability to keep our systems integrated with those of our clients is critical to the success of our business. If we do not effectively maintain our systems and update them to address technological advancements, our relationships and ability to do business with our clients may be adversely affected.    Our business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different systems for our various businesses. We must commit significant resources to maintain and enhance existing information systems and develop new systems that allow us to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry, regulatory and legal standards and changing customer preferences. A failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or a failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems and eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or our ability to do business in particular jurisdictions. If we do not effectively maintain adequate systems, we could experience adverse consequences, including poor pricing; underwriting and reserving decisions; the loss of existing customers; difficulty attracting new customers; customer, provider and agent disputes; regulatory problems such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; internal control problems; exposure to litigation; security breaches resulting in loss of data; or increases in administrative expenses.    Our management information, internal control and financial reporting systems may need further enhancements and development to satisfy continuing financial and other reporting requirements.    Failure to protect our clients’ confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of reputation and customers, reduction to our profitability and/or subject us to fines, litigation and penalties.    Our businesses are subject to a variety of privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations. For example, the collection and use of patient data in our Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits segments is the    24    Table of Contents  subject of national and state legislation, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the privacy provisions contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “HITECH Act”), and certain of our activities are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our vendors, servicing companies, and clients. These obligations generally require us, in accordance with applicable laws, to protect such information to the same extent that we protect our own confidential information. The actions we take to protect such confidential information vary by operating segment and may include, among other things, training and educating our employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential information, actively monitoring our record retention plans and any changes in privacy and compliance requirements of the jurisdictions in which our regulated subsidiaries do business, drafting appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that involves proprietary and confidential information, regularly monitoring and assessing our third party vendors for compliance with privacy and security requirements, maintaining and utilizing appropriately secure storage facilities for tangible records, and limiting access to tangible records and electronic information.    We maintain a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect confidential information, including payment card information. If we do not properly comply with privacy and security laws and regulations that require us to protect confidential information, we could experience adverse consequences, including loss of customers and related revenue, regulatory problems (including fines and penalties), loss of reputation and civil litigation.    See “—Risks Related to Our Industry—Costs of compliance with privacy and security laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations.”    Our ability to achieve our desired market positions may be significantly impaired if we do not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures, and even if we do, we may not successfully integrate any such acquired companies or successfully promote such ventures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.    From time to time, we evaluate possible acquisition transactions and the start-up of complementary businesses. While our business model is not dependent upon acquisitions or new insurance ventures, the time frame for achieving or expanding our market positions can be significantly shortened through opportune acquisitions or new insurance ventures. Historically, acquisitions and new ventures have played a significant role in the growth of some of our businesses. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or new venture opportunities, or that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms, or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful. Any deficiencies in the process of integrating companies we may acquire or successfully promote such new ventures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Acquisitions entail a number of risks including, among other things, inaccurate assessment of liabilities; difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; difficulties in integrating systems and personnel; failure to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow; an increase in our indebtedness; and a limitation in our ability to access additional capital when needed. Our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    The inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts could harm our ability to meet our obligations and pay future stockholder dividends.    As a holding company whose principal assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, dividends to stockholders (including any dividends on our common stock) and corporate expenses. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and to make such other payments in the future will depend on their statutory surplus, future statutory earnings and regulatory    25    Table of Contents  restrictions. Except to the extent that we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, claims of the subsidiaries’ creditors, including policyholders, have priority over creditors’ claims with respect to the assets and earnings of the subsidiaries. If any of our subsidiaries should become insolvent, liquidate or otherwise reorganize, our creditors and stockholders will have no right to proceed against their assets or to cause the liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up of the subsidiary under applicable liquidation, bankruptcy or winding-up laws. The applicable insurance laws of the jurisdiction where each of our insurance subsidiaries is domiciled would govern any proceedings relating to that subsidiary, and the insurance authority of that jurisdiction would act as a liquidator or rehabilitator for the subsidiary. Both creditors and policyholders of the subsidiary would be entitled to payment in full from the subsidiary’s assets before we, as a stockholder, would be entitled to receive any distribution from the subsidiary.    The payment of dividends to us by any of our regulated operating subsidiaries in excess of a certain amount (i.e., extraordinary dividends) must be approved by the subsidiary’s domiciliary state department of insurance. Ordinary dividends, for which no regulatory approval is generally required, are limited to amounts determined by a formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled is based on the prior year’s statutory net income or 10% of the statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year. Some states limit ordinary dividends to the greater of these two amounts, others limit them to the lesser of these two amounts and some states exclude prior year realized capital gains from prior year net income in determining ordinary dividend capacity. Some states have an additional stipulation that dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus. If insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiaries to us (such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would be adverse to policyholders or creditors, the regulators may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval. No assurance can be given that there will not be future regulatory actions restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. If the ability of insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements, it could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock and/or service our debt and pay our other corporate expenses. For more information on the maximum amount our subsidiaries could pay us in 2009 without regulatory approval, see “Item 5—Market For Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Dividend Policy.”    Our credit facilities also contain limitations on our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders if we are in default or such dividend payments would cause us to be in default of the credit facilities.    The success of our business strategy depends on the continuing service of key executives and the members of our senior management team, and any failure to adequately provide for the succession of senior management and other key executives could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.    Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key executives. While we have succession plans in place and change of control employment agreements with senior management and certain key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us. In addition, if we fail to effectively retain members of senior management and other key executives, such failure may have an adverse effect on the retention of employees and others in senior management.    Risks Related to Our Industry    Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.    In addition to the occasional employment-related litigation to which businesses are subject, we are a defendant in actions arising out of, and are involved in, various regulatory investigations and examinations relating to our insurance and other related business operations. We are subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by insurance departments in jurisdictions in which we do business. These insurance departments have    26    Table of Contents  broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business and, in particular, monitor the manner in which an insurance company offers, sells and administers its products. Therefore, we may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:        •    disputes over coverage or claims adjudication including, but not limited to, pre-existing conditions in individual medical contracts and rescissions of policies;        •    disputes over claim payment amounts that may not be in compliance with individual state regulatory requirements;        •    disputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance, underwriting and compensation arrangements;        •    disputes with our agents, producers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims;        •    disputes concerning historical premiums charged by companies acquired by us for coverage that may have been based on factors such as race;        •    disputes relating to customers regarding the ratio of premiums to benefits in our various operating segments;        •    disputes alleging packaging of credit insurance products with other products provided by financial institutions;        •    disputes relating to certain excess of loss programs in the London markets;        •    disputes with taxation and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities;        •    disputes relating to certain businesses we have acquired or disposed of;        •    periodic examinations of compliance with applicable federal securities laws;        •    disputes relating to customers’ claims that the customer was not aware of the full cost of insurance or that insurance was in fact being purchased; and        •    industry-wide investigations regarding business practices including, but not limited to, the use of finite reinsurance and the marketing and refunding of insurance policies or certificates of insurance.    The prevalence and outcomes of any such actions cannot be predicted, and no assurances can be given that such actions or any litigation would not materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we were to experience difficulties with our relationship with a regulatory body in a given jurisdiction, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business in that jurisdiction.    In addition, plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against insurance and related companies. Current and future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure to these types of claims. Multiparty or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic, non-economic or punitive damage awards. The loss of even one of these claims, if it resulted in a significant damage award or a detrimental judicial ruling could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. This risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain. We cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our businesses.    We have experienced an increase in regulatory scrutiny of our medical contract coverage denial practices, particularly in our health business. These regulatory examinations and investigations could result in, among other things, changes in our business practices and claims handling practices, increases in policy liabilities, reopening of closed or denied claims, changes in governance or other oversight procedures, fines and other actions by the    27    Table of Contents  regulatory agencies. Such results, singly or in combination, could harm our reputation, cause negative publicity, adversely affect our ratings, or impair our ability to sell or retain insurance policies, thereby adversely affecting our business.    Another focus of regulators was the accounting treatment for finite reinsurance contracts. Some state regulators have made routine inquiries to some of our insurance subsidiaries regarding finite reinsurance. On January 21, 2010, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with the previously disclosed SEC investigation into a finite reinsurance arrangement entered into by the Company. In the complaint, the SEC charged the Company with violating Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-11 and 13a-13 thereunder. As previously disclosed by the Company in a Current Report on Form 8-K on January 21, 2010, the Company entered into a settlement with the SEC in which the Company consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a judgment requiring payment of a civil penalty of $3,500 and enjoining the Company from violating the aforementioned federal securities laws. The court approved the settlement in a final judgment entered on January 25, 2010 and the Company has paid the penalty.    As part of the settlement, the SEC granted permanent relief to two subsidiaries of the Company, exempting them from limitations on serving as depositors to investment companies under Section 9(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If the subsidiaries fail to continue to meet the conditions in the application for permanent relief, then they could lose their ability to act as depositors of the separate accounts related to the FFG businesses sold to the Hartford in 2001. This could result in significant costs to restructure the modified coinsurance structure currently in place.    We cannot predict at this time the effect that current litigation, investigations and regulatory activity will have on the insurance industry or our business. Given our position in the insurance industry, it is possible that we will become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed against us. Our involvement in any investigations and lawsuits would cause us to incur legal costs and, if we were found to have violated any laws, we could be required to pay fines and damages, perhaps in material amounts. In addition, we could be adversely affected by the negative publicity for the insurance industry related to any such proceedings, and by any new industry-wide regulations or practices that may result from any such proceedings.    The insurance and related businesses in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity, which may negatively impact our financial results.    We communicate with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers. There may be a perception that some of these purchasers may be unsophisticated and in need of consumer protection. Accordingly, from time to time, consumer advocacy groups or the media may focus attention on our products and services, thereby subjecting us to negative publicity.    We may also be negatively impacted if another company in one of our industries or in a related industry engages in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses. Negative publicity may also result from judicial inquiries, unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits, or regulatory or governmental action with respect to our products, services and industry commercial practices. Negative publicity may cause increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation or enforcement action by civil and criminal authorities. Additionally, negative publicity may increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services, constraining our ability to price our products appropriately for the risks we are assuming, requiring us to change the products and services we offer, or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate.    The insurance industry is cyclical, which may impact our results.    The insurance industry is cyclical. Although no two cycles are the same, insurance industry cycles have typically lasted for periods ranging from two to ten years. The segments of the insurance markets in which we    28    Table of Contents  operate have historically tended not to be correlated to each other, with each segment having its own cyclicality, whereby periods of intense price competition may adversely impact revenues and profitability. The upheaval in the global economy during 2008 and 2009 has been much more widespread and has impacted all the businesses in which we operate. We expect to see continued cyclicality in some or all of our businesses in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    We are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations, which increase our costs and could restrict the conduct of our business.    Our operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders. To that end, the laws of the various states and other jurisdictions establish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such things as:        •    licensing and authorizing companies and agents to transact business;        •    regulating capital and surplus and dividend requirements;        •    regulating underwriting limitations;        •    regulating companies’ ability to enter and exit markets;        •    imposing statutory accounting requirements and annual statement disclosures;        •    approving policy forms and mandating certain insurance benefits;        •    restricting companies’ ability to provide, terminate or cancel certain coverages;        •    regulating premium rates, including the ability to increase or maintain premium rates;        •    regulating trade and claims practices;        •    regulating certain transactions between affiliates;        •    regulating the content of disclosures to consumers;        •    regulating the type, amounts and valuation of investments;        •    mandating assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds and the ability to recover such assessments in the future through premium increases; and        •    regulating market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents.    Our non-insurance operations and certain aspects of our insurance operations are subject to various federal and state regulation including state and federal consumer protection and other laws. Similarly, our foreign subsidiaries are subject to legislation and regulation in the countries in which they are domiciled and in some cases where their end customers are domiciled. We therefore face the challenge of conducting business in a multi-national setting with varying regulations.    Assurant Health is required by some jurisdictions to provide coverage to persons who would not be considered eligible insurance risks under standard underwriting criteria. Each of these jurisdictions dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such applicants. Our share of these risks is mandatory and is generally a function of our share of the applicable insurance market in each jurisdiction. These programs expose Assurant Health to the risk of losses in the jurisdictions in which they are still effective. In addition, HIPAA requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals and small groups (generally groups with 50 or fewer employees) and limits exclusions based on pre-existing conditions. See also “—Risks Related to Our Industry—Costs of compliance with privacy and security laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations.” If regulatory requirements impede our ability to raise premium rates, utilize new policy forms or terminate, deny or cancel coverage in any of our businesses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.    29    Table of Contents An insurer’s ability to write new business is partly a function of its statutory surplus. Maintaining appropriate levels of surplus as measured by SAP is considered important by insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers’ claims-paying abilities and financial strength. Failure to maintain certain levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, a downgrade by rating agencies, or enforcement action by regulatory authorities.    We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant regulators’ interpretation of the laws and regulations. Also, some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals or to limit or restrain operations in their jurisdiction. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from operating, limit some or all of our activities, or financially penalize us. These types of actions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    Changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.    Legislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. For example, some states have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    Legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm our subsidiaries and us include, but are not limited to:        •    legislation that holds insurance companies or managed care companies liable for adverse consequences of medical or dental decisions;        •    limitations or imposed reductions on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies;        •    increases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements;        •    impositions of fines, taxes or other penalties for improper licensing, the failure to promptly pay claims, however defined, or other regulatory violations;        •    increased licensing requirements;        •    restrictions on the ability to offer certain types of insurance products;        •    increased disclosure requirements on certain types of products;        •    prohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk-sharing arrangements;        •    imposition of more stringent standards of review of our coverage determinations;        •    new benefit mandates;        •    increased regulation relating to the sale of individual health insurance;        •    limitations on our ability to build appropriate provider networks and, as a result, manage health care and utilization due to “any willing provider” legislation, which requires us to take any provider willing to accept our reimbursement;        •    limitations on the ability to manage health care and utilization due to direct access laws that allow insureds to seek services directly from specialty medical providers without referral by a primary care provider; and        •    restriction of solicitation of insurance consumers by funeral board laws for prefunded funeral insurance coverage.    30    Table of Contents In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws. Although the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas could significantly impact the insurance industry and us. The American Counsel of Life Insurers and others are promoting the introduction of an optional federal charter for certain insurers. Moreover, federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our profitability. Additionally, there have been attempts by the NAIC and several states to limit the use of discretionary clauses in policy forms. The elimination of discretionary clauses could increase our costs under our life, health and disability insurance policies. New interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously. In addition, the NAIC’s proposed expansion of the Market Conduct Annual Statement could increase the likelihood of examinations of insurance companies with niche markets. Court decisions that impact the insurance industry could result in the release of previously protected confidential and privileged information by departments of insurance, which could increase the risk of litigation.    While health insurance is generally regulated at the state level, a number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal level over the past several years that could impose added burdens on Assurant Health. During 2009, health care reform was a major initiative of President Obama and the U.S. Congress. Bills that would address the affordability and availability of health insurance and reduce the number of uninsureds are under consideration in the U.S. Congress and in many states. Certain health reform legislation was passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009 and by the Senate on December 24, 2009. These proposals vary, but both include new taxes on the health insurance industry, individual insurance requirements, an expansion of eligibility under Medicaid and other programs, minimum medical benefit ratios for health plans, mandatory issuance of insurance coverage and requirements that would restrict the ability of insurers and health plans to adjust premiums based on risk assessments. These proposals may impose new taxes on us that would constitute a significant portion of our income and/or cause premium increases for our members. These proposals may also have some impact on the dental business line at Assurant Employee Benefits. In connection with the consideration by the U.S. Congress of health reform proposals, we have provided, and may continue to provide, information and testimony to certain committees and/or subcommittees of the U.S. Congress regarding our business practices, including executive compensation and rescission practices. At this time, we cannot predict whether health care reform legislation will be enacted and in what form, but if enacted, such reform could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability, require us to modify the way in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. Additionally, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by such reform.    With respect to Assurant Specialty Property, federal legislative proposals regarding National Catastrophe Insurance, if adopted, could reduce the business need for some of the property and casualty related products provided by Assurant Specialty Property. Additionally, as the U.S. Congress continues to respond to the recent housing foreclosure crisis, it could enact legislation placing additional barriers on creditor-placed insurance.    The U.S. Congress is also considering comprehensive proposals to reform the existing regulatory structure of the financial services industry. Certain proposals currently under consideration by the Senate aim to increase federal oversight of the financial services industry by, among other things, creating an independent consumer financial protection agency, establishing a financial services oversight council responsible for monitoring and assessing systemic risk in the financial industry, and providing resolution authority for the orderly dissolution of failing financial services companies.    The NAIC has adopted the Annual Financial Reporting Model Act (which prior to revision was known as the Model Audit Rule), that, when adopted by states, will impose internal controls similar to those mandated by    31    Table of Contents  Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (which we refer to as SOX 404), with some differences for insurance companies. The latest date of adoption by any state, as prescribed by the NAIC, is 2010. These SOX 404 type controls will add an additional layer of internal review for insurer financial statements and subject insurers to varying levels of review by state insurance regulators. This could result in potential exposure for fines and penalties for non-compliance. In addition, the NAIC has adopted changes to statutory accounting principles, which may negatively impact insurer financial reporting requirements and the profitability of insurance operations on a statutory basis.    We cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation, regulations or NAIC initiatives may have on the conduct of our business. The insurance laws or regulations adopted or amended from time to time may be more restrictive or may result in materially higher costs than current requirements.    It is difficult to predict the effect of the current investigations in connection with insurance industry practices. See the preceding section entitled “—Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.”   Costs of compliance with privacy and security laws could adversely affect our business and results of operations.    State privacy laws, particularly those with “opt-in” clauses, or provisions that enable an individual to elect information sharing instead of being automatically included, can affect all our businesses. These laws make it harder for our affiliated businesses to share information for marketing purposes, such as generating new sales leads and participating in joint marketing arrangements.    Similarly, the federal and various state “do not solicit” lists could pose a litigation risk to Assurant Solutions. Even an inadvertent failure to comply with consumers’ requests to be added to the “do not solicit” list could result in litigation.    Furthermore, foreign privacy regulations could limit the efficiency of our foreign operations and reduce profitability. For example, under European Union directives, insurers domiciled in the European Union may not send data that may contain personal information to the U.S. unless certain controls relating to the care and control of the information exist.    HIPAA, the HITECH Act, and the implementing regulations that have been adopted impose obligations for issuers of health and dental insurance coverage and health and dental benefit plan sponsors. HIPAA and the HITECH Act also establish requirements for maintaining the confidentiality and security of individually identifiable health information and standards for electronic health care transactions. As have other entities in the health care industry, we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs in complying with the requirements of HIPAA, the HITECH Act, and the accompanying regulations.    HIPAA and the HITECH Act are far-reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under these laws continue to evolve. Consequently, our efforts to measure, monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with HIPAA and the HITECH laws are ongoing. Failure to comply with HIPAA and the HITECH Act could result in regulatory fines, civil lawsuits, and actions by state attorneys general. Knowing and intentional violations of these rules may also result in federal criminal penalties.    Beginning in early 2005, several large organizations became subjects of intense public scrutiny due to high-profile data security breaches involving sensitive financial and health information. These events focused national attention on identity theft and the duty of organizations to notify impacted consumers in the event of a data security breach. Several federal bills are pending in Congress and currently 45 states have passed legislation requiring customer notification in the event of a data security breach. Most state laws take their lead from recently enacted California Civil Code Section 1798.82, which requires businesses that conduct business in    32    Table of Contents  California to disclose any breach of security to any resident whose unencrypted data is believed to have been disclosed. Additionally, the HITECH Act contains the first federal security breach law and imposes a duty on Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits to provide notice if there is a data security breach of protected health information. These breaches are annually reported to the Department of Health and Human Services. Several significant legal, operational and reputational risks exist with regard to data breach and customer notification. Federal pre-emption relating to this issue may reduce our compliance costs. Nonetheless, a breach of data security requiring public notification can result in regulatory fines, penalties or sanctions, civil lawsuits, loss of reputation, loss of customers and reduction of our profitability.    Risks Related to Our Common Stock    Given the recent economic climate, our stock may be subject to stock price and trading volume volatility. The price of our common stock could fluctuate or decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.    During 2008 and early 2009, the stock markets experienced significant price and trading volume volatility. Company-specific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may have caused this volatility. Our stock price could materially fluctuate or decrease in response to a number of events and factors, including but not limited to:        •    quarterly variations in operating results;        •    catastrophes, terrorist attacks and epidemics;        •    changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;        •    operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;        •    press releases or negative publicity relating to our competitors or us or relating to trends in our markets;        •    regulatory changes and adverse outcomes from litigation and government or regulatory investigations;        •    sales of stock by insiders;        •    changes in our financial strength ratings;        •    limitations on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies; and        •    increases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements.    In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.    Applicable laws, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, and contract provisions may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests.    State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.    Additionally, we may, under some circumstances involving a change of control, be obligated to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and other agreements. We or any possible acquirer may not have available financial resources necessary to repay such indebtedness in those circumstances. If we or any possible acquirer cannot repay our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility or other agreements in the    33    Table of Contents  event of a change of control (as defined in such agreements), that may constitute an event of default resulting in acceleration of indebtedness and potential cross-default under other agreements. The threat of this could have the effect of delaying or preventing transactions involving a change of control, including transactions in which our stockholders would receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices, or which they otherwise may deem to be in their best interests.    State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors. These provisions may facilitate director entrenchment, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.    The following provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws:        •    permit our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;        •    divide our Board of Directors into three classes;        •    limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors;        •    prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on our Board of Directors;        •    prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders and from taking action by written consent;        •    impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings;        •    require the approval by the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter for the stockholders to amend certain provisions of our by-laws and certificate of incorporation.    In addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an “interested stockholder” to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.    Applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our Company.    Before a person can acquire control of an insurance company in the U.S. and certain other countries, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the jurisdiction where the insurer is domiciled. For example, generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. However, the State of Florida, in which certain of our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, defines control as 5% or more. Because a person acquiring 5% or more of our common stock would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our Florida subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of Florida would apply to such transaction and at 10%, the laws of many other states would likely apply to such a transaction. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, a state insurance commissioner will typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity of the applicant’s board of directors and executive officers, the applicant’s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control.   34    Table of Contents Item 1B.
