Item 1A. Risk Factors."These factors (among others) could affect our financial performance and cause actual results to differ materially from historical earnings and those presently anticipated and projected. We will not undertake and we specifically disclaim any obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of events, whether or not anticipated. In that respect, we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.Item 1.BusinessWe are a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms, which we refer to as our "Affiliates." We pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the growth of our existing Affiliates, as well as through additional investments in boutique investment management firms. In addition, we provide centralized assistance to our Affiliates in strategic matters, marketing, distribution, product development and operations.We hold meaningful equity interests in each of our Affiliates. The remaining equity interests are retained by management of the Affiliate, thereby aligning our interests and enabling management to continue to participate in the Affiliate's long-term future growth. Our innovative investment approach provides a degree of liquidity and diversification to principal owners of boutique investment management firms, and also addresses the succession and ownership transition issues facing many founders and principal owners. Our partnership approach also ensures that our Affiliates maintain operational autonomy in managing their businesses, thereby preserving the Affiliate's entrepreneurial culture and independence. In particular, our structures are designed to:•maintain and enhance Affiliate management equity incentives directly in their own firms;•preserve each Affiliate's distinct culture, investment focus and operational autonomy; and•provide Affiliates with access to the resources and scale of a global asset management company in areas such as global distribution, operations, compliance and technology.Although we invest in boutique investment management firms that we anticipate will grow independently and without our assistance, we are committed to helping Affiliates identify opportunities for growth and leverage the benefits of economies of scale. We believe that substantial opportunities to make investments in additional high-quality boutique investment management firms will continue to arise as their founders seek to institutionalize their businesses through broader equity ownership, or approach retirement age and begin to plan for succession. We identify the highest quality boutiques based on our thorough understanding of the asset management industry and have developed long-term relationships with a significant number of these firms. Within our target universe, we seek the strongest and most stable boutiques with the best growth prospects, especially with respect to the growth potential for their product area(s) of focus, such as global and emerging markets equities and alternative strategies. These boutiques are typically characterized by a strong multi-generational management team with focused investment discipline, entrepreneurial culture and a commitment to building longer-term success, and by a diverse set of products sold across multiple distribution channels. We are focused on investing in the highest quality boutique investment management firms globally, including traditional, alternative and wealth management firms, specializing in an array of investment styles and asset classes. We anticipate that we will have significant additional investment opportunities across the global asset management industry, most often in independent boutique investment management firms, but also including the potential for investments resulting from subsidiary divestitures, secondary sales and other special situations.Investment Management Operations1Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2014, we managed $620.2 billion in assets through our Affiliates ($626 billion including a pending investment) across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in three principal distribution channels: Institutional, Mutual Fund and High Net Worth. We believe that our diversification across distribution channels, Affiliates, asset classes, investment styles and geographies helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments.A summary of selected financial data attributable to our operations for each distribution channel is included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Institutional Distribution ChannelThrough our Affiliates, we manage assets for large institutional investors world-wide including sovereign wealth funds, foundations, endowments, and retirement plans for corporations and municipalities.Our institutional investment services and products are distributed by sales and marketing professionals developing new institutional business through direct sales efforts and established relationships with pension consultants around the world. Our global distribution platform operates in key markets to extend the reach of our Affiliates' own business development efforts, including offices in Sydney, serving institutional investors in Australia and New Zealand; London and Zurich, serving institutional investors in the United Kingdom and continental Europe; Dubai, serving institutional investors in the Middle East; and Hong Kong, serving institutional investors in Asia. Our efforts are designed to provide our Affiliates with the necessary resources and expertise to ensure that their products and services are responsive to the evolving demands of the global marketplace. Our Affiliates currently manage assets for non-U.S. clients in more than 50 countries, including all major developed markets.Mutual Fund Distribution ChannelThrough our Affiliates, we provide advisory or sub-advisory services to mutual funds, UCITS and other retail-oriented products. These funds are distributed globally to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries, including independent investment advisors, retirement plan sponsors, broker-dealers, major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments.Through AMG Funds, our U.S. retail distribution platform, we provide access to the U.S. mutual fund wholesale distribution channel and wrap sponsor platforms, and provide our Affiliates with a single point of contact for retail intermediaries such as banks, brokerage firms and other sponsored platforms.High Net Worth Distribution ChannelThrough our Affiliates, we provide advisory services to ultra-high net worth individuals and family trusts. Direct services to these clients include customized investment counseling, investment management and fiduciary services. AMG Wealth Partners extends and tailors our innovative partnership approach to equity investments in ultra-high net worth wealth management firms.Also through our Affiliates, we provide advisory services to high net worth individuals through managed account relationships with intermediaries such as brokerage firms and, through our global distribution platform, we provide our Affiliates with enhanced managed account distribution and administration capabilities to individual managed account clients.Diversification of Assets under ManagementThe following table provides information regarding the composition of our assets under management:2Table of Contents December 31, 2012 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2014(in billions)Assets underManagement Percentageof Total Assets underManagement Percentageof Total Assets underManagement Percentageof TotalDistribution Channels           Institutional$254.3 59% $300.6 56% $355.6 57%Mutual Fund121.9 28% 169.4 32% 188.4 31%High Net Worth55.6 13% 67.3 12% 76.2 12%Total$431.8 100% $537.3 100% $620.2 100%Asset Class           Equity(1)$271.2 63% $351.8 65% $390.4 63%Alternative(2)105.1 24% 128.4 24% 171.2 28%Fixed Income55.5 13% 57.1 11% 58.6 9%Total$431.8 100% $537.3 100% $620.2 100%Geography(3)           Global$226.3 52% $278.8 52% $324.2 52%Domestic154.2 36% 202.0 38% 234.7 38%Emerging Markets51.3 12% 56.5 10% 61.3 10%Total$431.8 100% $537.3 100% $620.2 100%_______________________________________________________________________________(1)The Equity asset class includes equity, balanced and asset allocation products.(2)The Alternative asset class includes private equity, multi-strategy, market neutral equity and hedge products.(3)The Geography of a particular investment product describes the general location of its investment holdings.Our Structure and Relationship with AffiliatesWe establish and maintain long-term partnerships with our Affiliates, believing that Affiliate equity ownership (along with AMG's ownership) aligns our interests and provides a powerful incentive for the principal owners of our Affiliates to continue to grow their businesses. Our partnership approach allows for the principal owners of our Affiliates to retain equity sufficient to address their particular needs and to maintain operational autonomy in managing their businesses, thereby preserving their entrepreneurial culture and independence. Although the equity structure of each investment is tailored to meet the needs of a particular Affiliate, in all cases we maintain a meaningful equity interest in the firm, with the remaining equity interests retained by Affiliate management. The contractual structures of our investments vary from Affiliate to Affiliate, reflecting our tailored partnership approach. Where we own a majority of the equity interests of a firm, we typically use structures referred to as revenue sharing arrangements where a percentage of revenue is allocable to fund operating expenses, including compensation (the "Operating Allocation"), while the remaining revenue (the "Owners' Allocation") is allocable to us and Affiliate management. In other revenue sharing arrangements, we own a minority interest that allocates a percentage of the Affiliate's revenue to us, with the remaining revenue available to the Affiliate to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the other owners. Under our revenue sharing arrangements, our contractual share of revenue generally has priority over allocations to Affiliate management. Certain of our Affiliates operate under profit-based arrangements through which we receive a share of profits as cash flow, rather than a percentage of revenue through a typical revenue sharing agreement. As a result, we participate in increases or decreases in the margin of such firms. From time to time, we may consider changes to the structure of our relationship with an Affiliate in order to better support the Affiliate's growth strategy. Many of our operating agreements provide Affiliate management with conditional rights ("put rights") that enable them to gradually sell their retained equity interests to us at certain intervals over time. These agreements also provide us conditional rights that require Affiliate management to sell their equity interests to us ("call rights"). These rights enhance our ability to keep our ownership within a desired range and provide Affiliate management with sufficient incentives to grow and improve their business and create equity value for themselves. These conditional rights help facilitate our ability to provide equity ownership opportunities in our Affiliates to a broader group of management. In cases where we own a minority interest, we don't typically have such put and call arrangements.When we own a majority of the equity interests of a firm, we consolidate the Affiliate's results. When we hold a minority investment, we generally use the equity method of accounting. Consistent with the equity method of accounting, we do not 3Table of Contentsconsolidate the operating results (including the revenue) of these Affiliates and, therefore, increases or decreases in these firms' assets under management and the resulting changes in advisory fees and performance fees will not affect our reported revenue. Investments in Affiliates Our target investment universe includes more than 1,800 investment management firms globally, and we have established long-term relationships with approximately 800 of these firms and continue to develop new relationships with additional firms. With our track record of successful partnership, we are uniquely positioned to execute on a diverse opportunity set, including a broad array of traditional, alternative and wealth management firms. We believe that demographic trends will continue to create a number of succession planning opportunities as the founders of independent firms recognize the need for partnership transition, or otherwise seek a degree of financial diversification and access to the resources and scale of a global asset management company to pursue their growth strategy. In addition, we believe alternative firms will continue to seek institutional partnerships and liquidity, thereby creating a number of opportunities for minority investments. Finally, we expect that transaction opportunities will continue to include the potential for investments resulting from subsidiary divestitures, secondary sales and other special situations.We are well positioned to execute upon these investment opportunities through our established process of identifying and cultivating investment prospects, our broad industry relationships, and our substantial experience and expertise in structuring and negotiating transactions. We have a strong reputation as an outstanding partner to our existing Affiliates, and are widely recognized in the marketplace as providing an innovative solution for the succession needs of the highest quality boutique investment management firms in the world.CompetitionIn each of our three principal distribution channels, we and our Affiliates compete with a large number of other domestic and foreign investment management firms, as well as subsidiaries of larger financial organizations. These firms may have significantly greater financial, technological and marketing resources, captive distribution and assets under management and many offer an even broader array of investment products and services. Since certain Affiliates are active in the same distribution channels, from time to time they compete with each other for clients. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry for new investment management firms to compete with our Affiliates, especially in the Institutional distribution channel. We believe that the most important factors affecting our ability to compete for clients in our three principal distribution channels are the:•performance records, investment style, discipline and reputation of our Affiliates and their management teams;•ability to attract and retain high quality investment professionals;•depth and continuity of client relationships;•diversity of products offered;•level of client service offered;•continued success of our global distribution platform and the strong business relationships with the major intermediaries who currently distribute our products; and•development and marketing of new investment strategies to meet the changing needs of investors.The relative importance of each of these factors can vary depending on the distribution channel and the type of investment management service involved, as well as general market conditions. Each Affiliate's ability to retain and increase assets under management would be adversely affected if client accounts underperform in comparison to relevant benchmarks or peer groups, or if key personnel leave the Affiliate. The ability of each Affiliate to compete with other investment management firms also depends, in part, on the relative attractiveness of its investment philosophies and methods under then-prevailing market trends.We compete with a number of acquirers of investment management firms, including other investment management companies, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and larger financial organizations. We believe that important factors affecting our ability to compete for future investments are the:4Table of Contents•degree to which target firms view our investment model, equity incentive structures and economies of scale as preferable, financially, operationally or otherwise, to acquisition or investment arrangements offered by other potential purchasers; and•reputation and performance of our existing and future Affiliates, by which target firms may judge us and our future prospects.Government Regulation Our business is subject to complex and extensive regulation by various regulatory authorities in jurisdictions around the world. This regulatory environment may be altered without notice by new laws or regulations, revisions to existing laws or regulations or new or revised interpretations or guidance. Global financial regulatory reform initiatives are likely to result in more stringent regulation, and changes in laws or regulations and their application to us (including under the new risk regime established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) could have a material adverse impact on our business, our financial results and mode of operations, and could require that we or our Affiliates incur substantial cost or curtail our operations or investment offerings. Regulatory authorities may also conduct examinations or inspections of our operations or those of our Affiliates and any determination of a failure to comply with laws or regulations could result in disciplinary or enforcement action with penalties that may include the disgorgement of fees, fines, suspensions or censure of individual employees or revocation or limitation of business activities or registration. Even in the absence of wrongdoing, regulatory inquiries or proceedings could cause substantial expenditures of time and capital and result in reputational damage, and potentially have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Our U.S. retail distribution platform is comprised of two advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act), and they collectively sponsor over 70 U.S. mutual funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act) that are managed by Affiliates and unrelated investment managers. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements and compliance and disclosure obligations. The Investment Company Act imposes additional obligations on fund advisers, including governance, compliance, reporting and fiduciary obligations relating to the management of mutual funds. Outside of the U.S., Affiliated Managers Group Limited is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and its branch, AMG Limited (Dubai), is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority. Affiliated Managers Group (Hong Kong) Limited is regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, and Affiliated Managers Group Pty Ltd is regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia. We and our Affiliates may be subject to regulatory capital requirements, including those of federal, state and non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Our and our Affiliates’ regulatory capital, as defined, meets or exceeds all minimum requirements.Our Affiliates’ investment management operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. authorities. The majority of our Affiliates are registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act, and many of our Affiliates are also subject to non-U.S. regulatory oversight. We have Affiliates domiciled in a number of jurisdictions and these Affiliates are subject to extensive regulation under the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Our Affiliates also offer their products and services in many countries around the world, and are subject to various requirements relating to such activities. Many of our Affiliates also sponsor registered and unregistered funds in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, including Guernsey, Ireland, Luxembourg, British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, and are subject to regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions and in the jurisdictions where those funds may be offered. Our Affiliates invest in publicly traded securities of issuers across the globe and are subject to requirements in numerous jurisdictions for reporting of beneficial ownership positions and other requirements. Virtually all aspects of the asset management business, including related sales and distribution activities, are subject to regulation. These laws, rules and regulations are primarily intended to protect the clients of asset managers, and generally grant supervisory agencies and regulatory bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting its business in the event of a failure to comply with such laws and regulations, to suspend registered employees and to invoke censures or fines for both the regulated business and its employees.We and our Affiliates are also subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and related regulations, with respect to their retirement plan clients. ERISA imposes duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, and prohibits certain transactions involving related parties to a retirement plan. The Department of Labor administers ERISA and regulates investment advisers who service retirement plan clients. We and certain of our Affiliates are also regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with respect to the management of mutual funds and other products that utilize futures, swaps or other derivative products. 5Table of ContentsIn addition, we and certain of our Affiliates are registered broker-dealers and members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), for the purpose of distributing funds or other asset management products. These broker-dealers are subject to net capital rules that mandate that they maintain certain levels of capital. FINRA has adopted extensive regulatory requirements relating to sales practices, compliance and supervision, compensation and disclosure, and conducts periodic examinations of member broker-dealers. The SEC, FINRA and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or registered employees. These administrative proceedings, whether or not resulting in adverse findings, can require substantial expenditures and can have an adverse impact on the reputation or business of a broker-dealer. Due to the extensive laws and regulations to which we and our Affiliates are subject, we must devote substantial time, expense and effort to remaining current on, and addressing, legal and regulatory compliance matters. We have an experienced team of legal and compliance professionals in place to address the legal, regulatory and compliance requirements relating to our global operations, and have in place relationships with various legal and regulatory advisors in each of the countries where we have business interests. Each of our Affiliates has established a compliance program to address compliance requirements for its operations, and provides ongoing reporting to us on compliance matters. Employees and Corporate OrganizationAs of December 31, 2014, we and our Affiliates had approximately 2,900 employees, the substantial majority of which were full-time. Neither we nor any of our Affiliates is subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and we believe that our labor relations are good. We were formed in 1993 as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware.Our Web SiteOur web site is www.amg.com.

We make these reports available through our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after our electronic filing of such materials with, or the furnishing of them to, the SEC. The information contained or incorporated on our web site is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.6Table of ContentsItem 1A.Risk FactorsWe face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our business, including market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal and regulatory risks. The following are some of the more important factors that could affect our business. Certain statements in “Risk Factors” are forward-looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”Our financial results depend on investment management fees received by our Affiliates, which are impacted by market returns and investment performance.Investment management fees are typically based on the market value of assets under management, and fees will be adversely affected by declines in the capital markets and in the equity markets in particular. Some of our Affiliates are paid fees based on investment performance on an absolute basis or relative to a benchmark and, as such, are directly dependent upon investment results which may vary substantially from year to year. Unfavorable market performance and volatility in the capital markets or in the prices of specific securities may impact the ability to market Affiliate products and services and reduce our Affiliates' assets under management, which in turn may adversely affect the fees payable to our Affiliates and, ultimately, our results of operations and financial condition. These factors may also impact our ability to market the products and services available through our U.S. retail distribution platform, which in turn may adversely affect the fees payable to us and impact our financial results. Additionally, global economic conditions, exacerbated by changes in the equity or debt marketplaces, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, the yield curve, financial crises, war, terrorism, natural disasters or other factors that are difficult to predict affect equity markets and levels of our assets under management. Because our assets under management are largely concentrated in equity products, our financial results are particularly susceptible to downturns in the equity markets, or a decline in the assets invested in the equity markets.Our growth strategy depends upon continued growth from our existing Affiliates and upon making new investments in boutique investment management firms.Our Affiliates may not maintain their respective levels of performance or contribute to our growth at their historical or currently anticipated levels. Also, our Affiliates may be unable to carry out their management succession plans, which may adversely affect their operations and revenue streams and thus our results of operations.The continued success of our investment program will depend upon our ability to find suitable firms in which to invest, our ability to negotiate agreements with such firms on acceptable terms, and our ability to raise the capital necessary to finance such transactions. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in investing in such firms or that they will have favorable operating results following our investment, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our financial results would be adversely affected by any reduction in our assets under management, and may be impacted by changes in the relative levels of assets under management among our Affiliates.Investment management fees are primarily based on a percentage of the value of assets under management, and vary with the nature of the account or product managed. Any decrease in the level of our assets under management generally, as a result of either a decline in market value of such assets or net outflows, would reduce our revenue and profitability. Our Affiliates represent a diverse group of boutique investment management firms with predominantly actively managed products, and changes in investor risk tolerance or investment preferences could result in investor allocation away from products managed by our Affiliates or adversely impact their ability to maintain existing advisory relationships and fee structures. Additionally, our contractual revenue sharing arrangements with our Affiliates are tailored to meet the needs of each Affiliate and are therefore varied, and our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected by changes in the relative performance and the relative levels of assets under management among our Affiliates, independent of overall effective fee rates and our total level of assets under management. Fluctuations in the amount and mix of our assets under management may be attributable in part to market conditions outside of our control. Any decrease in the level of our assets under management or adverse changes in the mix among our Affiliates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Historically, equity markets and our common stock have been volatile.The market price of our common stock historically has experienced and may continue to experience volatility, and the broader equity markets have experienced and may again experience significant price and volume fluctuations. In addition, our announcements of our quarterly operating results, including changes in net client cash flows and aggregate assets under management, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us, our Affiliates or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.If our reputation is harmed, we could suffer losses in our business and financial results.7Table of ContentsOur business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our Affiliates and our stockholders. Our reputation is critical to our business and is vulnerable to threats that may be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. For example, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, errors in our public reports or litigation, or the publicity surrounding these events, even if satisfactorily addressed, could adversely impact our reputation, our relationships with our Affiliates and our ability to negotiate agreements with boutique investment management firms, as well as negatively impact our financial results.  Our business is highly regulated.Our business is subject to extensive regulation by various regulatory and self-regulatory authorities in jurisdictions around the world, as detailed in “Government Regulation” in Item 1. These laws and regulations impose requirements, restrictions and limitations on our and our Affiliates' businesses and compliance with these laws and regulations results in significant cost and expense. If we or any of our Affiliates were to fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations or be named as a subject of an investigation or other regulatory action, the public announcement and potential publicity surrounding any such investigation or action could have a material adverse effect on our stock price and result in increased costs even if we (or our Affiliates) were found not to have violated such laws, rules or regulations. Our failure or the failure of any Affiliate to satisfy regulatory requirements could subject us to civil liability, criminal liability or sanctions that might materially impact our or our Affiliate's business. As investment advisers, our Affiliates are subject to numerous obligations, fiduciary duties and other regulatory requirements, where non-compliance could result in censure or termination of adviser status, litigation or reputational harm, any of which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and results of operations.  Proposals in the U.S. and the European Union have called for more stringent regulation of the financial services industry in which we and our Affiliates operate, which may make it more likely that changes will occur that could adversely affect our business, our access to capital and the market for our common stock.Changes in laws or regulatory requirements, or the interpretation or application of such laws and regulatory requirements by regulatory authorities, can occur without notice and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and mode of operations. In the U.S., regulatory uncertainty continues to surround the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which represented a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services regulatory environment and requires federal agencies to implement numerous new rules, which may impose additional restrictions and limitations on our and our Affiliates' businesses as they are adopted. In the United Kingdom and Europe, our business may be impacted by financial services reform initiatives enacted or under consideration in the European Union. Compliance with these new laws and regulations may also result in increased compliance costs and expenses, and non-compliance may result in fines and penalties.Our international operations are subject to foreign risks, including political, regulatory, economic and currency risks.We and some of our Affiliates operate offices or advise clients outside of the U.S., and several Affiliates are based outside the U.S. Accordingly, we and our Affiliates that have non-U.S. operations are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, in addition to the risks our business faces more generally. These risks may include changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, longer payment cycles, difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable, different, and in some cases, less stringent legal, regulatory and accounting regimes, political instability, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, expatriation controls, expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences. In addition, we and certain of our Affiliates are required to maintain minimum levels of capital and such capital requirements may be increased from time-to-time, which may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of distributions to us by these Affiliates. These or other risks related to our non-U.S. operations may have an adverse effect both on our Affiliates and on our consolidated business, financial condition and results of operations.Failure to comply with the applicable laws, rules, regulations, codes, directives, notices or guidelines in any jurisdiction outside of the U.S. could result in a wide range of penalties and disciplinary actions, including fines, censures and the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and operations. Regulators in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. could also change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to offer our investment products and services in their respective markets, or we may be unable to keep up with, or adapt to, the ever changing, complex regulatory requirements in such jurisdictions or markets, which could further negatively impact our business.Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and are subject to ongoing tax audits in such jurisdictions and may be subject to future tax audits. We regularly assess the 8Table of Contentslikely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and/or penalties and interest. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our financial condition. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, proposals in the U.S. and the European Union have called for additional taxation of the financial services industry and proposals for fundamental U.S. corporate tax reform, if enacted, could change the amount of taxes we are required to pay and have a significant impact on our future results of operations and financial condition.Our Affiliates' autonomy limits our ability to alter their management practices and policies, and we may be held responsible for liabilities incurred by certain of them.Although our agreements with our Affiliates typically give us the authority to control and/or vote with respect to certain of their business activities, we generally are not directly involved in managing our Affiliates' day-to-day activities, including investment management policies and procedures, fee levels, marketing and product development, client relationships, employment and compensation programs and compliance activities. As a consequence, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by problems stemming from the day-to-day operations of our Affiliates, where weaknesses or failures in internal processes or systems could lead to a disruption of our Affiliates' operations, liability to their clients, exposure to disciplinary action or reputational harm.Some of our Affiliates are partnerships or limited liability companies of which we, or entities controlled by us, are the general partner or managing member. Consequently, to the extent that any of these majority-owned Affiliates incur liabilities or expenses that exceed their ability to pay for them, we may be directly or indirectly liable for their payment. Similarly, an Affiliate’s payment of distributions to us may be subject to claims by potential creditors, and an Affiliate may default on distributions that are payable to us. In addition, with respect to each of these Affiliates, we may be held liable in some circumstances as a control person for the acts of the Affiliate or its employees. While we and our Affiliates maintain errors and omissions and general liability insurance in amounts believed to be adequate to cover certain potential liabilities, we cannot be certain that we will not have claims that exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, that the insurers will remain solvent and will meet their obligations to provide coverage or that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us and our Affiliates with sufficient limits and at a reasonable cost. A judgment in excess of available insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.The agreed-upon expense allocation under our revenue sharing arrangements with our Affiliates may not be large enough to pay for all of the respective Affiliate's operating expenses.Our Affiliates have generally entered into agreements with us under which they have agreed to pay us a specified percentage of their respective revenue, while retaining a percentage of revenue for use in paying that Affiliate's operating expenses. We may not anticipate and reflect in those agreements possible changes in the revenue and expense base of any Affiliate, and the agreed-upon expense allocation may not be large enough to pay for all of an Affiliate's operating expenses. We may elect to defer the receipt of our share of an Affiliate's revenue to permit the Affiliate to fund such operating expenses, or we may restructure our relationship with an Affiliate with the aim of maximizing the long-term benefits to us, but we cannot be certain that any such deferral or restructured relationship would be of any greater benefit to us. Such a deferral or restructured relationship may have an adverse effect on our near-term or long-term results of operations and financial condition.At our profit-based Affiliates, we have direct exposure to fluctuations in operating expenses relative to revenues. We typically structure our Affiliate investments as revenue sharing arrangements, where a percentage of revenue is allocable to fund operating expenses and the remaining revenue is allocable to us and Affiliate management, with our share generally receiving priority. However, at our profit-based Affiliates, we receive a share of profits as cash flow, rather than a percentage of revenue. As a result, we participate directly in any increase or decrease in the revenue or operating expenses of such firms and our share of profits typically does not receive priority over Affiliate management or expenses. This structure allows us to benefit from any margin expansion at these Affiliates, but also exposes us directly to any margin contraction, which we may not anticipate and which could be significant.Our industry is highly competitive.Through our Affiliates, we compete with a broad range of domestic and foreign investment management firms, including public and private investment advisors, firms associated with securities broker-dealers, financial institutions, insurance companies, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and other entities that serve our three principal distribution channels, many of whom have greater resources. This competition may reduce the fees that our Affiliates can obtain for their services. We believe that our Affiliates' ability to compete effectively with other firms in our three distribution channels depends upon our Affiliates' products, investment performance, reputations, and client-servicing capabilities, and the marketing and distribution 9Table of Contentsof their investment products, among other factors. See "Competition" in Item 1. Our Affiliates may not compare favorably with their competitors in any or all of these categories. From time to time, our Affiliates also compete with each other for clients.The market for acquisitions of interests in boutique investment management firms is highly competitive. Many other public and private financial services companies, including commercial and investment banks, private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and investment management firms, which may have significantly greater resources than we do, also invest in or buy boutique investment management firms. Further, we utilize a structure with our Affiliates that is designed to provide appropriate incentives for management owners while enabling us to protect our interests, including through revenue sharing arrangements and through long-term employment agreements with key members of the firm. Target investment management firms may prefer investments in their firms under terms and structures offered by our competitors. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively with such companies, that new competitors will not enter the market or that such competition will not make it more difficult or not feasible for us to make new investments in boutique investment management firms.The failure to consummate announced investments in new boutique investment management firms could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.Consummation of our acquisition transactions is generally subject to a number of closing conditions, contingencies and approvals, including but not limited to obtaining certain consents of the boutique investment management firms' clients. In the event that an announced transaction is not consummated, we may experience a decline in the price of our common stock to the extent that the then-current market price reflects a market assumption that we will complete the announced transaction. In addition, the fact that a transaction did not close after we announced it publicly may negatively affect our ability and prospects to consummate transactions in the future. Finally, we must pay costs related to these transactions, including legal and accounting fees, even if the transactions are not completed, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We expect that we will need to raise additional capital in the future, and existing or future resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms.While we believe that our existing cash resources and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for normal operations for the foreseeable future, our continuing acquisitions of interests in new and existing Affiliate boutique investment management firms may require additional capital. In addition, we are contingently liable to make additional purchase payments (of up to $276.0 million through 2017) upon the achievement of specified financial targets in connection with certain of our prior acquisitions. As of December 31, 2014, we expected to make payments of $75.0 million ($17.5 million in 2015) to settle obligations related to consolidated Affiliates and may make payments of up to $201.0 million related to the Company's equity method investments. Subject to certain limitations, Affiliate partners have the conditional right to put equity interests to us over time. Because these obligations are conditional and dependent upon the individual equity-holder’s decision to sell their equity, it is difficult to predict the frequency and magnitude of these repurchases (our Redeemable non-controlling interests balance at December 31, 2014 was $645.5 million). These obligations may require more cash than is then available from operations. Thus, we may need to raise capital by making additional borrowings or by selling shares of our common stock or other equity or debt securities, or to otherwise refinance a portion of these obligations.As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding total debt of $1.9 billion. Our level of indebtedness may increase if we fund one or more future acquisitions through borrowings under our credit facility. This additional indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and will require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness.The financing activities described above could increase our interest expense, decrease our Net income (controlling interest) or dilute the interests of our existing stockholders. In addition, our access to further capital, and the cost of capital we are able to access, is influenced by our credit rating. We have received credit ratings of A3 and BBB+ from Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, respectively. The rating agencies could decide to downgrade our ratings or the entire investment management industry, thereby making it difficult to access capital markets. In addition, a reduction in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs.Our credit facility imposes certain financial and other covenants relating to the conduct of our business and, if amounts borrowed under it were subject to accelerated repayment, we may not have sufficient assets or liquidity to repay such amounts in full.Our credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios, including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Our credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, place certain limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt, merge or transfer assets and on 10Table of Contentsour ability to create liens. The breach of any covenant (either due to our actions or due to a significant and prolonged market-driven decline in our operating results) could result in a default under the credit facility. In the event of any such default, lenders that are party to the credit facility could refuse to make further extensions of credit to us and require all amounts borrowed under the credit facility, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If any indebtedness under the credit facility were subject to accelerated repayment, we might not have sufficient liquid assets to repay such indebtedness in full.We have substantial intangibles on our balance sheet, and any impairment of our intangibles could adversely affect our results of operations.At December 31, 2014, our total assets were $7.7 billion, of which $4.4 billion were intangible assets, and $1.8 billion were Equity investments in Affiliates, an amount comprised primarily of intangible assets. We cannot be certain that we will ever realize the value of such intangible assets. An impairment of our intangible assets or an other than temporary decline in the value of our equity investments could adversely affect our results of operations.We and our Affiliates rely on certain key personnel and cannot guarantee their continued service.We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and our other officers and employees. Our executive officers, in particular, play an important role in the stability and growth of our existing Affiliates and in identifying potential investment opportunities for us. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers, although each has a significant equity interest in the Company and is subject to non-solicitation and non-competitive restrictions that may be triggered upon their departure. However, there is no guarantee that these officers will remain with the Company.In addition, our Affiliates depend heavily on the services of key principals, who in many cases have managed their firms for many years. These principals often are primarily responsible for their firm's investment decisions. Although we use a combination of economic incentives, transfer restrictions and, in some instances, non-solicitation agreements and employment agreements in an effort to retain key management personnel, there is no guarantee that these principals will remain with their firms. Since certain Affiliates contribute significantly to our revenue, the loss of key management personnel at these Affiliates could have a disproportionate adverse impact on our business.Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate, and operational risk could adversely affect our reputation and financial position.We have adopted various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk in our business. While we currently believe that our operational controls are effective, we cannot provide assurance that those controls, procedures, policies and systems will always be adequate to identify and manage the internal and external risks in our various businesses. Furthermore, we may have errors in our business processes or fail to implement proper procedures in our operating businesses, which may expose us to risk of financial loss or failure to comply with a regulatory requirement. We are also subject to the risk that our employees or contractors, the employees or contractors of our Affiliates, or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud or act in ways that are inconsistent with our and our Affiliates’ controls, policies and procedures. The financial and reputational impact of control failures can be significant.In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, regulatory requirements, our and our Affiliates’ businesses, counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations.Provisions in our organizational documents, Delaware law and our debt agreements could delay or prevent a change in control of our company.Provisions in our charter and by-laws and anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control in the Company. These provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to replace our current management without the consent of our Board of Directors. Provisions in our charter and by-laws that could delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control include:•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the terms, rights and preferences of the preferred stock without stockholder approval; and•the prohibition on the right of stockholders to call meetings or act by written consent and limitations on the right of stockholders to present proposals or make nominations at stockholder meetings.11Table of ContentsDelaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our credit facility, the term loan and the indentures governing our senior notes contain various covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Further, given our partnership approach, which is designed to preserve our Affiliates' operational autonomy and independence, a change in control may also be viewed negatively by our Affiliates, impacting their relationship with us. These anti-takeover provisions and other factors may inhibit a change of control in circumstances that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the market price in our common stock, and may result in negative impacts on our financial results in periods following a change of control.The sale or issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact the price of our common stock.The sale or issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely impact its price. In connection with our financing activities, we have issued securities and entered into contracts including our junior convertible trust preferred securities and forward equity agreements that may result in the issuance of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events. We also have exercisable options outstanding and unvested restricted stock that have been awarded under our share-based incentive plans. Moreover, in connection with future financing activities, we may issue additional convertible securities or shares of our common stock. Any such issuance of shares of our common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current equity holders. In the event that a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the public market, the price of our common stock may fall.Failure to maintain and properly safeguard an adequate technology infrastructure may limit our growth, result in losses or disrupt our business.Our and our Affiliates' businesses are reliant upon our financial, accounting and technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store information, including sensitive client and proprietary information, and to conduct many business activities and transactions with clients, advisors, vendors and other third parties. The failure to implement, maintain and safeguard an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our business could impede our productivity and growth, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we rely on third parties for certain aspects of our business, including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers, and these parties are also susceptible to similar risks.Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software, networks and mobile devices, and those of third parties on whom we rely, may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, breaches, unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. If any such events occur, it could jeopardize our or our Affiliates', as well as our or their clients', employees', or counterparties' confidential, proprietary and other sensitive information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our or third party computer systems, networks and mobile devices, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our Affiliates', as well as our or their clients', employees' or counterparties' operations. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and networks, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all threats, especially because the techniques used change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources. As a result, we could experience disruption of our business, significant losses, increased costs, reputational harm, regulatory actions or legal liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to spend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against fully or not fully covered through any insurance that we maintain.Our financial results could be adversely affected by the financial stability of other financial institutions.We and our Affiliates routinely execute transactions with various counterparties in the financial services industry. Historical market volatility highlights the interconnection of the global markets and demonstrates how the deteriorating financial condition of one institution may materially and adversely impact the performance of other institutions. We and our Affiliates may be exposed to credit, operational or other risk in the event that a counterparty with whom we transact defaults on its obligations, or if there are other unrelated systemic failures in the markets.Our Affiliates' investment management contracts are subject to termination on short notice.Our Affiliates derive almost all of their revenue from their clients based upon their investment management contracts with those clients. These contracts are typically terminable by the client without penalty upon relatively short notice (typically not longer than 60 days) and may not be assignable without consent. We cannot be certain that our Affiliates will be able to retain 12Table of Contentstheir existing clients or attract new clients. If our Affiliates' clients withdraw a substantial amount of funds, it is likely to harm our results. In addition, investment management contracts with mutual funds are subject to annual approval by each fund's board of directors.13Table of ContentsItem 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments
