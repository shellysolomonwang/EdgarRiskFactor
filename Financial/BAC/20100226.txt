Item 1A. Risk Factors   In the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks that are inherent to the financial services industry. The following discusses some of the key inherent risk factors that could affect our business and operations, as well as other risk factors which are particularly relevant to us in the current period of significant economic and market disruption. Other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this report could also adversely affect our business and operations, and these risk factors should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that may affect us.  Our businesses and earnings have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected by adverse business and economic conditions. Our businesses and earnings are affected by general business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. Given the concentration of our business activities in the United States, we are particularly exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy. For example, as a result of the challenging economic environment there continues to be a greater likelihood that an elevated number of our customers or counterparties will become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to us, which, in turn, may continue to result in a high level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, all of which would adversely affect our earnings and capital levels.  General business and economic conditions that could affect us include the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of credit, investor confidence, and the strength of the U.S. economy and the other economies in which we operate. The deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses and securities portfolios, as well as our earnings.  In 2009, weak economic conditions in the United States and abroad continued to adversely affect many of our businesses as well as our earnings. Dramatic declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures, and rising unemployment and underemployment, have further negatively impacted the demand for many of our products and the credit performance of our consumer and commercial portfolios. In addition, these conditions resulted in significant write-downs of asset values in several asset classes, notably mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate and leveraged loans and exposure to monoline insurers. While there are early indications that the U.S. economy is stabilizing, the performance of our overall consumer and commercial portfolios may not significantly improve in the near future. A protracted continuation or worsening of these difficult business or economic conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects on us.  We have sold and continue to sell mortgage and other loans, including mortgage loans to third-party buyers and to the Federal National Mortgage    Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the process for selecting the loans for inclusion in a sale and compliance with applicable criteria established by the buyer. We also have indirect exposure with respect to our mortgage and other loan sales as a result of credit protection provided by monoline financial guarantors. We have experienced and continue to experience increasing repurchase demands from and disputes with these buyers and monoline financial guarantors. In the event we are required to repurchase these mortgage and other loans or provide indemnification or other recourse, this could significantly increase our losses and thereby affect our future earnings.  Additional factors which could reduce our earnings include, among other things, lower residual net interest income as a result of a decision to deleverage our asset and liability management portfolio, higher than expected losses on our purchased impaired portfolio and compliance with governmental foreclosure prevention and loan modification initiatives.  We are a diversified financial services company providing consumer and commercial banking, credit card, mortgage, investment banking and capital markets trading services and investment services. Although we believe this diversity generally assists us in lessening the effect of a downturn in any of our businesses, it also means that our earnings could be adversely affected by the downturn to the extent not fully offset by any of our other businesses.  For a further discussion of the economic downturn and the resulting adverse impact on our credit performance, see “Executive Summary,” “Financial Highlights” and “Credit Risk Management” in the MD&A.  Our increased credit risk could result in higher credit losses and reduced earnings. When we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their agreements. A number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale. As one of the nation’s largest lenders, the credit quality of our consumer and commercial portfolios has a significant impact on our earnings. Current negative economic conditions are likely to continue to increase our credit exposure to third parties who may be more likely to default on their obligations to us. This increased credit risk could adversely affect our consumer credit card, home equity, consumer real estate and purchased impaired portfolios, among others, including causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which we expect will continue to impact our charge-offs and provision for credit losses. In addition, this could also adversely affect our commercial loan portfolios where we have experienced increased losses, particularly in our commercial real estate and commercial domestic portfolios, reflecting broad based deteriorations across industries, property types and borrowers.  We estimate and establish reserves for credit risks and credit losses inherent in our lending activities (including unfunded lending commitments), excluding those measured at fair value under the fair value option. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how our borrowers will react to those conditions. Our ability to assess future economic conditions or the creditworthiness of our customers is imperfect. The ability of our borrowers to repay their loans will likely be impacted by changes in economic conditions, which in turn could impact the accuracy of our forecasts. As with any such assessments, there is also the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors that we identify. In addition, we may underestimate the credit losses in our loan portfolios and suffer unexpected losses if the models and approaches we use to establish reserves and make judgments in extending credit to our bor -          Bank of America 2009   5   Table of Contents     rowers and other counterparties become less predictive of future behaviors, valuations, assumptions or estimates.  In the ordinary course of our business, we also may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular industry, country, counterparty, borrower or issuer. A deterioration in the financial condition or prospects of a particular industry or a failure or downgrade of, or default by, any particular entity or group of entities could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries and countries may not function as we have anticipated. While our activities expose us to many different industries and counterparties, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment funds and insurers. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry.  We have concentration of credit risk with respect to our consumer real estate, consumer credit card and commercial real estate portfolios, which represent a large percentage of our overall credit portfolio. The current financial crisis and economic slowdown has adversely affected these portfolios and further exposed us to this concentration of risk. Continued economic weakness or deterioration in real estate values or household incomes could result in materially higher credit losses.  For a further discussion of credit risk and our credit risk management policies and procedures, see “Credit Risk Management” in the MD&A and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Adverse changes in legislative and regulatory initiatives may significantly impact our earnings, operations, capital position and ability to pursue business opportunities. We are heavily regulated by regulatory agencies at the federal, state and international levels. As a result of the recent financial crisis and economic downturn, we have faced and expect to continue to face increased regulation and regulatory and political scrutiny, which creates significant uncertainty for us and the financial services industry in general.  In 2009, several major regulatory and legislative initiatives were adopted that will have significant future impacts on our businesses and financial results. For instance, in November 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued amendments to Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. The new rules have a compliance date of July 1, 2010. These amendments change, among other things, the way we and other banks may charge overdraft fees by limiting our ability to charge an overdraft fee for automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer’s account, unless the consumer affirmatively consents to payment of overdrafts for those transactions. In connection with the amendments, we announced a program that allowed customers to opt out of overdraft services prior to the effective date of the amendments. In addition, in May 2009, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 was enacted that provides for comprehensive reform related to credit card industry practices, including (1) significantly restricting banks’ ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, (2) changing the way payments are applied and (3) requiring changes to consumer credit card disclosures. As a result, as we announced in October 2009, we did not increase interest rates on consumer credit accounts in response to provisions in the CARD Act prior to its effective date, unless a customer’s account fell past due or was based on a variable interest rate. The most significant provisions of the CARD Act took effect in February 2010. Complying with the Regulation E amendments and the CARD Act requires us to invest significant management attention and resources to make the necessary disclosure and systems changes and will likely adversely affect our earnings.  Federal banking regulatory agencies may from time to time require that we change our required capital levels, including maintaining capital above    minimum levels. In January 2010, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule regarding risk-based capital that eliminates the exclusion of certain asset- backed commercial paper (ABCP) program assets from risk-weighted assets. As a result of the new rules, as with all other consolidated variable interest entities, a banking organization is required to include the assets of a consolidated ABCP program in risk-weighted assets. The new rules would also eliminate the associated provision in the general risk-based capital rules that excludes from Tier 1 capital the noncontrolling interest in a consolidated ABCP program not included in a banking organization’s risk-weighted assets. Beginning with reporting for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, we will be required to risk-weight the underlying assets of ABCP conduits as well as the contractual exposures (e.g. liquidity facilities).  In conjunction with the federal banking regulatory agencies’ Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) conducted in May 2009, we were required to increase Tier 1 common capital by approximately $33.9 billion. Additionally, in order to repay the $45 billion investment in our preferred stock previously made under the Trouble Asset Relief Program (TARP) by the U.S. Treasury, in December 2009, we raised approximately $19.3 billion in gross proceeds in an offering of CES and agreed to increase equity by $3 billion through asset sales by June 30, 2010 and raise up to approximately $1.7 billion through the issuance of restricted stock in lieu of a portion of incentive cash compensation to certain Bank of America associates as part of normal year-end incentive payments. For a further discussion of the CES, see “Executive Summary—TARP Repayment” in the MD&A.  In July 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a consultative document that would significantly increase the capital requirements for trading book activities if adopted as proposed. The proposal recommended implementation by December 31, 2010, but regulatory agencies are currently evaluating the proposed rulemaking and related impacts before establishing final rules. As a result, we cannot determine the implementation date or the final capital impact.  In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released consultative documents on both capital and liquidity. If adopted as proposed, this could increase significantly the aggregate equity that bank holding companies are required to hold, by disqualifying certain instruments that previously have qualified as Tier 1 capital. The proposal currently includes a leverage ratio and increased liquidity and disclosure requirements. The leverage ratio could prove more restrictive than a risk-based measure while the liquidity requirement could result in banks holding greater levels of lower yielding instruments as a percentage of their assets. The proposal could also increase the capital charges imposed on certain assets, potentially making certain businesses more expensive to conduct. U.S. regulatory agencies have not opined on these proposals for U.S. implementation. We continue to assess the potential impact of this proposal. If we are required to increase our regulatory capital as a result of these or other regulatory or legislative initiatives, we may be required among other things to issue additional shares of common stock, which could dilute our existing stockholders.  As a result of the financial crisis, the financial services industry is facing the possibility of legislative and regulatory changes that would impose significant, adverse changes on its ability to serve both retail and wholesale customers. A proposal is currently being considered to levy a tax or fee on financial institutions with assets in excess of $50 billion to repay the costs of TARP, although the proposed tax would continue even after those costs are repaid. If enacted as proposed, the tax could significantly affect our earnings, either by increasing the costs of our liabilities or causing us to reduce our assets. It remains uncertain whether the tax will be enacted, to whom it would apply, or the amount of the tax we would be required to pay. It is also unclear the extent to which the costs of such a tax could be recouped through higher pricing.  In addition, various proposals for broad-based reform of the financial regulatory system are pending. A majority of these proposals would not           6   Bank of America 2009   Table of Contents     disrupt our core businesses, but a proposal could ultimately be adopted that adversely affects certain of our businesses. The proposals would require divestment of certain proprietary trading activities, or limit private equity investments. Other proposals, which include limiting the scope of an institution’s derivatives activities, or forcing certain derivatives activities to be traded on exchanges, would diminish the demand for, and profitability of, certain businesses. Several other proposals would require issuers to retain unhedged interests in any asset that is securitized, potentially severely restricting the secondary market as a source of funding for consumer or commercial lending. There are also numerous proposals pending on how to resolve a failed systemically important institution. Following the passage of a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives and the possibility of similar provisions in a U.S. Senate bill, one ratings agency has placed us and other banks on negative outlook, and therefore adoption of such provisions may adversely affect our access to credit markets.  In addition, other countries, including the United Kingdom and France, have proposed and in some cases adopted certain reforms targeted at financial institutions, including, but not limited to, increased capital and liquidity requirements for local entities, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of foreign bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well as branches of foreign banks located in the United Kingdom, the creation and production of recovery and resolutions plans (commonly referred to as living wills) by such entities, and a significant payroll tax on bank bonuses paid to employees over a certain threshold.  There can be no assurance as to whether or when any of the parts of these or other proposals will be enacted, and if enacted, what the final initiatives will consist of and what the ultimate impact on us will be.  We also may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the DIF and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits, which could increase our noninterest expense and reduce our earnings.  For more information on these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives, see “Regulatory Initiatives” in the MD&A.  In addition, Congress is currently considering reinstating income tax provisions whereby a majority of the income of certain foreign subsidiaries would not be subject to current U.S. income tax as a result of long-standing deferral provisions applicable to active finance income. These provisions, which in the past have expired and been extended, expired again for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010. Absent an extension of these provisions, active financing income earned by our foreign subsidiaries during 2010 will generally be subject to a tax provision that considers the incremental U.S. income tax. The impact of the expiration of the provisions should they not be extended could be significant. The exact impact would depend upon the amount, composition and geographic mix of our future earnings. For more information on these provisions, see “Financial Highlights—Income Tax Expense” in the MD&A.  Compliance with current or future legislative and regulatory initiatives could require us to change certain of our business practices, impose significant additional costs on us, limit the products that we offer, result in a significant loss of revenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require us to increase our regulatory capital, cause business disruptions, impact the value of assets that we hold or otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. We have recently witnessed the introduction of an ever-increasing number of regulatory proposals that could substantially impact us and others in the financial services industry. The extent of changes imposed by, and frequency of adoption of, any regulatory initiatives could make it more difficult for us to comply in a timely manner, which could further limit our operations, increase compliance costs or divert management attention or other resources. The long-term impact of legislative and    regulatory initiatives on our business practices and revenues will depend upon the successful implementation of our strategies, consumer behavior, and competitors’ responses to such initiatives, all of which are difficult to predict.  We could suffer losses as a result of the actions of or deterioration in the commercial soundness of other financial services institutions and counterparties, including as a result of derivatives transactions. Our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other market participants. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. Financial services institutions and other counterparties are inter-related because of trading, funding, clearing or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to future losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivatives exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  We are party to a large number of derivatives transactions, including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non-standardized, which can make exiting, transferring or settling some positions difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold, and may not be able to obtain, the underlying security, loan or other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk as well as increased costs to us.  Derivatives contracts and other transactions entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties on a timely basis. While a transaction remains unconfirmed, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of default may find it more difficult to enforce the contract. In addition, as new and more complex derivatives products have been created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts may arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs. For a further discussion of our derivatives exposure, see Note 4 -- Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Changes in accounting standards or inaccurate estimates or assumptions in the application of accounting policies could adversely affect our financial results. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported value of our assets or liabilities and financial results and are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.  Recently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and other regulators have adopted new guidance or rules relating to financial accounting or regulatory capital standards such as, among other things, the rules related to fair value accounting and new FASB guidance on consolidation of variable interest entities. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, the SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered public accounting firm) may amend or even reverse their previous interpretations           Bank of America 2009   7   Table of Contents     or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the Corporation restating prior period financial statements. For a further discussion of some of our critical accounting policies and standards and recent accounting changes, see “Regulatory Initiatives” and “Complex Accounting Estimates” in the MD&A and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is harmed. Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is damaged. Our actual or perceived failure to address various issues could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to us and our business prospects, including failure to properly address operational risks. These issues also include, but are not limited to, legal and regulatory requirements; privacy; properly maintaining customer and associate personal information; record keeping; money-laundering; sales and trading practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products.  We are also facing enhanced public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis, including the U.S. Treasury’s previous investment in our preferred stock, our acquisition of Merrill Lynch, modification of mortgages, volume of lending, compensation practices and the suitability of certain trading and investment businesses. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, reputational harm and legal risks, which could among other consequences increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses.  We face substantial potential legal liability and significant regulatory action, which could have materially adverse financial consequences or cause significant reputational harm to us. We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against us and other financial institutions remain high and are increasing. Increased litigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously impact our business prospects. In addition, we face increased litigation risk and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the Merrill Lynch and Countrywide acquisitions. As a result of current economic conditions and the increased level of defaults over the prior couple of years, we have continued to experience increased litigation and other disputes with counterparties regarding relative rights and responsibilities. These litigation and regulatory matters and any related settlements could adversely impact our earnings and lead to volatility of our stock price. For a further discussion of litigation risks, see Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Our liquidity could be impaired by our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms. Liquidity is essential to our businesses. Under normal business conditions, primary sources of funding for Bank of America Corporation include dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of securities in the capital markets. The primary sources of funding for our banking subsidiaries include customer deposits and wholesale market-based funding. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash, including deposits. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. Our    ability to raise certain types of funds as a result of the recent financial crisis has been and could continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the United States and international markets and economies. In 2009, global capital and credit markets continued to experience volatility and disruptions. As a result, we utilized several temporary U.S. government liquidity programs to enhance our liquidity position. Our ability to engage in securitization funding transactions on favorable terms could be adversely affected by continued or subsequent disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by ratings agencies or deteriorating investor expectations.  Our credit ratings and the credit ratings of our securitization trusts are important to our liquidity. The ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our securities, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt and other securities, including asset securitizations, are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. During 2009, the ratings agencies took numerous actions to adjust our credit ratings and outlooks, many of which were negative. The ratings agencies have indicated that our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government. In February 2010, Standard & Poor’s affirmed our current credit ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable, based on their belief that it is less certain whether the U.S. government would be willing to provide extraordinary support. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position by materially increasing our borrowing costs and significantly limiting our access to the funding or capital markets, including securitizations. A reduction in our credit ratings also could have a significant impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty credit worthiness is critical. In connection with certain trading agreements, we may be required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit ratings downgrade.  For a further discussion of our liquidity position and other liquidity matters, including ratings and outlooks and the policies and procedures we use to manage our liquidity risks, see “Liquidity Risk and Capital Management” in the MD&A.  Changes in financial or capital market conditions could cause our earnings and the value of our assets to decline. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. As a result, we are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions. For example, we rely on bank deposits for a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans that we make. However, changes in interest rates on bank deposits could adversely affect our net interest margin – the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding – which could in turn affect our net interest income and earnings.  Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities and derivatives. Just a few of the market conditions that may change from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include changes in interest and currency exchange rates, equity and futures prices, the implied volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of either the issuer or its country of origin. Accordingly, depending on the instruments or activities impacted, market risks can have wide ranging, complex adverse effects on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. We also may incur significant unrealized gains or losses as a result of changes in our credit spreads or those of third parties, which may affect the fair value of our derivatives instruments and debt securities that we hold or issue.           8   Bank of America 2009   Table of Contents     Our models and strategies we use to assess and control our risk exposures are subject to inherent limitations. For example, our models, which rely on historical trends and assumptions, may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements and illiquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events. The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, such as the market conditions experienced in 2008 and 2009, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. These types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation can be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets. To the extent that we make investments directly in securities that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions.  For a further discussion of market risk and our market risk management policies and procedures, see “Market Risk Management” in the MD&A.  Adverse changes in the value of certain of our assets and liabilities could adversely impact our earnings. We have a large portfolio of financial instruments that we measure at fair value, including among others certain corporate loans and loan commitments, loans held-for-sale, structured reverse repurchase agreements and long-term deposits. We also have trading account assets and liabilities, derivatives assets and liabilities, available-for-sale debt and marketable equity securities, consumer-related mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and certain other assets that are valued at fair value. We determine the fair values of these instruments based on the fair value hierarchy under applicable accounting guidance. The fair values of these financial instruments include adjustments for market liquidity, credit quality and other deal specific factors, where appropriate.  Gains or losses on these instruments can have a direct and significant impact on our earnings, unless we have effectively “hedged” our exposures. For example, changes in interest rates, among other things, can impact the value of our MSRs and can result in substantially higher or lower mortgage banking income and earnings, depending upon our ability to fully hedge the performance of our MSRs. Fair values may be impacted by declining values of the underlying assets or the prices at which observable market transactions occur and the continued availability of these transactions. The financial strength of counterparties, such as monoline financial guarantors, with whom we have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets, also will affect the fair value of these assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets may substantially curtail or eliminate the trading activity for these assets, which may make it very difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may increase our risk-weighted assets which requires us to maintain additional capital and increases our funding costs.  As previously disclosed on a current report on Form 8-K, in connection with the $2.8 billion in cash-settled restricted stock units awarded to some associates as part of their year-end compensation, we may recognize additional expense as a result of changes in the price of our common stock during the vesting period to the extent we do not effectively hedge this exposure. The awards of cash-settled restricted stock units are stock-based compensation paid out over time based on the price of    our common stock. Although we currently plan to make those payments in cash, we have reserved the right to make some or all of the payments in shares of our common stock.  Asset values also directly impact revenues in our asset management business. We receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients’ portfolios or investments in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values can reduce the value of our clients’ portfolios or fund assets, which in turn can result in lower fees earned for managing such assets.  Our ability to successfully identify and manage our compliance and other risks is an important factor that can significantly impact our results. We seek to monitor and control our various risk exposures through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic, financial or regulatory outcome or the specifics or timing of such outcomes. Accordingly, our ability to successfully identify and manage risks facing us is an important factor that can significantly impact our results. Recent economic conditions, increased legislative and regulatory scrutiny and increased complexity of our operations, among other things, have increased and made it more difficult for us to manage our operational, compliance and other risks. For a further discussion of our risk management policies and procedures, see “Managing Risk” in the MD&A.  We may be unable to compete successfully as a result of the evolving financial services industry and market conditions. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Over time, there has been substantial consolidation among companies in the financial services industry, and this trend accelerated in 2008 and 2009 as the credit crisis led to numerous mergers and asset acquisitions among industry participants and in certain cases reorganization, restructuring, or even bankruptcy. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and financial services markets. We will continue to experience intensified competition as further consolidation in the financial services industry in connection with current market conditions may produce larger and better-capitalized companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we may face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to compete. In addition, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions to compete with technology companies in providing electronic and internet-based financial solutions. Increased competition may affect our results by creating pressure to lower prices on our products and services and reducing market share.  Our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses, including management of our existing businesses and expansion into new businesses and geographic areas, depends in part on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employees and attract new employees. We face significant competition for qualified employees both within and outside the financial services industry, including foreign-based institutions and institutions not subject to compensation or hiring restrictions imposed under any U. S. government initiatives or not subject to the same regulatory scrutiny. This is particularly the case in emerging markets, where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that may have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region. A substantial portion of our annual bonus compensation paid to our senior employees has in recent years been paid in the form of long-term awards. The value of long-term equity awards to senior employees generally           Bank of America 2009   9   Table of Contents     has been impacted by the significant decline in the market price of our common stock. We also reduced the number of employees across nearly all of our businesses in 2008 and 2009. In addition, the consolidation in the financial services industry has intensified the inherent challenges of cultural integration between differing types of financial services institutions. The combination of these events could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to retain and hire the most qualified employees.  Our inability to successfully integrate, or realize the expected benefits from, our recent acquisitions could adversely affect our results. There are significant risks and uncertainties associated with mergers. We have made several significant acquisitions in the last several years, including our acquisition of Merrill Lynch, and there is a risk that integration difficulties or a significant decline in asset valuations or cash flows may cause us not to realize expected benefits from the transactions and may affect our results, including adversely impacting the carrying value of the acquisition premium or goodwill. In particular, the success of the Merrill Lynch acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch. To realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, we must continue to successfully integrate our businesses, systems and operations. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. For example, we may fail to realize the growth opportunities and cost savings anticipated to be derived from the acquisition. Our ability to achieve these objectives has also been made more difficult as a result of the substantial challenges that we are facing in our businesses because of the current economic environment.  In addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in disruption of our and Merrill Lynch’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain sufficiently strong relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period. We will be subject to similar risks and difficulties in connection with any future acquisitions or decisions to downsize, sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix of the Corporation.  We may be adversely impacted by business, economic and political conditions in the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. We do business throughout the world, including in developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets. Our acquisition of Merrill Lynch has significantly increased our exposure to a number of risks in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including economic, market, reputational, operational, litigation and regulatory risks. Our businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. jurisdictions are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social or judicial instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization and/or confiscation of assets, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments and changes in legislation. Also, as in the United States, many non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we do business have been negatively impacted by recessionary conditions. While a number of these jurisdictions are showing signs of recovery, others continue to experience increasing levels of stress. In addition, the risk of default on sovereign debt in some non-U.S. jurisdictions is increasing and could expose us to losses.  In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions. Our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.   In addition, our revenues from emerging markets are particularly exposed to severe political, economic and financial disruptions, including significant currency devaluations, currency exchange controls and low or negative economic growth rates.  We also invest or trade in the securities of corporations and governments located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including emerging markets. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors. Furthermore, the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified, because generally non-U.S. trading markets, particularly in emerging market countries, are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets.  We are subject to geopolitical risks, including acts or threats of terrorism, and actions taken by the U.S. or other governments in response and/or military conflicts, that could adversely affect business and economic conditions abroad as well as in the United States.  For a further discussion of our foreign credit and trading portfolio, see “Credit Risk Management—Foreign Portfolio” in the MD&A.  Changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policy could adversely affect our businesses. Our businesses and earnings are affected by domestic and international fiscal and monetary policy. For example, the Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending, investing and capital raising activities and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs, and its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Our businesses and earnings are also affected by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various U.S. regulatory authorities, non-U.S. governments and international agencies. Changes in domestic and international fiscal and monetary policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict.  We may suffer losses as a result of operational risk or technical system failures. The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization. Integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our internal processes, systems, relationships with third parties and the vast array of associates and key executives in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, including losses resulting from unauthorized trades by any associates. Operational risk also encompasses the failure to implement strategic objectives in a successful, timely and cost-effective manner. Failure to properly manage operational risk subjects us to risks of loss that may vary in size, scale and scope, including loss of customers. This also includes but is not limited to operational or technical failures, unlawful tampering with our technical systems, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support, as well as the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of key individuals to perform properly. For further discussion of operational risks and our operational risk management, see “Operational Risk Management” in the MD&A.  Our inability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences could harm our businesses. Our business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses that provide a broad range of financial products and services, delivered through multiple distribution channels. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure by competitors to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. We might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services, responding or adapting to changes in           10   Bank of America 2009   Table of Contents     consumer spending and saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers.  Bank of America Corporation is a holding company and as such is dependent upon its subsidiaries for liquidity, including its ability to pay dividends. Bank of America Corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. We therefore depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common stock and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Bank of America Corporation. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds we need to make pay -   ments on our obligations or dividend payments. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. For a further discussion regarding our ability to pay dividends, see “Government Supervision and Regulation – Distributions” on page 4 of this report and Note 15 – Shareholders’ Equity and Earnings Per Common Share and Note 16 – Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
