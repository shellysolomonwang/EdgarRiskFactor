RISK FACTORS    The economic recession and disruptions in the global financial markets have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, Citigroup’s business and results of operations.The financial services industry and the capital markets have been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the economic recession and disruptions in the global financial markets. These market disruptions were initially triggered by declines that impacted the value of subprime mortgages, but spread to all mortgage and real estate asset classes, to leveraged bank loans and to nearly all asset classes, including equities. These market disruptions resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including Citigroup, causing many financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with other financial institutions or, in some cases, go bankrupt. Disruptions in the global financial markets have also adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the corporate bond markets, equity markets, debt and equity underwriting, and other elements of the financial markets. Such disruptions have caused some lenders and institutional investors to reduce and, in some cases, cease to provide funding to certain borrowers, including other financial institutions. Credit headwinds, increasingly volatile financial markets and reduced levels of business activity may continue to negatively impact Citigroup’s business, capital, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading price of Citigroup common stock, preferred stock and debt securities. Moreover, market and economic disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer confidence levels, consumer spending, personal bankruptcy rates, and levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices, among other factors, in certain of the markets in which Citigroup operates. Any of these factors, along with persistently high levels of unemployment, may result in a greater likelihood of reduced client interaction or elevated delinquencies on consumer loans, particularly with respect to Citi’s credit card and mortgage programs, or other obligations to Citigroup. This, in turn, could result in a higher level of loan losses and Citi’s allowances for credit losses, all of which could adversely affect Citigroup’s earnings. While Citigroup has instituted loss mitigation programs to work with distressed borrowers and potentially mitigate these effects, these programs are in the early stages, and it is uncertain whether they will be successful. In connection with significant government and central bank actions taken in late 2008 and in 2009, the U.S. and global economies began to see signs of stabilization in certain areas, and some early positive economic signs were observed in late 2009. Despite these positive signs, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the sustainability and pace of economic recovery, unemployment levels, the impact of the U.S. and other governments’ unwinding of their extensive economic and market supports, which may accelerate in 2010, and Citi’s delinquency and credit loss trends.   Previously enacted and potential future legislation, including legislation to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system, could require Citigroup to change certain of its business practices, impose additional costs on Citigroup or otherwise adversely affect its businesses.In addition to previously enacted governmental assistance programs designed to stabilize and stimulate the U.S. economy (including without limitation the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)), recent economic, political and market conditions have led to numerous proposals in the U.S. for changes in the regulation of the financial industry in an effort to prevent future crises and to reform the financial regulatory system. Some of these proposals have already been adopted. For example, in May 2009, the U.S. Congress enacted the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act), which, among other things, restricts certain credit card practices, requires expanded disclosures to consumers and provides consumers with the right to opt out of certain interest rate increases. Complying with these legislative changes, as well as the requirements of the amendments to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) adopted by the Federal Reserve Board and effective July 2010, will require Citigroup to invest significant management attention and resources to make the necessary disclosure and system changes in its U.S. card businesses and will affect the results of such businesses. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—North America Regional Consumer Banking” above and “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—2010 Credit Outlook” and“—North America Cards” below for additional information. In addition, in 2009, the Obama Administration released a comprehensive plan for regulatory reform in the financial industry. The Administration’s plan calls for significant proposed structural reforms and new substantive regulation across the financial industry, including, without limitation, requiring that broker-dealers who provide investment advice about securities to investors have the same fiduciary obligations as registered investment advisers; new requirements for the securitization market, including requiring a securitizer to retain a material economic interest in the credit risk associated with the underlying securitization; and additional regulation with respect to the trading of over-the-counter derivatives. In addition, the Administration’s plan calls for increased scrutiny and regulation, including potentially heightened capital requirements, for any financial institution whose combination of size, leverage and interconnectedness could pose a threat to market-wide financial stability if it failed. This is sometimes referred to as “systemic risk” and may adversely affect Citigroup, as well as the financial intermediaries with which it interacts on a daily basis such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges.   54        The House Financial Services Committee began considering legislation based on the Administration’s proposal, and in December 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The bill calls for comprehensive financial regulatory reform and would create a Consumer Protection Agency whose mandate includes measures that would subject federally chartered financial institutions to state consumer protection laws that have historically been preempted. The bill would also provide Federal regulators with the authority to rein in or dismantle financial institutions whose collapse could pose a systemic risk to the financial stability or economy of the U.S. due to their size, leverage or interconnectedness. The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee also issued a discussion draft of a bill in November 2009 based on the Administration’s proposal, which differs significantly from the House bill in many respects. More recently, in early 2010, the Obama Administration proposed further restrictions on the size and scope of banks and other financial institutions. There can be no assurance as to whether or when any of the parts of the Administration’s plan or other proposals will be enacted into legislation and, if adopted, what the final provisions of such legislation will be. New legislation and regulatory changes could require Citigroup to further change certain of its business practices, impose additional costs on Citigroup, some significant, adversely affect its ability to pursue business opportunities it might otherwise consider engaging in, cause business disruptions or impact the value of assets that Citigroup holds.   Citigroup’s participation in government programs to modify first and second lien mortgage loans could adversely affect the amount and timing of its earnings and credit losses relating to those loans.The U.S. Treasury has announced guidelines for its first and second lien modification programs under the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). Citigroup began participating in the HAMP with respect to first mortgages during the second quarter of 2009 and is actively engaged in discussions with the U.S. Treasury for the second lien program. Participation in the HAMP could result in a reduction in the principal balances of certain first and second lien mortgage loans and the acceleration of loss recognition on those loans. In addition to the principal reduction aspect of the programs, loan modification efforts can impact the interest rate and term of these loans, which would in turn impact the total return on those assets and the timing of those returns. Participation in the programs as a servicer could also reduce servicing income to the extent the principal balance of a serviced loan is reduced or because it increases the cost of servicing a loan.  In order to participate in the HAMP, borrowers must currently complete a three- to five-month trial period during which the original terms of the loans remain in effect pending final modification. As a result, Citigroup is uncertain of the overall impact the HAMP will have on its delinquency trends, net credit losses and other loan loss metrics.   The expiration of a provision of the U.S. tax law that allows Citigroup to defer U.S. taxes on certain active financial services income could significantly increase Citi’s tax expense.Citigroup’s tax provision has historically been reduced because active financing income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. is taxed at the lower local tax rate rather than at the higher U.S. tax rate. Such reduction has been dependent upon a provision of the U.S. tax law that defers the imposition of U.S. taxes on certain active financial services income until that income is repatriated to the U.S. as a dividend. This “active financing exception” expired on December 31, 2009, and while it has been scheduled to expire on five prior occasions and has been extended each time, there can be no assurance that the exception will continue to be extended. The Obama Administration’s 2011 budget proposal includes a two-year extension of the active financing exception. In addition, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a one-year extension of the exception that is now pending a vote in the U.S. Senate. In the event this exception is not extended beyond 2009, the U.S. tax imposed on Citi’s active financing income earned outside the U.S. would increase, which could further result in Citi’s tax expense increasing significantly.    Citigroup’s businesses are subject to risks arising from extensive operations outside the United States. As a global participant in the financial services industry, Citigroup is subject to extensive regulation, including fiscal and monetary policies, in jurisdictions around the world. As a result of the current financial crisis, there are currently numerous reform efforts underway outside the U.S., including without limitation proposals by the European Commission to amend bank capital requirements and by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom to enhance regulatory standards applicable to financial institutions. This level of regulation could further increase in all jurisdictions in which Citigroup conducts business. Any regulatory changes could lead to business disruptions or could impact the value of assets that Citigroup holds or the scope or profitability of its business activities. Such changes could also require Citigroup to change certain of its business practices and could expose Citigroup to additional costs, including compliance costs, and liabilities as well as reputational harm. To the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services institutions, such changes would also make it more difficult for Citigroup to distinguish itself from competitors.  55        In addition, the emerging markets in which Citigroup operates or invests, or in which it may do so in the future, particularly as a result of its overall strategy, may be more volatile than the U.S. markets or other developed markets outside the U.S. and are subject to changing political, economic, financial and social factors. Among other factors, these include the possibility of recent or future changes in political leadership and economic and fiscal policies and the possible imposition of, or changes in, currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions applicable to companies or investments in these countries. Citigroup’s inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a materially adverse effect not only on its business in that market but also on its reputation generally.   Future issuances of Citigroup common stock and preferred stock may reduce any earnings available to Citi’s common stockholders and the return on the company’s equity.During 2009, Citigroup raised a total of approximately $79 billion in private and public offerings of common stock in connection with its exchange offers and as required by the U.S. government pursuant to Citigroup’s repayment of TARP. This amount does not include approximately $3.5 billion of tangible equity units issued in December 2009 that will be settled for additional shares of Citigroup common stock that may be issued over a three-year period but in no event later than December 2012. In addition, in January 2010, Citigroup issued $1.7 billion of common stock equivalents to its employees in lieu of cash compensation they would have otherwise received. Subject to shareholder approval at Citi’s annual shareholder meeting scheduled to be held on April 20, 2010, such amount of common stock equivalents will be converted to common stock. Further, pursuant to its agreement with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), entered into in November 2007, Citi will issue an aggregate of $7.5 billion of common stock, at a price per share of $31.83, over an approximately two-year period beginning in March 2010. While this additional capital has provided, or will provide, funding to Citigroup’s businesses and has improved, or will improve, Citigroup’s financial position and capital strength, it has increased, or will increase, Citigroup’s equity and the number of actual and diluted shares of Citigroup common stock. Such increases in the outstanding shares of common stock reduce Citigroup’s earnings per share and the return on Citigroup’s equity, unless Citigroup’s earnings increase correspondingly. In addition, any additional future issuances of common stock, including without limitation pursuant to U.S. governmental requirements or programs, could further dilute the existing common stockholders and any earnings available to the common stockholders.   The sale by the U.S. Treasury of its stake in Citigroup will result in a substantial amount of Citigroup common stock entering the market, which could adversely affect the market price of Citigroup common stock.As of December 31, 2009, the U.S. Treasury held a 27.0% ownership stake in Citigroup. In December 2009, the U.S. Treasury announced that it planned to divest its stake during 2010, subject to market conditions and following a 90-day lockup period that will expire on March 16, 2010, resulting in approximately 7.7 billion shares of Citigroup common stock being sold into the market. The divestiture of such a large number of shares of Citigroup common stock within the announced timeframe could adversely affect the market price of Citigroup common stock.   Citigroup’s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets (DTAs) to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if it experiences an “ownership change” under the Internal Revenue Code.As of December 31, 2009, Citigroup had recognized net DTAs of approximately $46.1 billion, which are included in its tangible common equity. Citigroup’s ability to utilize its DTAs to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if Citigroup experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in Citigroup’s ownership by “5-percent shareholders” (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. The common stock issued pursuant to the exchange offers in July 2009, and the common stock and tangible equity units issued in December 2009 as part of Citigroup’s TARP repayment, did not result in an ownership change under the Code. However, these common stock issuances have materially increased the risk that Citigroup will experience an ownership change in the future. On June 9, 2009, the Board of Directors of Citigroup adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan. This Plan is subject to shareholders’ approval at the 2010 Annual Meeting. The purpose of the Plan is to minimize the likelihood of an ownership change occurring for Section 382 purposes. Despite adoption of the Plan, future transactions in Citigroup stock that may not be in its control may cause Citigroup to experience an ownership change and thus limit its ability to utilize its DTAs, as well as cause a reduction in Citigroup’s tangible common equity and stockholders’ equity.   Increases in FDIC insurance premiums and other proposed fees on banks may adversely affect Citigroup’s earnings.During 2008 and continuing in 2009, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the deposit insurance fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased, and may further increase in the future, assessment rates of insured institutions. In November 2009, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring banks to prepay three years of estimated premiums to replenish the depleted insurance fund, which Citigroup paid in the fourth quarter of 2009. There have also been proposals to change the basis on which these assessment rates are determined. Moreover, the Obama Administration has recently suggested the imposition of other fees on banking institutions. Citigroup is generally unable to control the basis or the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance or the levying of other fees or assessments on financial institutions. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, Citigroup may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. These announced increases and prepayments, and any future increases or other required fees, could adversely impact Citigroup’s earnings.  56       Citigroup’s businesses may be materially adversely affected if it is unable to hire and retain qualified employees.Citigroup’s performance is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of the highly skilled individuals that Citigroup is able to attract and retain. Competition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside of the financial services industry for qualified employees has often been intense. Citigroup is required to comply with the U.S. government’s standards for executive compensation and related corporate governance set forth in the ARRA generally for so long as the U.S. government holds certain Citigroup securities. These standards generally apply to Citigroup’s senior-most executives and certain other highly compensated employees. The incentive compensation arrangements for Citigroup’s top 30 most highly compensated employees are also subject to review under the incentive compensation principles set by the Federal Reserve Board, in consultation with Citi’s other regulators. In addition, the U.K. recently imposed a one-time 50% tax on bonuses above a certain amount paid to employees of banks operating in the country. Furthermore, the market price of Citigroup common stock has declined significantly from a closing price of $55.12 on May 25, 2007. Because a substantial portion of Citigroup’s annual bonus compensation paid to its senior employees has been paid in the form of equity, such awards may not be as valuable from a compensatory or retention perspective. There can be no assurance that, as a result of these restrictions, or any potential future compensation restrictions or guidelines imposed on Citigroup, Citigroup will be able to attract new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees, which may in turn affect its ability to compete effectively in its businesses, manage its businesses effectively and expand into new businesses and geographic regions.    Failure to maintain the value of the Citigroup brand may adversely affect its businesses.Citigroup’s success depends on the continued strength and recognition of the Citigroup brand on a global basis. The Citi name is integral to its business as well as to the implementation of its strategy for expanding its businesses, including outside the U.S. Maintaining, promoting and positioning the Citigroup brand will depend largely on the success of its ability to provide consistent, high-quality financial services and products to its clients around the world. Citigroup’s brand could be adversely affected if it fails to achieve these objectives or if its public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative views about Citigroup or the financial services industry in general, or by a negative perception of Citigroup’s short-term or long-term financial prospects. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Citigroup’s businesses.   Although Citigroup currently believes it is “well capitalized,” its capitalization may not prove to be sufficiently consistent with its risk profile or sufficiently robust relative to future capital requirements.Citigroup’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with Citigroup’s risk profile, all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines as well as external rating agency conditions. Citigroup is subject to the risk based capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Capital adequacy is measured, in part, based on two risk based capital ratios, the Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital) ratios. In conjunction with the conclusion of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), U.S. banking regulators developed a new measure of capital called Tier 1 Common. While Tier 1 Common and related ratios are measures used and relied on by U.S. banking regulators, they are non-GAAP financial measures for SEC purposes. See “Capital Resources and Liquidity” above for additional information on these metrics. Citigroup is also subject to a Leverage ratio requirement, a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy. For additional information on these capital adequacy metrics, including the estimated impact to Citi’s capital ratios of adopting SFAS 166 and SFAS 167 as of January 1, 2010, see “Capital Resources and Liquidity—Capital Resources.” To be “well capitalized” under U.S. federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 Capital ratio of at least 6%, a Total Capital ratio of at least 10% and a Leverage ratio of at least 3%, and not be subject to a Federal Reserve Board directive to maintain higher capital levels. As of December 31, 2009, Citigroup was “well capitalized,” with a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 11.7%, a Total Capital ratio of 15.2% and a Leverage ratio of 6.9%, as well as a Tier 1 Common ratio of 9.6%. There can be no assurance, however, that Citigroup will be able to maintain sufficient capital consistent with its risk profile or remain “well capitalized.” Moreover, the various regulators in the U.S. and abroad have not reached consensus as to the appropriate level of capitalization for financial services institutions such as Citigroup. These regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, may alter the current regulatory capital requirements to which Citigroup is subject and thereby necessitate equity increases that could dilute existing stockholders, lead to required asset sales or adversely impact the availability of Citi’s DTAs, as described above, among other issues. In addition, Citigroup could adopt the provisions of the Basel II regulatory capital framework as early as April 1, 2011. This new regulatory capital framework is likely to result in a need for Citigroup to hold additional regulatory capital. If market conditions do not improve, the capital requirements of Basel II could increase prior to scheduled implementation in 2011, further increasing the amount of capital needed by Citi. The new rules could also result in changes in Citigroup’s funding mix, resulting in lower net income and/or continued shrinking of the balance sheet. Separate from the above Basel II rules for credit and operational risk, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has also proposed revisions to the market risk framework that could also lead to additional capital requirements. Although not yet ratified by the U.S. regulators, the Basel II rules for market risk are currently scheduled for January 1, 2011, one quarter ahead of Citigroup’s earliest date for Basel II implementation for credit and operational risk.  57       Liquidity is essential to Citigroup’s businesses, and Citigroup relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its operations.Adequate liquidity is essential to Citigroup’s businesses. Citigroup’s liquidity could be materially, adversely affected by factors Citigroup cannot control, such as general disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry in general. In addition, Citigroup’s ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of Citigroup’s short-term or long-term financial prospects, or a perception that it is experiencing greater liquidity risk. Regulatory measures instituted in late 2008 and 2009, such as the FDIC’s temporary guarantee of the newly issued senior debt as well as deposits in non-interest-bearing deposit transaction accounts, and the commercial paper funding facility of the Federal Reserve Board were designed to stabilize the financial markets and the liquidity position of financial institutions such as Citigroup. While much of Citigroup’s long-term and short-term unsecured funding during 2009 was issued pursuant to these government-sponsored funding programs, Citigroup began to access funding outside of these programs, particularly during the fourth quarter of 2009, due, in part, to the fact that many of these facilities were terminating. Citi’s reliance on government-sponsored short-term funding facilities was substantially reduced as of the end of 2009. The impact that the termination of any of these facilities could have on Citigroup’s ability to access funding in the future is uncertain. It is also unclear whether Citigroup will be able to regain access to the public long-term unsecured debt markets on historically customary terms. Citigroup’s cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to its credit spreads in both the cash bond and derivatives markets. Increases in Citigroup’s credit qualifying spreads can significantly increase the cost of this funding. Credit spreads are influenced by market and rating agency perceptions of Citigroup’s creditworthiness and may be influenced by movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to Citigroup’s long-term debt. In addition, a significant portion of Citigroup’s business activities are based on gathering deposits and borrowing money and then lending or investing those funds, including through market-making activities in tradable securities. Citigroup’s profitability is in part a function of the spread between interest rates earned on such loans and investments, as well as other interest-earning assets, and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. During 2009, the need to maintain adequate liquidity caused Citigroup to invest available funds in lower-yielding assets, such as those issued by the U.S. government. As a result, during 2009, the yields across both the interest-earning assets and the interest-bearing liabilities dropped significantly from 2008. The lower asset yields more than offset the lower cost of funds, resulting in lower net interest margins compared to 2008. There can be no assurance that Citigroup’s net interest margins will not continue to remain low.   Any reduction in Citigroup’s and its subsidiaries’ credit ratings could increase the cost of its funding from, and restrict its access to, the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.Each of Citigroup’s and Citibank, N.A.’s long-term/senior debt is currently rated investment grade by Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s. The rating agencies regularly evaluate Citigroup and its subsidiaries, and their ratings of Citigroup’s and its subsidiaries’ long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within the control of Citigroup and its subsidiaries, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets generally, or as a result of events affecting Citigroup more specifically, Citigroup and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings. A reduction in Citigroup’s or its subsidiaries’ credit ratings could adversely affect Citigroup’s liquidity, widen its credit spreads or otherwise increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets or trigger obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of Citigroup’s trading and collateralized financing contracts. In addition, under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate certain contracts with Citigroup or require it to post additional collateral. Termination of Citigroup’s trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause Citigroup to sustain losses and impair its liquidity by requiring Citigroup to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities transfers. For additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in Citigroup’s or its subsidiaries’ credit ratings, see “Capital Resources and Liquidity.” Certain of the credit rating agencies have stated that the credit ratings of Citi and other financial institutions have benefited from the implicit support that the U.S. government and regulators have provided to the financial industry through the financial crisis. The expectation that this support will be reduced over time, unless offset by improvement in standalone credit profiles, could have a negative impact on the credit ratings of financial institutions, including Citi.    Market disruptions may increase the risk of customer or counterparty delinquency or default.Market and economic disruptions, as well as the policies of the Federal Reserve Board or other government agencies or entities, can adversely affect Citigroup’s customers, obligors on securities or other instruments or other counterparties, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their securities or loans or otherwise default on their contractual obligations to Citigroup, some of which maybe significant. These customers, obligors or counterparties could include individuals or corporate or governmental entities. Moreover, Citigroup may incur significant credit risk exposure from holding securities or other obligations or entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which obligors or other counterparties have long-term obligations to make payments to Citigroup. Market conditions over the last several years, including credit deterioration, decreased liquidity and pricing transparency along with increased market volatility, have negatively impacted Citigroup‘s credit risk exposure. Although Citigroup regularly reviews its credit exposures, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.  58       Citigroup may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the realignment of its businesses.Effective in the second quarter of 2009, Citigroup realigned into two primary business segments, Citicorp and Citi Holdings, for management and reporting purposes. The realignment is part of Citigroup’s strategy to focus on its core businesses and reduce non-core assets in a disciplined and deliberate manner. Citigroup believes this structure will allow it to enhance the capabilities and performance of Citigroup’s core assets, through Citicorp, as well as realize value from its non-core assets, through Citi Holdings. Citigroup intends to exit the Citi Holdings non-core businesses as quickly as practicable yet in an economically rational manner through business divestitures, portfolio run-off and asset sales. Citigroup has been making substantial progress divesting and exiting businesses included within Citi Holdings, having completed more than 20 divestitures over the last two years, including the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, Nikko Cordial Securities and Nikko Asset Management sales. Citi Holdings’ assets have been reduced from a peak level of approximately $898 billion in the first quarter of 2008 to approximately $547 billion at year-end 2009. Despite these efforts, given the rapidly changing and uncertain financial environment, there can be no assurance that the realignment of Citigroup’s businesses will achieve the company’s desired objectives or benefits, including simplifying the organization and permitting Citigroup to allocate capital to fund its long-term strategic businesses comprising Citicorp, or that Citi will be able to continue to make progress in divesting or exiting businesses within Citi Holdings in an orderly and timely manner.   Citigroup may experience further write-downs of its financial instruments and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions.Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets have made it extremely difficult to value certain of Citigroup’s assets. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the values of these assets in future periods. In addition, at the time of any sales of these assets, the price Citigroup ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Further, Citigroup’s hedging strategies with respect to these assets may not be effective. Any of these factors could require Citigroup to take further write-downs in respect of these assets, which may negatively affect Citigroup’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods. Citigroup finances and acquires principal positions in a number of real estate and real-estate-related products for its own account, for investment vehicles managed by affiliates in which it also may have a significant investment, for separate accounts managed by affiliates and for major participants in the commercial and residential real estate markets, and originates loans secured by commercial and residential properties. Citigroup also securitizes and trades in a wide range of commercial and residential real estate and real-estate-related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate and commercial assets and products, including residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities. These businesses have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the downturn in the real estate sector.     Furthermore, in the past, Citigroup has provided financial support to certain of its investment products and vehicles in difficult market conditions, and Citigroup may decide to do so again in the future for contractual reasons or, at its discretion, for reputational or business reasons, including through equity investments or cash or capital infusions. Should unemployment rates continue to be high, and if stresses in the real estate market continue to depress housing prices, Citi could experience greater write-offs and also need to set aside larger loan loss reserves for mortgage and credit card portfolios as well as other consumer loans.   The elimination of QSPEs from the guidance in SFAS 140 and changes in FIN 46(R) will significantly impact, and may continue to significantly impact, Citigroup’s Consolidated Financial Statements.During 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, which eliminates Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs) from the guidance in SFAS No. 140, and SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which makes three key changes to the consolidation model in FIN 46(R), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”. Such changes include: (i) former QSPEs will now be included in the scope of SFAS No. 167; (ii) FIN 46(R) has been amended to change the method of analyzing which party to a variable interest entity (VIE) should consolidate the VIE to a qualitative determination of “power” combined with potentially significant benefits or losses; and (iii) the analysis of primary beneficiaries has to be re-evaluated whenever circumstances change. These standards became effective January 1, 2010, including for Citigroup, and they will have a significant impact, and may have an ongoing significant impact, on Citigroup’s Consolidated Financial Statements as Citi will be required to bring a portion of assets that were not historically on its balance sheet onto its balance sheet, which will also impact Citi’s capital ratios. For a further discussion of these changes, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also “Capital Resources and Liquidity—Capital Resources.”   Citigroup’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates, which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future.Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, Citigroup is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying Citigroup’s financial statements are incorrect, Citigroup may experience material losses. For additional information, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates.”    Changes in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how Citigroup records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.Citigroup’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Citigroup’s financial statements. These changes can be hard   59       to anticipate and implement and can materially impact how Citigroup records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. For example, the FASB’s current financial instruments project could, among other things, significantly change the way loan loss provisions are determined from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model, and may also result in most financial instruments being required to be reported at fair value.   Citigroup may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies, and concentration of risk increases the potential for such losses.Citigroup seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. While Citigroup employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Market conditions over the last several years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. These market movements can, and have, limited the effectiveness of Citigroup’s hedging strategies and have caused Citigroup to incur significant losses, and they may do so again in the future. In addition, concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in certain of Citigroup’s businesses. For example, Citigroup extends large commitments as part of its credit origination activities. Citigroup’s inability to reduce its credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market dislocation, could negatively affect its results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans. Further, Citigroup routinely executes a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks and investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this industry.   The financial services industry faces substantial legal liability and regulatory risks, and Citigroup may face damage to its reputation and incur significant legal and regulatory liability.Citigroup faces significant legal and regulatory risks in its businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Citigroup’s experience has been that legal claims by shareholders, regulators, customers and clients increase in a market downturn. In addition, employment-related claims typically increase in periods when Citigroup has reduced the total number of employees, such as during the prior two fiscal    years. There have also been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and Citigroup runs the risk that employee misconduct could occur. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct, and the extensive precautions Citigroup takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. For further information relating to Citigroup’s legal and regulatory risks, see “Legal Proceedings” and Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   A failure in Citigroup’s operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair its liquidity, disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage Citigroup’s reputation and cause losses.Citigroup’s businesses are highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services Citigroup provides to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of Citigroup’s client base and its geographical reach, developing and maintaining Citigroup’s operational systems and infrastructure is challenging. Citigroup’s financial, account, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, such as a spike in transaction volume or unforeseen catastrophic events, adversely affecting Citigroup’s ability to process these transactions or provide these services. Citigroup also faces the risk of operational failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries Citigroup uses to facilitate its transactions, and as Citigroup’s interconnectivity with its clients grows, it increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to its clients’ systems. In addition, Citigroup’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Although Citigroup takes protective measures and endeavors to modify them as circumstances warrant, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. Given the high volume of transactions at Citigroup, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified. If one or more of such events occurs, this could potentially jeopardize Citigroup’s, its clients’, its counterparties’ or third parties’ confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, Citigroup’s computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in Citigroup’s, its clients’, its counterparties’ or third parties’ operations, which could result in significant losses or reputational damage.  60      MANAGING GLOBAL RISK
