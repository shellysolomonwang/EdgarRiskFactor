RISK FACTORS    The ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 will require Citigroup to restructure or change certain of its business practices and potentially reduce revenues or otherwise limit its profitability, including by imposing additional costs on Citigroup, some of which may be significant. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Financial Reform Act), signed into law on July 21, 2010, calls for significant structural reforms and new substantive regulation across the financial industry. Because most of the provisions of the Financial Reform Act that could particularly impact Citi are currently or will be subject to extensive rulemaking and interpretation, a significant amount of uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact of the Financial Reform Act on Citigroup, especially when combined with other ongoing U.S. and global regulatory developments.  This uncertainty impedes future planning with respect to certain of Citi’s businesses and, combined with the extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements adopted and implemented in compressed time frames, presents operational and compliance costs and risks. What is certain is that the Financial Reform Act will require Citigroup to restructure, transform or change certain of its business activities and practices, potentially limit or eliminate Citi’s ability to pursue business opportunities, and impose additional costs, some significant, on Citigroup, each of which could negatively impact, possibly significantly, Citigroup’s earnings.    Increases in FDIC insurance premiums will significantly increase Citi’s required premiums, which will negatively impact Citigroup’s earnings. The FDIC maintains a fund out of which it covers losses on insured deposits. The fund is composed of assessments on financial institutions that hold FDIC-insured deposits, including Citibank, N.A. and Citigroup’s other FDIC-insured depository institutions. As a result of the recent financial crisis, the Financial Reform Act seeks to put the FDIC fund on a sounder financial footing by requiring that the fund have assets equal to at least 1.35% of insurable deposits. The FDIC has adopted a higher target of 2.0% of insurable deposits.  The cost of FDIC assessments to FDIC-insured depository institutions, including Citibank, N.A. and Citigroup’s other FDIC-insured depository institutions, depends on the assessment rate and the assessment base of each institution. The Financial Reform Act changed the assessment base from the amount of U.S. domestic deposits to the amount of worldwide average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity. The FDIC has adopted a complex set of calculation rules for its assessment rate, to be effective in the second quarter of 2011. As a result of these changes, Citigroup’s FDIC assessments could increase significantly (prior to any potential mitigating actions), which will negatively impact its earnings. Given Citi’s substantial global footprint, the change from an assessment based on Citigroup’s relatively smaller U.S. deposit base, as compared to its U.S. competitors, to one related to global assets (including Citigroup’s relatively larger global deposit base as compared to its U.S. competitors) will cause a   disproportionate increase in Citigroup’s assessment base relative to many of its U.S. competitors that are subject to the FDIC assessment. The assessment could also disadvantage Citi’s competitive position in relation to foreign local banks which are not subject to the assessment.    Although Citigroup currently believes it is “well capitalized,” prospective regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions are uncertain and Citi’s capitalization may not prove to be sufficient relative to future requirements. The prospective regulatory capital standards for financial institutions are currently subject to significant debate and rulemaking activity, both in the U.S. and internationally, resulting in a degree of uncertainty as to their ultimate scope and effect.  As an outgrowth of the financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) has established global financial reforms designed, in part, to strengthen existing capital requirements (Basel III). Under Basel III, when fully phased in, Citigroup would be subject to stated minimum capital ratio requirements for Tier 1 Common of 4.5%, for Tier 1 Capital of 6.0%, and for Total Capital of 8.0%. Further, the new standards also require a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, and potentially also a countercyclical capital buffer, above these stated minimum requirements for each of these three capital tiers. Apart from risk-based capital, Basel III also introduced a more constrained Leverage ratio requirement than that currently imposed on U.S. banking organizations. For more information on Basel III and other requirements and proposals relating to capital adequacy, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards Developments” above.  Even though Citigroup continues to be “well capitalized” in accordance with current federal bank regulatory agency definitions, with a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 12.9%, a Total Capital ratio of 16.6%, and a Leverage ratio of 6.6%, as well as a Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.8%, each as of December 31, 2010, Citigroup may not be able to maintain sufficient capital consistent with Basel III and other future regulatory capital requirements. Because the rules relating to the U.S. implementation of Basel III and other future regulatory capital requirements are not entirely certain, Citigroup’s ability to comply with these requirements on a timely basis depends upon certain assumptions, including, for instance, those with respect to Citigroup’s significant investments in unconsolidated financial entities (such as the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture), the size of Citigroup’s deferred tax assets and MSRs, and its internal risk calibration models. If any of these assumptions proves to be incorrect, it could negatively affect Citigroup’s ability to comply in a timely manner with these future regulatory capital requirements.  In addition, the Financial Reform Act grants new regulatory authority to various U.S. federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and a newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council, to impose heightened prudential standards on financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to market-wide financial stability (Citigroup will be defined as such an institution under the Financial Reform Act). These standards include heightened capital, leverage and liquidity standards, as well as requirements    51          for periodic stress tests (the first round of which is in the process of being implemented). The Federal Reserve Board may also impose other prudential standards, including contingent capital requirements, based upon its authority to distinguish among bank holding companies such as Citigroup in relation to their perceived riskiness, complexity, activities, size and other factors. The exact nature of these future requirements remains uncertain.  Further, the so-called “Collins Amendment” reflected in the Financial Reform Act will result in new minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies such as Citigroup, and provides for the phase-out of trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 Capital for regulatory capital purposes, beginning January 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, Citigroup had approximately $15.4 billion in outstanding trust preferred securities that will be subject to the provisions of the Collins Amendment. As a result, Citigroup may need to replace certain of its existing Tier 1 Capital with new capital.  Accordingly, Citigroup may not be able to maintain sufficient capital in light of the changing and uncertain regulatory capital requirements resulting from the Financial Reform Act, the Basel Committee, and U.S. or international regulators, or Citigroup’s costs to maintain such capital levels may increase.    Changes in regulation of derivatives under the Financial Reform Act, including certain central clearing and exchange trading activities, will require Citigroup to restructure certain areas of its derivatives business which will be disruptive and may adversely affect the results of operations from certain of its over-the-counter and other derivatives activities. The Financial Reform Act and the regulations to be promulgated thereunder will require certain over-the-counter derivatives to be standardized, subject to requirements for transaction reporting, clearing through regulatorily recognized clearing facilities and trading on exchanges or exchange-like facilities. The regulations implementing this aspect of the Financial Reform Act, including for example the definition of, and requirements for, “swap execution facilities” through which transactions and reporting in standardized products may be required to be carried out, and the determination of margin requirements, are still in the process of being formulated, and thus, the final scope of the requirements is not known. These requirements will, however, necessitate changes to certain areas of Citi’s derivatives business structures and practices, including without limitation the successful and timely installation of the appropriate technological and operational systems to report and trade the applicable derivatives accurately, which will be disruptive, divert management attention and require additional investment into such businesses.  The above changes could also increase Citigroup’s exposure to the regulatorily recognized clearing facilities and exchanges, which could build up into material concentrations of exposure. This could result in Citigroup having a significant dependence on the continuing efficient and effective functioning of these clearing and trading facilities, and on their continuing financial stability.    In addition, under the so-called “push-out” provisions of the Financial Reform Act and the regulations to be promulgated thereunder, derivatives activities, with the exception of bona fide hedging activities and derivatives related to traditional bank-permissible reference assets, will be curtailed on FDIC-insured depository institutions. Citigroup, like many of its U.S. bank competitors, conducts a substantial portion of its derivatives activities through an insured depository institution. Moreover, to the extent that certain of Citi’s competitors conduct such activities outside of FDIC-insured depository institutions, Citi would be disproportionately impacted by any restructuring of its business for push-out purposes. While the exact nature of the changes required under the Financial Reform Act is uncertain, the changes that are ultimately implemented will require restructuring these activities which could negatively impact Citi’s results of operations from these activities.    Regulatory requirements aimed at facilitating the future orderly resolution of large financial institutions could result in Citigroup having to change its business structures, activities and practices in ways that negatively impact its operations. The Financial Reform Act requires Citi to plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of future material financial distress or failure, and to provide its regulators information regarding the manner in which Citibank, N.A. and its other insured depository institutions are adequately protected from the risk of non-bank affiliates. Regulatory requirements aimed at facilitating future resolutions in the U.S. and globally could result in Citigroup having to restructure or reorganize businesses, legal entities, or intercompany systems or transactions in ways that negatively impact Citigroup’s operations. For example, Citi could be required to create new subsidiaries instead of branches in foreign jurisdictions, or create separate subsidiaries to house particular businesses or operations (so-called “subsidiarization”), which would, among other things, increase Citi’s legal, regulatory and managerial costs, negatively impact Citi’s global capital and liquidity management and potentially impede its global strategy.    While Citigroup believes one of its competitive advantages is its extensive global network, Citi’s extensive operations outside of the U.S. subject it to emerging market and sovereign volatility and numerous inconsistent or conflicting regulations, which increase Citi’s compliance, regulatory and other costs. Citigroup believes its extensive global network—which includes a physical presence in approximately 100 countries and services offered in over 160 countries and jurisdictions—provides it a competitive advantage in servicing the broad financial services needs of large multinational clients and its customers around the world, including in many of the world’s emerging markets. This global footprint, however, subjects Citi to emerging market and sovereign volatility and extensive, often inconsistent or conflicting, regulation, all of which increase Citi’s compliance, regulatory and other costs.    52           The emerging markets in which Citi operates or invests are often more volatile than the U.S. markets or other developed markets, and are subject to changing political, social, economic and financial factors, including currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions applicable to companies or investments in those markets or countries. Citi’s extensive global operations also expose it to sovereign risk, particularly in the countries in which Citi has a physical presence. There have recently been instances of disruptions and internal strife in some countries in which Citigroup operates which can place Citi’s staff at risk and can result in losses, particularly if the sovereign defaults or nationalizes Citi’s assets. These risks must be balanced against Citigroup’s obligations to its customers in the country and its obligations to the central bank as a major international participant in the functioning of the country’s wholesale market. In addition, Citi’s global footprint also subjects it to higher compliance risk relating to U.S. regulations primarily focused on various aspects of global corporate activities, such as anti-money laundering and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations, which can also be more acute in less developed markets and which can require substantial investments in order to comply. Citigroup believes the level of regulation of financial institutions around the world will likely further increase as a result of the recent financial crisis and the numerous regulatory efforts underway outside the U.S., which, to date, have not necessarily been undertaken on a coordinated basis. For example, uncertainties in the global regulatory arena that could impact Citigroup include, among others, different and inconsistent insolvency and resolution regimes and capital and liquidity requirements that may result in mandatory “ring-fencing” of capital or liquidity in certain jurisdictions, thus increasing Citigroup’s overall global capital and liquidity needs, as well as the possibility of bank taxes or fees, some of which could be significant. The extensive regulations to which Citi is subject, or may be subject in the future, are often inconsistent or conflicting, not only with U.S. regulations, but among jurisdictions around the world. Moreover, depending on the final regulations, Citi could be disproportionately impacted in comparison to other global financial institutions. Any failure by Citi to remain in compliance with applicable U.S. regulations as well as the regulations in the countries and markets in which it operates as a result of its global footprint could result in fines, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, any of which could negatively impact Citi’s earnings as well as its reputation generally. In addition, complying with inconsistent, conflicting or duplicative regulations requires extensive time and effort and further increases Citigroup’s compliance, regulatory and other costs.   Provisions of the Financial Reform Act and other regulations relating to securitizations will impose additional costs on securitization transactions, increase Citigroup’s potential liability in respect of securitizations and may prohibit Citigroup from performing certain roles in securitizations, each of which could make it impractical to execute certain types of transactions and may have an overall negative effect on the recovery of the securitization markets. Citigroup plays a variety of roles in asset securitization transactions, including acting as underwriter of asset-backed securities, depositor of the underlying assets into securitization vehicles and counterparty to securitization vehicles under derivative contracts. The Financial Reform Act contains a number of provisions intended to increase the regulation of securitizations. These include a requirement that securitizers retain un-hedged exposure to at least 5% of the economic risk of certain assets they securitize, a prohibition on securitization participants engaging in transactions that would involve a conflict with investors in the securitization and extensive additional requirements for review and disclosure of the characteristics of the assets underlying securitizations. In addition, the FDIC has adopted new criteria for establishing transfers of assets into securitization transactions from entities subject to its resolution authority, and the FASB has modified the requirements for transfers of assets to be recognized for financial accounting purposes and for securitization vehicles to be consolidated with a securitization participant. In April 2010, the SEC proposed further additional, extensive regulation of securitization transactions.  The cumulative effect of these extensive regulatory changes, as well as other potential future regulatory changes (e.g., GSE reform), on the nature and profitability of securitization transactions, and Citi’s participation therein, cannot currently be assessed. It is likely, however, that these various measures will increase the costs of executing securitization transactions, could effectively limit Citi’s overall volume of, and the role Citi may play in, securitizations, expose Citigroup to additional potential liability for securitization transactions and make it impractical for Citigroup to execute certain types of securitization transactions it previously executed. In addition, certain sectors of the overall securitization markets, such as residential mortgage-backed securitizations, have been inactive or experienced dramatically diminished transaction volumes for the last several years due to the financial crisis. The recovery of the overall securitization markets, and thus the opportunities for Citigroup to participate in securitization transactions, could also be adversely affected by these various regulatory reform measures.    53          The credit rating agencies continuously review the ratings of Citigroup and its subsidiaries, and have particularly focused on the impact of the Financial Reform Act on the ratings support assumptions of U.S. bank holding companies, including Citigroup. Reductions in Citigroup’s and its subsidiaries’ credit ratings could have a significant and immediate impact on Citi’s funding and liquidity through cash obligations, reduced funding capacity and collateral triggers. Each of Citigroup’s and Citibank, N.A.’s long-term/senior debt and short-term/commercial paper ratings are currently rated investment grade by Fitch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (S&P). The rating agencies continuously evaluate Citigroup and its subsidiaries, and their ratings of Citigroup’s and its subsidiaries’ long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including financial strength, as well as factors not entirely within the control of Citigroup and its subsidiaries, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally.  Moreover, each of Fitch, Moody’s and S&P has indicated that they are evaluating the impact of the Financial Reform Act on the rating support assumptions currently included in their methodologies as related to large U.S. bank holding companies, including Citigroup. These evaluations are generally a result of the rating agencies’ belief that the Financial Reform Act, including the establishment and development of the new orderly liquidation regime, increases the uncertainty regarding the U.S. government’s willingness and ability to provide extraordinary support to such companies. Consistent with this belief and to bring Citigroup in line with other large U.S. banks, during 2010, S&P and Moody’s revised their outlooks on Citigroup’s supported ratings from stable to negative, and Fitch placed Citigroup’s supported ratings on negative rating watch. The ultimate timing of the completion of the credit rating agencies’ evaluations, as well as the outcomes, is uncertain.  In light of these reviews and the continued focus on the financial services industry generally, Citigroup and its subsidiaries may not be able to maintain their current respective ratings. Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could have a significant and immediate impact on Citi’s funding and liquidity through cash obligations, reduced funding capacity and collateral triggers. A reduction in Citigroup’s or its subsidiaries’ credit ratings could also widen Citi’s credit spreads or otherwise increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets. For additional information on the potential impact of a reduction in Citigroup’s or its subsidiaries’ credit ratings, see “Capital Resources and Liquidity—Funding and Liquidity—Credit Ratings” above.   The restrictions imposed on proprietary trading and funds-related activities by the Financial Reform Act and the regulations thereunder will limit Citigroup’s trading for its own account and could also, depending on the scope of the final regulations, adversely impact Citigroup’s market-making activities and force Citi to dispose of certain of its investments at less than fair market value. The so-called “Volcker Rule” provisions of the Financial Reform Act restrict the proprietary trading activities of depository institutions, entities that own or control depository institutions and their affiliates. The ultimate contours of the restrictions on proprietary trading will depend on the final regulations. The rulemaking must address, among other things, the scope of permissible market-making and hedging activities. The ultimate outcome of the rulemaking process as to these and other issues is currently uncertain and, accordingly, so is the level of compliance and monitoring costs and the degree to which Citigroup’s trading activities, and the results of operations from those activities, will be negatively impacted. In addition, any restrictions imposed by final regulations in this area will affect Citigroup’s trading activities globally, and thus will likely impact it disproportionately in comparison to foreign financial institutions which will not be subject to the Volcker Rule provisions of the Financial Reform Act with respect to their activities outside of the United States.  In addition, the Volcker Rule restricts Citigroup’s funds-related activities, including Citi’s ability to sponsor or invest in private equity and/or hedge funds. Under the Financial Reform Act, bank regulators have the flexibility to provide firms with extensions allowing them to hold their otherwise restricted investments in private equity and hedge funds for some time beyond the statutory divestment period. If the regulators elect not to grant such extensions, Citi could be forced to divest certain of its investments in illiquid funds in the secondary market on an untimely basis. Based on the illiquid nature of the investments and the prospect that other industry participants subject to similar requirements would likely be divesting similar assets at the same time, such sales could be at substantial discounts to their otherwise current fair market value.   The establishment of the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, as well as other provisions of the Financial Reform Act and ensuing regulations, could affect Citi’s practices and operations with respect to a number of its U.S. Consumer businesses and increase its costs. The Financial Reform Act established the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB), an independent agency within the Federal Reserve Board. The CFPB was given rulemaking authority over most providers of consumer financial services in the U.S. as well as enforcement authority over the consumer operations of banks with assets over $10 billion, such as Citibank, N.A. The CFPB was also given interpretive authority with respect to numerous existing consumer financial services regulations (such as Regulation Z, Truth in Lending) that were previously interpreted by the Federal Reserve Board. Because this is an entirely new agency, the impact on Citigroup, including its retail banking, mortgages and cards businesses,    54          is largely uncertain. However, any new regulatory requirements, or modified interpretations of existing regulations, will affect Citi’s U.S. Consumer practices and operations, potentially resulting in increased compliance costs. Moreover, the Financial Reform Act also provides authority to the SEC to determine fiduciary duty standards applicable to brokers of retail customers. Any new such standards could also affect Citigroup’s business practices with retail investment customers and could have indirect additional effects on standards applicable to business with certain institutional customers.  In addition, the Financial Reform Act fundamentally altered the current balance between state and federal regulation of consumer financial law. The provisions of the Financial Reform Act relating to the doctrine of “federal preemption” may allow a broader application of state consumer financial laws to federally chartered institutions such as Citibank, N.A. and Citibank (South Dakota), N.A. In addition, the Financial Reform Act eliminated federal preemption protection for operating subsidiaries such as CitiMortgage, Inc. The Financial Reform Act also allows state authorities to bring certain types of enforcement actions against national banks under applicable law and granted states the ability to bring enforcement actions and to secure remedies against national banks for violation of CFPB regulations as well. This additional exposure to state lawsuits and enforcement actions, which could be extensive, could subject Citi to increased litigation and regulatory enforcement actions, further increasing costs.    Recent legislative and regulatory changes have imposed substantial changes and restrictions on Citi’s U.S. credit card businesses, leading to adverse financial impact and uncertainty regarding the nature of the credit card business model going forward. In May 2009, the U.S. Congress enacted the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act) which, among other things, restricts certain credit card practices, requires expanded disclosures to consumers and provides consumers with the right to opt out of certain interest rate increases. Complying with these changes, as well as the requirements of the amendments to Regulation Z adopted by the Federal Reserve Board to implement them, required Citigroup to invest significant management attention and resources to make the necessary disclosure, system and practices changes in its U.S. card businesses, and has negatively impacted Citi’s credit card revenues.  While Citi has fully implemented all of the provisions of the CARD Act that have taken effect, the so-called “look-back” rules, requiring a re-evaluation of rate increases since January 2009, remain to be implemented during 2011, and could further adversely impact Citi’s credit card revenues.  In addition to any potential ongoing financial impact, the CARD Act has raised uncertainties regarding the nature of the credit card business model going forward. These uncertainties include, among others, potential changes to revenue streams, reduction in the availability of credit to higher risk populations, and reduction in the amount of credit to eligible populations, all of which may impact the traditional credit card business model, including Citi’s.   There has been increased attention relating to mortgage representation and warranty claims, foreclosure process issues and the legitimacy of mortgage securitizations and transfers, which has increased, and may continue to increase, Citi’s potential liability with respect to mortgage repurchases or indemnification claims and its foreclosures in process. Citigroup is exposed to representation and warranty claims relating to its U.S. Consumer mortgage businesses and, to a lesser extent, through private-label residential mortgage securitizations sponsored by Citi’s S&B business. With regard to the U.S. Consumer mortgage businesses, as of December 31, 2010, Citi services approximately $456 billion of loans previously sold. During 2010, Citi increased its repurchase reserve from approximately $482 million to $969 million at December 31, 2010. See “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—Consumer Mortgage Representations and Warranties” below. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, Citigroup is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in calculating repurchase reserves. If these assumptions or estimates prove to be incorrect, the liabilities incurred in connection with successful repurchase or indemnification claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.  With regard to S&B private-label mortgage securitizations, S&B has to date received only a small number of claims for breaches of representations and warranties. Particularly in light of the increased attention to these and related matters, the number of such claims and Citi’s potential liability could increase. Citigroup is also exposed to potential underwriting liability relating to S&B mortgage securitizations as well as underwritings of other residential mortgage-backed securities sponsored and issued by third parties. See Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition, allegations of irregularities in foreclosure processes across the industry, including so-called “robo-signing” by mortgage loan servicers, and questions relating to the legitimacy of the securitization of mortgage loans and the Mortgage Electronic Registration System’s role in tracking mortgages, holding title and participating in the mortgage foreclosure process, have gained the attention of the U.S. Congress, Department of Justice, regulatory agencies, state attorneys general and the media, among other parties. Numerous governmental entities, including a number of federal agencies and all 50 state attorneys general, have commenced proceedings or otherwise sought information from various financial institutions, including Citigroup, relating to these issues. Governmental or regulatory investigations of alleged irregularities in the industry’s foreclosure processes, or any governmental or regulatory scrutiny of Citigroup’s foreclosure processes, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, the diversion of management’s attention and increased expense, and could result in fines, penalties, other equitable remedies, such as principal reduction programs, and significant legal, negative reputational and other costs.    55           While Citigroup has determined that the integrity of its current foreclosure process is sound and there are no systemic issues, in the event deficiencies materialize, or if there is any adverse industry-wide regulatory or judicial action taken with respect to mortgage foreclosures, the costs associated with Citigroup’s mortgage operations could increase significantly and Citigroup’s ability to continue to implement its current foreclosure processes could be adversely affected. Any increase or backlog in the number of foreclosures in process, whether related to Citi foreclosure process issues or industry-wide efforts to prevent or forestall foreclosure, has broader implications for Citigroup’s U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolios. Specifically, to the extent that Citigroup is unable to take possession of the underlying assets and sell the properties on a timely basis, growth in the number of foreclosures in process could:  inflate the amount of 180+ day delinquencies in Citigroup’s mortgage statistics;  increase Consumer non-accrual loans (90+ day delinquencies);  create a dampening effect on Citi’s net interest margin as non-accrual assets build on the balance sheet;  negatively impact the amounts ultimately realized for property subject to foreclosure; and  cause additional costs to be incurred in connection with legislative or regulatory investigations.   Further, any increase in the time to complete foreclosure sales may result in an increase in servicing advances and may negatively impact the value of Citigroup’s MSRs and mortgage-backed securities, in each case due to an adverse change in the expected timing and/or amount of cash flows to be received.   The continued uncertainty relating to the sustainability and pace of economic recovery has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, Citigroup’s businesses and results of operations. The financial services industry and the capital markets have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the economic recession and continued disruptions in the global financial markets. This continued uncertainty and disruption has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the corporate and sovereign bond markets, equity markets, debt and equity underwriting and other elements of the financial markets. Volatile financial markets and reduced (or only slightly increased) levels of client business activity may continue to negatively impact Citigroup’s business, capital, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading price of Citigroup’s common stock, preferred stock and debt securities.  In addition, there has recently been increased focus on the potential for sovereign debt defaults and/or significant bank failures in the Eurozone. Despite assistance packages to Greece and Ireland, and the creation in May 2010 of a joint EU-IMF European Financial Stability Facility, yields on government bonds of certain Eurozone countries, including Portugal and Spain, have continued to rise. There can be no assurance that the market disruptions in the Eurozone, including the increased cost of funding   for certain Eurozone governments, will not spread, nor can there be any assurance that future assistance packages will be available or sufficiently robust to address any further market contagion in the Eurozone or elsewhere. Moreover, market and economic disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt (including strategic defaults on home mortgages) and home prices, among other factors, particularly in Citi’s North America Consumer businesses. Combined with persistently high levels of U.S. unemployment, as well as any potential future regulatory actions, these factors could result in reduced borrower interaction and participation in Citi’s loss mitigation and modification programs, particularly Citi’s U.S. mortgage modification programs, or increase the risk of re-default by borrowers who have completed a modification, either of which could increase Citi’s net credit losses and delinquency statistics. To date, asset sales and modifications under Citi’s modification programs, including the U.S. Treasury’s Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), have been the primary drivers of improved performance within Citigroup’s U.S. Consumer mortgage portfolios (see “Managing Global Risk—Credit Risk—U.S. Consumer Mortgage Lending” and “Consumer Loan Modification Programs” below). To the extent uncertainty regarding the economic recovery continues to negatively impact consumer confidence and the consumer credit factors discussed above, Citi’s businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.   The maintenance of adequate liquidity depends on numerous factors outside of Citi’s control, including but not limited to market disruptions and regulatory and legislative liquidity requirements, and Citi’s need to maintain adequate liquidity has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, its net interest margin (NIM). Adequate liquidity is essential to Citigroup’s businesses. As seen in recent years, Citigroup’s liquidity can be, and has been, significantly and negatively impacted by factors Citigroup cannot control, such as general disruption of the financial markets, negative views about the financial services industry in general, or Citigroup’s short-term or long-term financial prospects or perception that it is experiencing greater liquidity or financial risk. Moreover, Citigroup’s ability to access the capital markets and its cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to its credit spreads in both the cash bond and derivatives markets, also outside of its control. Credit spreads are influenced by market and rating agency perceptions of Citigroup’s creditworthiness and may also be influenced by movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to Citigroup’s long-term debt. Increases in Citigroup’s credit qualifying spreads can, and did during the financial crisis, significantly increase the cost of this funding.  Further, the prospective regulatory liquidity standards for financial institutions are currently subject to rulemaking and change, both in the U.S. and internationally, resulting in uncertainty as to their ultimate scope and effect. In particular, the Basel Committee has developed two quantitative measures intended to strengthen liquidity risk management and supervision:    56          a short-term Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and a long-term, structural Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR, which will become a minimum requirement on January 1, 2015, is designed to ensure banking organizations maintain an adequate level of unencumbered cash and high quality unencumbered assets that can be converted into cash to meet liquidity needs. The NSFR, which will become a minimum requirement by January 1, 2018, is designed to promote the medium- and long-term funding of assets and activities over a one-year time horizon. The LCR must be at least 100%, while the NSFR must be greater than 100%.  Citi may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity in light of the liquidity standards proposed by the Basel Committee or other regulators in the U.S. or abroad, or Citi’s costs to maintain such liquidity levels may increase. For example, Citi could be required to increase its long-term funding to meet the NSFR, the cost of which could also be negatively effected by the regulatory requirements aimed at facilitating the orderly resolution of financial institutions. Moreover, Citigroup’s ability to maintain and manage adequate liquidity is dependent upon the continued economic recovery as well as the scope and effect of any other legislative or regulatory developments or requirements relating to or impacting liquidity.  During 2010, consistent with its strategy, Citigroup continued to divest relatively higher yielding assets from Citi Holdings. The desire to maintain adequate liquidity continued to cause Citigroup to invest its available funds in lower-yielding assets, such as those issued by the U.S. government. As a result, during 2010, the yields across both the interest-earning assets and the interest-bearing liabilities continued to remain under pressure. The lower asset yields more than offset the lower cost of funds, resulting in continued low NIM. There can be no assurance that Citigroup’s NIM will not continue to be negatively impacted by these factors.   Citigroup’s ability to utilize its DTAs to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if it experiences an “ownership change” under the Internal Revenue Code. As of December 31, 2010, Citigroup had recognized net DTAs of approximately $52.1 billion, which are included in its tangible common equity. Citigroup’s ability to utilize its DTAs to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if Citigroup experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code). In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in Citigroup’s ownership by “5-percent shareholders” (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period.  A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change DTAs equal to the value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate (subject to certain adjustments), provided that the annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation arising from an ownership change under Section 382 on Citigroup’s ability to utilize its DTAs will depend on the value of Citigroup’s stock at the time of the ownership change. Under IRS Notice 2010-2, Citi did not experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 as a result of the sales of its common stock held by the U.S. Treasury.   The value of Citi’s DTAs could be reduced if corporate tax rates in the U.S., or certain foreign jurisdictions, are decreased. There have been recent discussions in Congress and by the Obama Administration regarding potentially decreasing the U.S. corporate tax rate. In addition, the Japanese government has proposed reductions in the national and local corporate tax rates by 4.5% and 0.9%, respectively, which could be enacted as early as the first or second quarter of 2011. While Citigroup may benefit in some respects from any decreases in these corporate tax rates, any reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate would result in a decrease to the value of Citi’s DTAs, which could be significant. Moreover, if the legislation in Japan is enacted as proposed, it would require Citi to take an approximate $200 million charge in the quarter in which the legislation is so enacted.    The expiration of a provision of the U.S. tax law that allows Citigroup to defer U.S. taxes on certain active financing income could significantly increase Citi’s tax expense. Citigroup’s tax provision has historically been reduced because active financing income earned and indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. is taxed at the lower local tax rate rather than at the higher U.S. tax rate. Such reduction has been dependent upon a provision of the U.S. tax law that defers the imposition of U.S. taxes on certain active financing income until that income is repatriated to the U.S. as a dividend. This “active financing exception” is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2011, and while it has been scheduled to expire on numerous prior occasions and has been extended each time, there can be no assurance that the exception will continue to be extended. In the event this exception is not extended beyond 2011, the U.S. tax imposed on Citi’s active financing income earned outside the U.S. would increase after 2011, which could further result in Citi’s tax expense increasing significantly.   Citigroup may not be able to continue to wind down Citi Holdings at the same pace as it has in the past two years. While Citigroup intends to dispose of or wind down the Citi Holdings businesses as quickly as practicable yet in an economically rational manner, and while Citi made substantial progress towards this goal during 2009 and 2010, Citi may not be able to dispose of or wind down the businesses or assets that are part of Citi Holdings at the same level or pace as in the past two years. BAM primarily consists of the MSSB JV, pursuant to which Morgan Stanley has call rights on Citi’s ownership interest in the venture over a three-year period beginning in 2012. Of the remaining assets in SAP, as of December 31, 2010, approximately one-third are held-to-maturity. In LCL, approximately half of the remaining assets consist of U.S. mortgages as of December 31, 2010, which will run off over time, and larger businesses such as CitiFinancial. As a result, Citi’s ability to simplify its organization may not occur as rapidly as it has in the past. In addition, the ability of Citigroup to continue to reduce its risk-weighted assets or limit its expenses through, among other things, the winding down of Citi Holdings may be adversely affected depending on the ultimate pace or level of Citi Holdings business divestitures, portfolio run-offs and asset sales.    57          Citigroup remains subject to restrictions on its ability to pay common stock dividends and to redeem or repurchase Citigroup equity or trust preferred securities for so long as its trust preferred securities continue to be held by the U.S government. Pursuant to its agreements with certain U.S. government entities, dated June 9, 2009, executed in connection with Citi’s exchange offers consummated in July and September 2009, Citigroup remains subject to dividend and share repurchase restrictions for so long as the U.S. government continues to hold any Citigroup trust preferred securities acquired in connection with the exchange offers. These restrictions, subject to certain exceptions, generally prohibit Citigroup from paying regular cash dividends in excess of $0.01 per share of common stock per quarter or from redeeming or repurchasing any Citigroup equity securities or trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $3.025 billion of trust preferred securities issued to the FDIC remains outstanding (of which approximately $800 million is being held for the benefit of the U.S. Treasury). In addition, even if Citigroup were no longer contractually bound by the dividend and share purchase restrictions of these agreements, any decision by Citigroup to pay common stock dividends or initiate a share repurchase will be subject to further regulatory approval.    Citi could be harmed competitively if it is unable to hire or retain qualified employees as a result of regulatory uncertainty regarding compensation practices or otherwise. Citigroup’s performance and competitive standing is heavily dependent on the talents and efforts of the highly skilled individuals that it is able to attract and retain, including without limitation in its S&B business. Competition for such individuals within the financial services industry has been, and will likely continue to be, intense.  Compensation is a key element of attracting and retaining highly qualified employees. Banking regulators in the U.S., European Union and elsewhere are in the process of developing principles, regulations and other guidance governing what are deemed to be sound compensation practices and policies, and the outcome of these processes is uncertain. In addition, compensation for certain employees of financial institutions, such as bankers, continues to be a legislative focus both in Europe and in the U.S.  Changes required to be made to the compensation policies and practices of Citigroup, or those of the banking industry generally, may hinder Citi’s ability to compete in or manage its businesses effectively, to expand into or maintain its presence in certain businesses and regions, or to remain competitive in offering new financial products and services. This is particularly the case in emerging markets, where Citigroup is often competing for qualified employees with other financial institutions that seek to expand in these markets. Moreover, new disclosure requirements may result from the worldwide regulatory processes described above. If this were to occur, Citi could be required to make additional disclosures relating to the compensation of its employees in a manner that creates competitive harm through the disclosure of previously confidential information, or through the direct or indirect new disclosures of the identity of certain employees and their compensation. Any such additional public disclosure of employee   compensation, or any future legislation or regulation that requires Citigroup to restrict or modify its compensation policies, could hurt Citi’s ability to hire, retain and motivate its key employees and thus harm it competitively.    Citigroup is subject to a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings that are often highly complex, slow to develop and are thus difficult to predict or estimate. At any given time, Citigroup is defending a significant number of legal and regulatory proceedings, and the volume of claims and the amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions generally remain high. Proceedings brought against Citi may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, business improvement orders, or other results adverse to it, which could materially and negatively affect Citigroup’s businesses, financial condition or results of operations, require material changes in Citi’s operations, or cause Citigroup reputational harm. Moreover, the many large claims asserted against Citi are highly complex and slow to develop, and they may involve novel or untested legal theories. The outcome of such proceedings may thus be difficult to predict or estimate until late in the proceedings, which may last several years. Although Citigroup establishes accruals for its litigation and regulatory matters according to accounting requirements, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued.  In addition, while Citi seeks to prevent and detect employee misconduct, such as fraud, employee misconduct is not always possible to deter or prevent, and the extensive precautions Citigroup takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases, which could subject Citi to additional liability. Moreover, the so-called “whistle-blower” provisions of the Financial Reform Act, which apply to all corporations and other entities and persons, provide substantial financial incentives for persons to report alleged violations of law to the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These provisions could increase the number of claims that Citigroup will have to investigate or against which Citigroup will have to defend itself, and may otherwise further increase Citigroup’s legal liabilities.  For additional information relating to Citigroup’s potential exposure relating to legal and regulatory matters, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently reviewing or proposing changes to several key financial accounting and reporting standards utilized by Citi which, if adopted as proposed, could have a material impact on how Citigroup records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The FASB is currently reviewing or proposing changes to several of the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of Citigroup’s financial statements. While the outcome of these reviews and proposed changes is uncertain and difficult to predict, certain of these changes could have a material impact on how Citigroup records and reports its financial condition and results of operations, and could hinder    58          understanding or cause confusion across comparative financial statement periods. For example, the FASB’s financial instruments and balance sheet offsetting projects could, among other things, significantly change how Citigroup classifies, measures and reports financial instruments, determines the impairment on those assets, accounts for hedges, and determines when assets and liabilities may be offset. In addition, the FASB’s leasing project could eliminate most operating leases and instead capitalize them, which would result in a gross-up of Citi’s balance sheet and a change in the timing of income and expense recognition patterns for leases.  Moreover, the FASB continues its convergence project with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) pursuant to which U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are to be converged. The FASB and IASB continue to have significant disagreements on the convergence of certain key standards affecting Citi’s financial reporting, including accounting for financial instruments and hedging. In addition, the SEC has not yet determined whether, or when, U.S. companies will be required to adopt IFRS. There can be no assurance that the transition to IFRS, if and when required to be adopted by Citi, will not have a material impact on how Citi reports its financial results, or that Citi will be able to meet any transition timeline so adopted.    Citigroup’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates, which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future, sometimes significant. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, Citigroup is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation and regulatory exposures, mortgage representation and warranty claims and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If the assumptions or estimates underlying Citigroup’s financial statements are incorrect, Citigroup may experience significant losses. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing Citi’s financial statements, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates” below, and for further information relating to litigation and regulatory exposures, see Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Citigroup may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies, and concentration of risk increases the potential for such losses. Citigroup seeks to monitor and control its risk exposure across businesses, regions and critical products through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. While Citigroup employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Market conditions over the last several years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk.    Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses. Because of concentration of risk, Citigroup may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for Citigroup’s competitors. These concentrations can limit, and have limited, the effectiveness of Citigroup’s hedging strategies and have caused Citigroup to incur significant losses, and they may do so again in the future. In addition, Citigroup extends large commitments as part of its credit origination activities. Citigroup’s inability to reduce its credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market dislocation, could negatively affect its results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans.  Although Citigroup’s activities expose it to the credit risk of many different entities and counterparties, Citigroup routinely executes a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services sector, including banks, other financial institutions, insurance companies, investment banks and government and central banks. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to this sector. To the extent regulatory or market developments lead to an increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges, this could increase Citigroup’s concentration of risk in this sector.   A failure in Citigroup’s operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair its liquidity, disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage Citigroup’s reputation and cause losses. Citigroup’s businesses are highly dependent on their ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services Citigroup provides to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of Citigroup’s client base and its geographical reach, developing and maintaining Citigroup’s operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. Citigroup’s financial, account, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyberattack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect Citigroup’s ability to process these transactions or provide services.  In addition, Citigroup’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its computer systems and networks. Although Citigroup takes protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Citi’s and its clients’ information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavors to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, Citigroup’s computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account    59          takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyberattacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures Citigroup has taken, these threats may come from external actors such as governments, organized crime and hackers, third parties such as outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within Citigroup. Given the high volume of transactions at Citigroup, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified.  Citigroup also faces the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate Citigroup’s business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on or breach of Citigroup’s operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as Citigroup’s interconnectivity with its clients grows, it increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to its clients’ systems.  If one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, Citigroup’s computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in Citi’s, as well as its clients’ or other third parties’, operations, which could result in reputational damage, financial losses, regulatory penalties and/or client dissatisfaction or loss.   Failure to maintain the value of the Citigroup brand could harm Citi’s global competitive advantage and its strategy. Citi’s ability to continue to leverage its extensive global footprint, and thus maintain one of its key competitive advantages, depends on the continued strength and recognition of the Citigroup brand on a global basis, including the emerging markets as other financial institutions grow their operations in these markets and competition intensifies. The Citi name is integral to its businesses as well as to the implementation of its strategy to be a global bank for its clients and customers. Maintaining, promoting and positioning the Citigroup brand will depend largely on the success of its ability to provide consistent, high-quality financial services and products to these clients and customers around the world. Citigroup’s brand could be harmed if its public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity, whether or not true, about Citigroup or the financial services industry in general, or by a negative perception of Citigroup’s short-term or long-term financial prospects. Failure to maintain its brand could hurt Citi’s competitive advantage and its strategy.    60           MANAGING GLOBAL RISK
