Item 1A. Risk Factors    This section provides an overview of the risks that may impact our performance in the future. We have included the results of our sensitivity testing for risks that can be objectively and reliably quantified. The sensitivity testing results represent hypothetical scenarios. While these scenarios do not represent our expectations of future experience, they are intended to illustrate the potential impacts of reasonably possible hypothetical changes in experience. These sensitivities are based on our risk exposures at a point in time and may not be representative of future results.  A decline or increased volatility in the securities markets could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rates of investment, either of which could reduce our net income, revenues and AUM.   Favorable performance by the U.S. and international securities markets increases investments in these markets and benefits our asset management and accumulation businesses and increases our AUM. Because the revenues of our asset management businesses are, to a large extent, based on the value of AUM, a decline in these securities markets would decrease our revenues. Turmoil in these securities markets could lead investors to withdraw from these markets, decrease their rates of investment or refrain from making new investments which may reduce our net income, revenues and AUM. Using assumptions and data in effect as of December 31, 2007, we estimate that an immediate 10% drop in the Standard & Poors index, followed by a 2% per quarter increase, would reduce our annual operating earnings by approximately 4% — 6%.  Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks which may diminish the value of our invested assets and the investment returns credited to customers, which could reduce our sales, revenues, AUM and net income.    An increase in defaults on our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our profitability.    We are subject to the risk that the issuers of the fixed maturity securities we own will default on principal and interest payments, particularly if a major downturn in economic activity occurs. As of December 31, 2007, our U.S. investment operations held $44.5 billion of fixed maturity securities, or 74% of total U.S. invested assets, of which approximately 4.9% were below investment grade, including $48.2 million, or 0.11% of our total fixed maturity securities which we classified as either "problem," "potential problem," or "restructured." See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — U.S. Investment Operations — Fixed Maturity Securities." As of December 31, 2007, the international investment operations of our fully consolidated subsidiaries held $2.7 billion, or 67%, of total international invested assets in fixed maturity securities, of which 19% are government bonds. Some non-government bonds have been rated on the basis of the issuer's country credit rating. However, the ratings relationship between national ratings and global ratings is not linear with the U.S. The starting point for national ratings differs by country, which makes the assessment of credit quality more difficult. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — International Investment Operations." An increase in defaults on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.    An increased rate of delinquency and defaults on our commercial mortgage loans, especially those with balloon payments, could decrease our profitability.    Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio faces both delinquency and default risk. Commercial mortgage loans of $10.8 billion represented 17% of our total invested assets as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, loans that were in the process of foreclosure totaled $13.0 million, or 0.12% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. The performance of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio, however, may fluctuate in the future. An increase in the delinquency rate of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio could harm our financial strength and decrease our profitability.   As of December 31, 2007, approximately $9.1 billion, or 84%, of our commercial mortgage loans before valuation allowance had balloon payment maturities. A balloon maturity is a loan with larger dollar amounts of payments becoming due in the later years of the loan. The default rate on commercial mortgage loans with balloon payment maturities has historically been higher than for commercial mortgage loans with standard repayment schedules. Since most of the principal is being repaid at maturity, the amount of loss on a default is generally greater than on other commercial mortgage loans. An increase in defaults on such loans as a result of the foregoing factors could harm our financial strength and reduce our net income.    We may have difficulty selling our privately placed fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments because they are less liquid than our publicly traded fixed maturity securities.   As of December 31, 2007, our privately placed fixed maturity securities, commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments represented approximately 42% of the value of our invested assets. If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices, in a timely manner, or both.  17        Derivative instruments may not be honored by counterparties resulting in ineffective hedging of our risks.   We use derivative instruments to hedge various risks we face in our businesses. See Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." We enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures, currency swaps, currency forwards, credit default swaps, treasury lock agreements, commodity swaps and options, with a number of counterparties. If, however, our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, we will have failed to effectively hedge the related risk. That failure may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.    Environmental liability exposure may result from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments.   Liability under environmental protection laws resulting from our commercial mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability. Under the laws of several states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of cleanup. In some states, this kind of lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property, which would impair our ability to foreclose on that property should the related loan be in default. In addition, under the laws of some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, we may be liable for costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that require remedy at a property securing a mortgage loan held by us, if our agents or employees have become sufficiently involved in the hazardous waste aspects of the operations of the related obligor on that loan, regardless of whether or not the environmental damage or threat was caused by the obligor. We also may face this liability after foreclosing on a property securing a mortgage loan held by us. This may harm our financial strength and decrease our profitability.    Regional concentration of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio in California may subject us to economic downturns or losses attributable to earthquakes in that state.   Credit extensions in the state of California accounted for 18%, or $1.9 billion, of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2007. Due to this concentration of commercial mortgage loans in California, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of an economic downturn in California as well as to catastrophes, such as earthquakes, that may affect the region. While we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans, we do take into account property specific engineering reports, construction type and geographical concentration by fault lines in our investment underwriting guidelines. If economic conditions in California deteriorate or catastrophes occur, we may experience delinquencies on the portion of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio located in California in the future, which may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.  Competition from companies that may have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance may impair our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and maintain our profitability.  We believe that our ability to compete is based on a number of factors including scale, service, product features, price, investment performance, commission structure, distribution capabilities, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers, insurers and asset managers, many of which have advantages over us in one or more of the above competitive factors.   Each of our segments faces strong competition. The primary competitors for our U.S. Asset Accumulation and Global Asset Management segments are asset managers, banks, broker-dealers and insurers. Our ability to increase and retain AUM is directly related to the performance of our investments as measured against market averages and the performance of our competitors. Even when securities prices are generally rising, performance can be affected by investment styles. Also, there is a risk that we may not be able to attract and retain the top talent needed to compete in our industry.   Competition for our International Asset Management and Accumulation segment comes primarily from local financial services firms and other international companies operating on a stand-alone basis or in partnership with local firms. Our Life and Health Insurance segment competes with insurers and health maintenance organizations.   National banks, with their large existing customer bases, may increasingly compete with insurers as a result of court rulings allowing national banks to sell annuity products in some circumstances, and as a result of legislation removing restrictions on bank affiliations with insurers. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 permits mergers that combine commercial banks, insurers and securities firms under one holding company. These developments may increase competition, in particular for our asset management and accumulation businesses, by substantially increasing the number, size and financial strength of potential competitors who may be able to offer, due to economies of scale, more competitive pricing than we can.  18      A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, reduce new sales and terminate relationships with distributors, impact existing liabilities and increase our cost of capital, any of which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.  Ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. A rating downgrade, or the potential for such a downgrade, could, among other things:    •materially increase the number of policy or contract surrenders for all or a portion of their net cash values and withdrawals by policyholders of cash values from their policies or with respect to general account guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements purchased by pension plans and other institutions; •result in the termination of our relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents, wholesalers and other distributors of our products and services; •reduce new sales, particularly with respect to general account guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements purchased by pension plans and other institutions; •cause some of our existing liabilities to be subject to acceleration, additional collateral support, changes in terms, or creation of additional financial obligations; and •increase our cost of capital and limit our access to the capital markets.    Any of these consequences could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.  Unforeseen increases in cash outflows may negatively impact our liquidity.   We maintain a level of cash and securities which, combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations, is believed adequate to meet anticipated short-term and long-term benefit and expense payment obligations. However, withdrawal and surrender levels may differ from anticipated levels for a variety of reasons, such as changes in the interest rate environment or changes in our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings. For example, a significant increase in interest rates may cause our policyholders to withdraw the cash values of their policies in order to seek more attractive returns elsewhere. A downgrade in our financial strength ratings could also cause an increase in policyholder withdrawals. If policyholder withdrawals significantly exceed our expectations, we may be forced to borrow funds or liquidate investments to raise the funds necessary to fund the withdrawals. Liquidations may result in capital losses, particularly in periods of volatile interest rates. Because volatile interest rates often make it more difficult to sell certain fixed income securities, there is also a risk that we will find it difficult to raise the cash necessary to fund a very large amount of withdrawal activity.   Certain aspects of our businesses help us mitigate potential liquidity risk:    •Our liability portfolio is diverse. Many of our products have fairly predictable cash demands, and where cash demands are less predictable, we have the ability to defer or spread out the cash payments. Importantly, our products have features to discourage surrenders. •Our asset portfolio is also diverse and spread over many different types of exposures (asset class, credit, geography, industry, etc.).     For further discussion on liquidity risk management, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources."  Our efforts to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our profitability and retained earnings may not be effective.  We attempt to significantly reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the profitability and retained earnings of our asset accumulation and life and health insurance operations. We accomplish this reduction primarily by managing the duration of our assets relative to the duration of our liabilities. During a period of rising interest rates, policy surrenders, withdrawals and requests for policy loans may increase as customers seek to achieve higher returns. Despite our efforts to reduce the impact of rising interest rates, we may be required to sell assets to raise the cash necessary to respond to such surrenders, withdrawals and loans, thereby realizing capital losses on the assets sold. An increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals may also require us to accelerate amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ("DPAC") relating to these contracts, which would further reduce our profitability.   During periods of declining interest rates, borrowers may prepay or redeem mortgages and bonds that we own, which would force us to reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates. For some of our products, such as guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements, we are unable to lower the rate we credit to customers in response to the lower return we will earn on our investments. In addition, it may be more difficult for us to maintain our desired spread between the investment income we earn and the interest we credit to our customers during periods of declining interest rates, thereby reducing our profitability.  19       We estimate that an immediate interest rate decrease of 100 basis points would reduce our operating earnings by less than 1% over the next year. However, if the lower interest rate level continues, the net impact could grow over time, as our existing investments mature and the proceeds are reinvested in lower yielding assets. Total cumulative operating earnings over the next 5 years could be reduced by approximately 1% per year if interest rates were to remain at the lower levels.   For further discussion on interest rate risk management, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Interest Rate Risk".  If we are unable to attract and retain sales representatives and develop new distribution sources, sales of our products and services may be reduced.  We distribute our asset accumulation, asset management and life, health and specialty benefit insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels, including our own internal sales representatives, independent brokers, banks, broker-dealers and other third-party marketing organizations. We must attract and retain sales representatives to sell our products. Strong competition exists among financial services companies for efficient sales representatives. We compete with other financial services companies for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our financial position, support services and compensation and product features. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient sales representatives to sell our products, our ability to compete and revenues from new sales would suffer.  Our international businesses face political, legal, operational and other risks that could reduce our profitability in those businesses.  Our international businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision from central and/or local governmental authorities in each country in which we operate. New interpretations of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations may harm our international businesses and reduce our profitability in those businesses.   Our international businesses face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in our operations in the U.S. We face the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some of our international businesses are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging or potentially volatile markets. In addition, we rely on local staff, including local sales forces, in these countries where there is a risk that we may encounter labor problems with local staff, especially in countries where workers' associations and trade unions are strong. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in that country.  We may face losses if our actual experience differs significantly from our pricing and reserving assumptions.  Our profitability depends significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used in setting prices for our products and establishing liabilities for future insurance and annuity policy benefits and claims. The premiums that we charge and the liabilities that we hold for future policy benefits are based on assumptions concerning a number of factors, including the amount of premiums that we will receive in the future, rate of return on assets we purchase with premiums received, expected claims, mortality, morbidity, expenses and persistency, which is the measurement of the percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year, as measured by premiums. However, due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of the liabilities for unpaid policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts we will ultimately pay to settle these liabilities. As a result, we may experience volatility in the level of our profitability and our reserves from period to period, particularly for our health and disability insurance products. To the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than our underlying assumptions, we could be required to increase our liabilities, which may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability.   For example, if mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions, we will be required to make greater claims payments on our life insurance policies than we had projected. However, this risk is partially offset by our payout annuity business, where an increase in mortality rates will result in a decrease in benefit payments. We estimate that an immediate and sustained 5% increase in all mortality rates above what we are expecting would reduce total company operating earnings by less than 1% over the next year.   Our earnings may also be adversely impacted by an increase in morbidity rates. We estimate that an increase of 5 percentage points in our medical loss ratios above what we are expecting would reduce total company operating earnings by approximately 5-7% over the next year, and an increase of 5 percentage points in our dental, vision and disability loss ratios above what we are expecting would reduce total company operating earnings by approximately 3-4% over the next year.   For additional information on our insurance reserves, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Insurance Reserves."  20      Our ability to pay stockholder dividends and meet our obligations may be constrained by the limitations on dividends Iowa insurance laws impose on Principal Life.  We are an insurance holding company whose assets include all of the outstanding shares of the common stock of Principal Life and other direct subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and any debt service, depends upon the receipt of dividends from Principal Life. Iowa insurance laws impose limitations on the ability of Principal Life to pay dividends to us. Any inability of Principal Life to pay dividends to us in the future may cause us to be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders and meet our other obligations. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a discussion of regulatory restrictions on Principal Life's ability to pay us dividends.  The pattern of amortizing our DPAC and other actuarial balances on our investment contract, participating life insurance and universal life-type products may change, impacting both the level of the asset and the timing of our net income.  Amortization of the DPAC asset depends on the actual and expected profits generated by the lines of business that incurred the expenses. Expected profits are dependent on assumptions regarding a number of factors including investment returns, benefit payments, expenses, mortality and policy lapse. Due to the uncertainty associated with establishing these assumptions, we cannot, with precision, determine the exact pattern of profit emergence. As a result, amortization of DPAC will vary from period to period. To the extent that actual experience emerges less favorably than expected, or our expectation for future profits decreases, the DPAC asset may be reduced, reducing our profitability in the current period.   For additional information, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Other Actuarial Balances."  We may need to fund deficiencies in our Closed Block assets.   In connection with its conversion in 1998 into a stock life insurance company, Principal Life established an accounting mechanism, known as a "Closed Block" for the benefit of participating ordinary life insurance policies that had a dividend scale in force on July 1, 1998. Dividend scales are the actuarial formulas used by life insurance companies to determine amounts payable as dividends on participating policies based on experience factors relating to, among other things, investment results, mortality, lapse rates, expenses, premium taxes and policy loan interest and utilization rates. The Closed Block was designed to provide reasonable assurance to policyholders included in the Closed Block that, after the conversion, assets would be available to maintain the aggregate dividend scales in effect for 1997 if the experience underlying such scales were to continue.   We allocated assets to the Closed Block as of July 1, 1998 in an amount such that we expect their cash flows, together with anticipated revenues from the policies in the Closed Block, to be sufficient to support the Closed Block business, including payment of claims, expenses, charges and taxes and to provide for the continuation of aggregate dividend scales in accordance with the 1997 policy dividend scales if the experience underlying such scales continues, and to allow for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. We bear the costs of expenses associated with Closed Block policies and, accordingly, these costs were not funded as part of the assets allocated to the Closed Block. Any increase in such costs in the future will be borne by us. As of December 31, 2007, Closed Block assets and liabilities were $4,806.5 million and $5,811.0 million, respectively.   We will continue to pay guaranteed benefits under the policies included in the Closed Block, in accordance with their terms. The Closed Block assets, cash flows generated by the Closed Block assets and anticipated revenues from polices included in the Closed Block may not be sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these policies. If they are not sufficient, we must fund the shortfall. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose for business reasons to support dividend payments on policies in the Closed Block with our general account funds.   The Closed Block assets, cash flows generated by the Closed Block assets and anticipated revenues from policies in the Closed Block will benefit only the holders of those policies. In addition, to the extent that these amounts are greater than the amounts estimated at the time we funded the Closed Block, dividends payable in respect of the policies included in the Closed Block may be greater than they would have been in the absence of a Closed Block. Any excess earnings will be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders but will not be available to our stockholders.  A pandemic, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could adversely affect our net income.  Our mortality and morbidity experience could be adversely impacted by a catastrophic event. In addition, a severe catastrophic event may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. The resulting macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows, as well as the value and liquidity of our invested assets. We may also experience operational disruptions if our employees are unable or unwilling  21       to come to work due to a pandemic or other catastrophe. We have developed extensive contingency plans to minimize the risk of operational disruptions. In addition, our use of reinsurance reduces our exposure to adverse mortality experience. Despite these measures, we may still be exposed to losses in the event of a pandemic, terrorist attack, or other catastrophe.  Our reinsurers could default on their obligations or increase their rates, which could adversely impact our net income and profitability.  We cede material amounts of insurance to other insurance companies through reinsurance. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies." However, we remain liable to the policyholder, even if the reinsurer defaults on its obligations with respect to the ceded business. If a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations, we will be forced to cover the claims on the reinsured policies. In addition, a reinsurer insolvency may cause us to lose our reserve credits on the ceded business, in which case we would be required to establish additional reserves.   The premium rates that we charge are based, in part, on the assumption that reinsurance will be available at a certain cost. Some of our reinsurance contracts contain provisions which limit the reinsurer's ability to increase rates on in-force business; however, some do not. If a reinsurer raises the rates that it charges on a block of in-force business, our profitability may be negatively impacted if we are not able to pass the increased costs on to the customer. If reinsurers raise the rates that they charge on new business, we may be forced to raise the premiums that we charge, which could have a negative impact on our competitive position.   To mitigate the risks associated with the use of reinsurance, we carefully select our reinsurers, and we monitor their ratings and financial condition on a regular basis. We also spread our business among several reinsurers, in order to diversify our risk exposure.  We face risks arising from acquisitions of businesses.   We have engaged in acquisitions of businesses in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future. We face a number of risks arising from acquisition transactions, including difficulties in integrating the acquired business into our operations, difficulties in assimilating and retaining employees and intermediaries, difficulties in retaining the existing customers of the acquired entity, and unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection with the acquired business. These risks may prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from acquisitions.  Changes in laws, regulations or accounting standards may reduce our profitability.   Changes in regulations may reduce our profitability.    Our insurance business is subject to comprehensive state regulation and supervision throughout the U.S and in the international markets in which we operate. We are also impacted by federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulations and federal taxation. The primary purpose of state regulation of the insurance business is to protect policyholders, not stockholders. The laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers to regulate such matters as:    •licensing companies to transact business, •licensing agents, •admitting statutory assets, •mandating a number of insurance benefits, •regulating premium rates, •approving policy forms, •regulating unfair trade and claims practices, •establishing statutory reserve requirements and solvency standards, •fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum rates for accumulation of surrender values, •restricting various transactions between affiliates, and •regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.    State insurance regulators, federal regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") continually reexamine existing laws and regulations, and may impose changes in the future.  22       Federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation, financial services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our profitability. For example, Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation relating to changes in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to permit application of state law remedies, such as consequential and punitive damages, in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits, which, if adopted, could increase our liability for damages in future litigation. Additionally, new interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously. In addition, reductions in contribution levels to defined contribution plans may decrease our profitability.    Changes in tax laws could increase our tax costs and reduce sales of our insurance, annuity and investment products.   Current federal income tax laws generally permit the tax-deferred accumulation of earnings on the premiums paid by the holders of annuities and life insurance products. Taxes, if any, are payable on income attributable to a distribution under the contract for the year in which the distribution is made. Congress has, from time to time, considered legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of such deferral of taxation on the accretion of value within life insurance and non-qualified annuity contracts. Enactment of this legislation, including a simplified "flat tax" income structure with an exemption from taxation for investment income, could result in fewer sales of our insurance, annuity and investment products.   From time to time, Congress, as well as foreign, state and local governments, considers legislation that could increase our tax costs. If such legislation is adopted, our profitability could be negatively impacted.    Repeal or modification of the federal estate tax could reduce our revenues.    The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (the "Act") amended the federal estate tax laws by increasing the amount of the unified credit beginning in 2002, thereby increasing the amount of property not subject to the estate tax. The Act also gradually reduces the federal estate tax rate over a period of years beginning in 2002, and repeals the tax entirely in 2010. The law in effect prior to the Act, however, is reinstated for years after 2010. Through the year ended December 31, 2007, we received recurring premium of $51.0 million for survivorship life insurance policies we have sold. A significant number of these policies were purchased for the purpose of providing cash to pay federal estate taxes. The reduction of the federal estate tax and temporary repeal could result in policyholders reducing coverage under, or surrendering, these policies.    Changes in federal, state and foreign securities laws may reduce our profitability.   Our asset management and accumulation and life insurance businesses are subject to various levels of regulation under federal, state and foreign securities laws. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory or brokerage clients and generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. Changes to these laws or regulations that restrict the conduct of our business could reduce our profitability.    Changes in accounting standards may reduce our profitability.    Accounting standards are subject to change and can negatively impact our profitability. See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies." In addition to recently issued accounting guidance, the standard setters have a full agenda of topics they plan to review, any of which have the potential to negatively impact our profitability. The results for past accounting periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future accounting period.  A computer system failure or security breach could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.  We rely on computer systems to conduct business, including customer service, marketing and sales activities, customer relationship management and producing financial statements. While we have policies, procedures, automation and backup plans designed to prevent or limit the effect of failure, our computer systems may be vulnerable to disruptions or breaches as the result of natural disasters, man-made disasters, criminal activity, pandemics, or other events beyond our control. The failure of our computer systems for any reason could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of customer business and adversely impact our profitability.   We retain confidential information on our computer systems, including customer information and proprietary business information. Any compromise of the security of our computer systems that results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation, expose us to litigation, increase regulatory scrutiny and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.  23      Results of litigation and regulatory investigations may affect our financial strength or reduce our profitability.  We are a plaintiff or defendant in actions arising out of our insurance businesses and investment operations. We are, from time to time, also involved in various governmental, regulatory and administrative proceedings and inquiries. These factors may affect our financial strength or reduce our profitability. For further discussion on litigation and regulatory investigation risk, see Item 3. "Legal Proceedings."  Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our profitability.   Principal International generally writes policies denominated in various local currencies and invests the premiums and deposits in local currencies. Although investing in local currencies limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation of these results into our consolidated financial statements. For further discussion on foreign currency exchange risk, see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Foreign Currency Risk."  Applicable laws and our stockholder rights plan, certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests.  State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, defer, prevent, or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.   State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment, which may delay, defer or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.   The following provisions, included in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, may also have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. In particular, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws:    •permit our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; •divide our Board of Directors into three classes; •limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors; •prohibit stockholders from filling vacancies on our Board of Directors; •prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders; •impose advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at stockholder meetings; and •require the approval by the holders of at least 75% of our outstanding common stock for the amendment of our by-laws and provisions of our certificate of incorporation governing:   •the classified board, •the director's discretion in determining what he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of Principal Financial Group, Inc., •the liability of directors and •the elimination of the prohibition on stockholder actions by written consent.     In addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware may limit the ability of an "interested stockholder" to engage in business combinations with us. An interested stockholder is defined to include persons owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.   Our stockholder rights plan may have anti-takeover effects. The stockholder rights plan is designed to protect our stockholders in the event of unsolicited offers to acquire us and other coercive takeover tactics, which, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, could impair the board's ability to represent stockholder interests. Our stockholder rights plan might render an unsolicited takeover more difficult or less likely to occur, even though such a takeover might offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price and may be favored by our stockholders.  24             Our financial results may be adversely impacted by global climate changes.   Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution, resulting in a gradual increase in global average temperatures and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. These trends are expected to continue in the future, and have the potential to impact nearly all sectors of the economy to varying degrees. Our initial research indicates that climate change does not pose an imminent or significant threat to our operations or business, but we will continue to monitor new developments in the future.   Potential impacts may include the following:    •Changes in temperatures and air quality may adversely impact our mortality and morbidity rates. For example, increases in the level of pollution and airborne allergens may cause an increase in upper respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, leading to increased claims in our life, health and disability income business. However, the risk of increased mortality on our life insurance business is partly offset by our payout annuity business, where an increase in mortality results in a decrease in benefit payments. •Climate change may impact asset prices, as well as general economic conditions. For example, rising sea levels may lead to decreases in real estate values in coastal areas. Additionally, government policies to slow climate change (e.g., setting limits on carbon emissions) may have an adverse impact on sectors such as utilities, transportation and manufacturing. Changes in asset prices may impact the value of our fixed income, real estate and commercial mortgage investments. We manage our investment risks by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, both geographically and by sector. We also monitor our investments on an on-going basis, allowing us to adjust our exposure to sectors and/or geographical areas that face severe risks due to climate change. •A natural disaster that affects one of our office locations could disrupt our operations and pose a threat to the safety of our employees. However, we have extensive Disaster Recovery programs in place to help mitigate this risk.       Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
