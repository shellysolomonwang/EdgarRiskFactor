ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    You should carefully consider the following risks. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions may adversely affect our business and profitability.    Some of our businesses and our results of operations were materially adversely affected by adverse conditions in the global financial markets and adverse economic conditions generally that began in the second half of 2007. While conditions in the global financial markets have improved, with favorable results for many of our businesses, our businesses, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected, possibly materially, if these conditions recur.    Even under relatively favorable market conditions, our insurance and annuities products and certain of our investment products, as well as our investment returns and our access to and cost of financing, are sensitive to fixed income, equity, real estate and other market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions. These fluctuations and conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity, including in the following respects:        •    The profitability of many of our insurance and annuities products depends in part on the value of the separate accounts supporting these products, which fluctuate substantially depending on the foregoing conditions.        •    Market conditions resulting in reductions in the value of assets we manage or lower transaction volume have an adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of our asset management services, which depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management or transaction volume, and could further decrease the value of our proprietary investments.        •    A change in market conditions, including prolonged periods of high inflation, could cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and persistency of our long-term savings and protection products. A prolonged period of low interest rates could cause persistency of these products to vary from that anticipated and adversely affect profitability (as further described below). Similarly, changing economic conditions and unfavorable public perception of financial institutions can influence customer behavior, including but not limited to increasing claims or surrenders in certain product lines.        •    Sales of our investment-based and asset management products and services may decline, and lapses and surrenders of variable life and annuity products and withdrawals of assets from other investment products may increase if a market downturn, increased market volatility or other market conditions result in customers becoming dissatisfied with their investments or products.        •    A market decline could further result in guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current account values or our pricing assumptions would support, requiring us to materially increase reserves for such products, and may cause customers to retain contracts in force in order to benefit from the guarantees, thereby increasing their cost to us. Any increased cost may or may not be more than offset by the favorable impact of greater persistency from prolonged fee streams. Our valuation of the liabilities for the minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products requires us to consider the market perception of our risk of non-performance, and a    48    Table of Contents       decrease in our own credit spreads resulting from ratings upgrades or other events or market conditions could cause the recorded value of these liabilities to increase, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.        •    Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms which could adversely affect the profitability of future business or our willingness to write future business.        •    Hedging instruments we hold to manage foreign exchange, product, and other risks might not perform as intended or expected resulting in higher realized losses and unforeseen cash needs. Market conditions can limit availability of hedging instruments and also further increase the cost of executing product related hedges and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. Our hedging strategies rely on the performance of counterparties to such hedges. These counterparties may fail to perform for various reasons resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on uncollateralized positions.        •    We have significant investment and derivative portfolios, including but not limited to corporate and asset-backed securities, equities and commercial real estate. Economic conditions as well as adverse capital market conditions, including but not limited to a lack of buyers in the marketplace, volatility, credit spread changes, benchmark interest rate changes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and declines in value of underlying collateral will impact the credit quality, liquidity and value of our investments and derivatives, potentially resulting in higher capital charges and unrealized or realized losses, the latter especially if we were to need to sell a significant amount of investments under such conditions. For example, a widening of credit spreads increases the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and may ultimately result in increased realized losses. Values of our investments and derivatives can also be impacted by reductions in price transparency, changes in assumptions or inputs we use in estimating fair value and changes in investor confidence and preferences, potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses. Volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. Valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, and in certain cases under U.S. GAAP such period to period changes in the value of investments are not recognized in our results of operations or consolidated statements of financial condition.        •    Opportunities for investment of available funds at appropriate returns may be limited, including due to the current low interest rate environment, a diminished securitization market or other factors, with a possible negative impact on our overall results. The consequences of holding cash for long periods of time may result in increased purchase of derivatives for duration management purposes. The increased use of derivatives may increase the volatility of our U.S. GAAP results and our statutory capital.        •    Regardless of market conditions, certain investments we hold, including private bonds and commercial mortgages, are relatively illiquid. If we needed to sell these investments, we may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner at a price that we could otherwise realize.        •    Fluctuations in our operating results and the impact on our investment portfolio may impact the Company’s tax profile and its ability to optimally utilize tax attributes.    Adverse capital market conditions have in the past, and could in the future, significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital, including capital that may be required by our subsidiaries. Under such conditions, we may seek additional debt or equity capital but be unable to obtain such.    Adverse capital market conditions have affected and may affect in the future the availability and cost of borrowed funds and could impact our ability to refinance existing borrowings, thereby ultimately impacting our profitability and ability to support or grow our businesses. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock and replace certain maturing debt obligations. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail certain of our operations, and our business could suffer. The principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums, annuity considerations, deposit funds and cash flow    49    Table of Contents  from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including securities lending and repurchase agreements, commercial paper, medium and long-term debt and capital securities.    Disruptions, uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets limited and, to the extent they persist or recur, may limit in the future our access to capital required to operate our business, most significantly our insurance and annuities operations. These market conditions may in the future limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing debt obligations and access the capital necessary to grow our business, replace capital withdrawn by customers or raise new capital required by our subsidiaries as a result of volatility in the markets. As a result, under such conditions we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter tenor securities than would be optimal, bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Actions we might take to access financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. Our ability to borrow under our commercial paper programs is also dependent upon market conditions. Future deterioration of our capital position at a time when we are unable to access the long-term debt or commercial paper markets could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient.    We may seek additional debt or equity financing to satisfy our needs. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. We may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Further, any future equity offerings would dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.    The Risk Based Capital, or RBC, ratio is a primary measure by which we and state insurance regulators evaluate the capital adequacy of Prudential Insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries, which includes businesses in both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. We manage Prudential Insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries’ RBC ratios to a level consistent with their ratings objectives; however, rating agencies take into account a variety of factors in assigning ratings to our insurance subsidiaries in addition to RBC levels. RBC is determined by statutory rules that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with Prudential Insurance’s products, interest rate risks and general business risks. The RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of Prudential Insurance’s statutory capitalization. Adverse financial performance in the Closed Block Business in Prudential Insurance, including adverse investment performance, will adversely affect Prudential Insurance’s RBC ratios, although dividends to Closed Block policyholders may be subsequently adjusted to reflect such performance. The failure of Prudential Insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries to meet applicable RBC requirements or minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements could subject those subsidiaries to further examination or corrective action by state insurance regulators. The failure to maintain the RBC ratios of Prudential Insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries at desired levels could also adversely impact our competitive position. In addition, RBC ratios may impact our credit and claims paying ratings. Our international insurance companies are subject to conceptually similar measures of capital adequacy, including solvency margins for our Japanese insurance companies, and we face similar risks as those described for our domestic companies in the event that we are unable to maintain these measures at adequate levels. U.S. and international insurance regulators may change capital requirements, as described herein.    Disruptions in the capital markets could adversely affect Prudential Financial’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, as well as threaten to reduce our capital below a level that is consistent with our existing ratings objectives. Therefore, we may need to take actions, which may include but are not limited to: (1) further access external sources of capital, including the debt or equity markets; (2) reduce or eliminate future shareholder dividends on our Common Stock; (3) undertake additional capital management activities, including reinsurance transactions; (4) limit or curtail sales of certain products and/or restructure existing products; (5) undertake further asset sales or internal asset transfers; (6) seek temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules; and (7) maintain greater levels of cash balances or for longer periods thereby reducing investment returns. Certain of these actions may require regulatory approval and/or agreement of counterparties which are outside of our control or have economic costs associated with them.    50    Table of Contents Our asset management operations include real estate held in Prudential Insurance separate accounts, for the benefit of clients, which enter into forward commitments which typically are funded from separate account assets and cash flows and related separate account funding sources. Adverse credit and real estate capital market conditions affecting fund liquidity and the availability of funding could produce challenges in funding commitments in the normal course. In such cases, Prudential Insurance might be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions, which could affect the availability of liquidity for other purposes.    An inability to access our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    We maintain committed unsecured revolving credit facilities that, as of December 31, 2010, totaled $4.108 billion. We rely on these credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity which could be critical in enabling us to meet our obligations as they come due, particularly during periods when alternative sources of liquidity are limited. Our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on our satisfaction of covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, such as Prudential Insurance’s maintenance of a prescribed minimum level of total adjusted capital based on statutory accounting principles under New Jersey law and Prudential Financial’s maintenance of a prescribed minimum level of consolidated net worth calculated in accordance with the applicable credit agreement. Our failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the credit facilities would restrict our access to the facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    We have experienced and may experience additional downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings. A downgrade or potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered, increase our borrowing costs and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, trading counterparties or reinsurers and restrict our access to alternative sources of liquidity.    Financial strength ratings, which are sometimes referred to as “claims-paying” ratings, represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy, and are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products, including Prudential Insurance and our other insurance company subsidiaries. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness, and Prudential Financial’s credit ratings are important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing. A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could potentially, among other things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of credit, cause additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements, and/or hurt our relationships with creditors, distributors, reinsurers or trading counterparties thereby potentially negatively affecting our profitability, liquidity and/or capital. In addition, we consider our own risk of non-performance in determining the fair value of our liabilities, including insurance liabilities that are classified as embedded derivatives under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, changes in our credit or financial strength ratings may affect the fair value of our liabilities. For a description of material rating actions that have occurred from the beginning of 2010 through the date of this filing, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Ratings.”    Prudential Insurance has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY, since June 2008. Membership allows Prudential Insurance access to FHLBNY’s financial services, including the ability to obtain collateralized loans, and to issue collateralized funding agreements that can be used as an alternative source of liquidity. Under FHLBNY guidelines, if Prudential Insurance’s financial strength ratings decline below A/A2/A Stable by S&P, Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, and the FHLBNY does not receive written assurances from the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance regarding Prudential Insurance’s solvency, new borrowings from the FHLBNY would be limited to a term of 90 days or less. Although Prudential Insurance’s ratings are currently at or above the required minimum levels, there can be no assurance that the ratings will remain at these levels in the future.    51    Table of Contents We cannot predict what additional actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any rating agency.    In addition, agreements in connection with capital management activities for our universal life insurance products would require us to post cash collateral based on tests that consider the level of 10-year credit default swap spreads on Prudential Financial’s senior debt. As of December 31, 2010, no collateral amounts were required to be paid.    Ratings downgrades and changes in credit spreads may require us to post collateral, thereby affecting our liquidity, and we may be unable to effectively implement certain capital management activities as a result, or for other reasons.    A downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of Prudential Financial or its rated subsidiaries could result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, including derivative agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. A ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels at December 31, 2010 (relating to financial strength ratings in certain cases and credit ratings in other cases) would result in estimated collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately $198 million as of December 31, 2010. In addition, a ratings downgrade by A.M. Best to “A-” for our domestic life insurance companies would require Prudential Insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $1.7 billion, based on the level of statutory reserves related to the variable annuity business acquired from Allstate, that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately $14 million, or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust.    Interest rate fluctuations or prolonged periods of low interest rates could adversely affect our businesses and profitability and require us to increase reserves and statutory capital.    Our insurance and annuities products and certain of our investment products, and our investment returns, are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and changes in interest rates could adversely affect our investment returns and results of operations, including in the following respects:        •    Some of our products expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts. When interest rates decline, we have to reinvest the cash income from our investments in lower yielding instruments, potentially reducing net investment income. Since many of our policies and contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates or limit the resetting of interest rates, the spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. When interest rates rise, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account as quickly with the higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep these products and contracts competitive.        •    Changes in interest rates can also result in potential losses in our investment activities in which we borrow funds and purchase investments to earn additional spread income on the borrowed funds.        •    When interest rates rise, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns, requiring us to sell investment assets potentially resulting in realized investment losses, or requiring us to accelerate the amortization of DAC, DSI or VOBA (each defined below). In addition, increasing interest rates could cause capital strain for Japanese statutory reporting because the carrying value of bonds classified as available for sale would decline while the value of liabilities would generally remain unchanged.        •    A decline in interest rates accompanied by unexpected prepayments of certain investments could result in reduced investments and a decline in our profitability. An increase in interest rates accompanied by unexpected extensions of certain lower yielding investments could result in a decline in our profitability.        •    Changes in the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of some of our products.    52    Table of Contents     •    Changes in interest rates could increase our costs of financing.        •    Our mitigation efforts with respect to interest rate risk are primarily focused on maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. However, our estimate of the liability cash flow profile may turn out to be inaccurate. In addition, there are practical and capital market limitations on our ability to accomplish this matching, especially in some of our Asian operations. Due to these and other factors we may need to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to satisfy liabilities or be forced to reinvest funds in a lower rate environment. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate, and we may sometimes choose based on economic considerations and other factors not to fully mitigate, the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities.        •    For certain of our products, a delay between the time we make changes in interest rate and other assumptions used for product pricing and the time we are able to reflect these assumptions in products available for sale could negatively impact the long-term profitability of products sold during the intervening period.    Recent periods have been characterized by low interest rates. A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated may result in greater costs associated with certain of our product features which guarantee death benefits or income streams for stated periods or for life; higher costs for derivative instruments used to hedge certain of our product risks; or shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting policy obligations, each of which may require us to record charges to increase reserves. In addition to compressing spreads and reducing net investment income, such an environment may cause policies to remain in force for longer periods than we anticipated in our pricing, potentially resulting in greater claims costs than we expected and resulting in lower overall returns on business in force. In addition, certain statutory capital requirements are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates, and a prolonged period of low interest rates may increase the statutory capital we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves.    Our ability to pay shareholder dividends, to engage in share repurchases and to meet obligations may be adversely affected by limitations imposed on inter-affiliate distributions and transfers by Prudential Insurance and our other subsidiaries.    Prudential Financial is the holding company for all our operations, and dividends, returns of capital and interest income from its subsidiaries are the principal source of funds available to Prudential Financial to pay shareholder dividends, to make share repurchases and to meet its other obligations. These sources of funds may be complemented by Prudential Financial’s access, if available, to the financial markets and bank facilities. As described under “Business—Regulation” and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” our domestic and foreign insurance and various other subsidiary companies, including Prudential Insurance, are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial. In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial distress and under other circumstances. Finally, our management of Prudential Insurance and other subsidiaries to have capitalization consistent with their ratings objectives itself may constrain their payment of dividends. These restrictions on Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries may limit or prevent such subsidiaries from making dividend payments to Prudential Financial in an amount sufficient to fund Prudential Financial’s cash requirements and shareholder dividends. From time to time, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, and various state and foreign insurance regulators have considered, and may in the future consider, proposals to further limit dividend payments that an insurance company may make without regulatory approval.    Difficult market conditions could also affect our ability to pay shareholder dividends. Our practice is to declare and pay dividends annually and the decision concerning Common Stock dividends is ordinarily made in the fourth quarter of the year.    53    Table of Contents Losses due to defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities or reinsurance, bond insurers and derivative instrument counterparties, downgrades in the ratings of securities we hold or of bond insurers, insolvencies of insurers in jurisdictions where we write business and other factors affecting our counterparties or the value of their securities could adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of amounts contractually owed to us, result in assessments or additional statutory capital requirements or reduce our profitability or sources of liquidity.    Issuers and borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, vendors, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors, including bond insurers, may default on their obligations to us or be unable to perform service functions that are significant to our business due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. Such defaults, instances of which have occurred in recent periods, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A downgrade in the ratings of bond insurers could also result in declines in the value of our fixed maturity investments supported by guarantees from bond insurers.    In addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various risks, including certain guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products. We enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. Amounts that we expect to collect under current and future contracts, including, but not limited to reinsurance contracts, are subject to counterparty risk. Our obligations under our products are not changed by our hedging activities and we are liable for our obligations even if our derivative counterparties, including reinsurers, do not pay us. This is a more pronounced risk to us in view of the recent stresses suffered by financial institutions. Such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    Under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, we are subject to assessments, based on the share of business we write in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants.    We use reinsurance as part of our capital management with respect to our Closed Block Business. Ratings downgrades or financial difficulties of reinsurers may require us to utilize additional capital with respect to the business.    The eligible collateral that Prudential Insurance is required to pledge to the FHLBNY in support of its borrowings includes qualifying mortgage-related assets, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities. The major rating agencies have downgraded the credit ratings of certain commercial mortgage-backed securities and may continue to do so. If future downgrades affect the commercial mortgage-backed securities pledged by Prudential Insurance to the FHLBNY, those securities would no longer constitute eligible collateral under FHLBNY guidelines. This could require Prudential Insurance to repay outstanding borrowings or to pledge replacement collateral to the FHLBNY, which could materially reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity from the FHLBNY and/or prevent use of that replacement collateral for asset-based financing transactions.    Guarantees within certain of our products that protect policyholders may decrease our earnings or increase the volatility of our results of operations or financial position under U.S. GAAP if our hedging or risk management strategies prove ineffective or insufficient.    Certain of our products, including especially our variable annuity products, include guarantees of income streams for stated periods or for life. Downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, or (as discussed above) reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the valuation of liabilities associated with such products, resulting in increases in reserves and reductions in net income. We use a variety of hedging and risk management strategies, including product features, to mitigate these risks in part. These strategies may, however, not be fully effective. We may also choose not to fully hedge these risks. Hedging instruments may not effectively offset the costs of guarantees or may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. Hedging instruments also may not change in value correspondingly with associated liabilities due to equity market or interest rate conditions or other reasons. We sometimes choose to hedge these risks on a basis that does not correspond to their anticipated or actual impact upon our results of operations or financial position under U.S. GAAP. For example, as discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and    54    Table of Contents  Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities,” during the third quarter of 2010 we have begun to hedge certain risks associated with our variable annuity products on a basis that does not fully correspond to the associated U.S. GAAP liability. Changes from period to period in the valuation of these policy benefits, and in the amount of our obligations effectively hedged, will result in volatility in our results of operations and financial position under U.S. GAAP. Estimates and assumptions we make in connection with hedging activities may fail to reflect or correspond to our actual long-term exposure in respect of our guarantees. Further, the risk of increases in the costs of our guarantees not covered by our hedging and other capital and risk management strategies may become more significant due to changes in policyholder behavior driven by market conditions or other factors. The above factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.    Our profitability may decline if mortality rates, morbidity rates or persistency rates differ significantly from our pricing expectations.    We set prices for many of our insurance and annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns, using assumptions for mortality rates, or likelihood of death, and morbidity rates, or likelihood of sickness, of our policyholders. In addition to the potential effect of natural or man-made disasters, significant changes in mortality or morbidity could emerge gradually over time, due to changes in the natural environment, the health habits of the insured population, treatment patterns and technologies for disease or disability, the economic environment, or other factors. Pricing of our insurance and deferred annuity products are also based in part upon expected persistency of these products, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. Persistency within our Individual Annuities business may be significantly impacted by the value of guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current account values in light of poor equity market performance or extended periods of low interest rates as well as other factors. Persistency could be adversely affected generally by developments affecting client perception of us, including perceptions arising from adverse publicity. Results may also vary based on differences between actual and expected premium deposits and withdrawals for these products. The development of a secondary market for life insurance, including life settlements or “viaticals” and investor owned life insurance, and third-party investor strategies in the annuities business, could adversely affect the profitability of existing business and our pricing assumptions for new business. Significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits during the life of the policy or contract, the adjustments permitted under the terms of the policies or contracts may not be sufficient to maintain profitability. Many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits or limit those adjustments during the life of the policy or contract. Even if permitted under the policy or contract, we may not be able or willing to raise premiums or adjust other charges sufficiently, or at all, for regulatory or competitive reasons.    If our reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    We establish and carry reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. Our reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial or statistical estimates based on data and models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment, including as to the levels of and/or timing of receipt or payment of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), retirement, mortality, morbidity and persistency. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits, claims and expenses or whether the assets supporting our policy liabilities, together with future premiums, will be sufficient for payment of benefits and claims. If we conclude that our reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover future policy benefits and claims, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    For certain of our products, market performance and interest rates (as well as the regulatory environment, as discussed further below) impact the level of statutory reserves and statutory capital we are required to hold, and may have an adverse effect on returns on capital associated with these products. For example, equity market    55    Table of Contents  declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 caused a significant increase in the level of statutory reserves and statutory capital we were required to hold in relation to our Individual Annuities business. We finance uneconomic reserves associated with our Individual Life business. Marketplace capacity for reserve funding structures may be limited as a result of market conditions generally. Our ability to efficiently manage capital and economic reserve levels may be impacted, thereby impacting profitability and return on capital.    We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, deferred sales inducements, or DSI, or valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, or recognize impairment in the value of our goodwill or certain investments, or be required to establish a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    Deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, represent the costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts, and we amortize these costs over the expected lives of the contracts. Deferred sales inducements, or DSI, represent amounts that are credited to a policyholder’s account balance as an inducement to purchase the contract, and we amortize these costs over the expected lives of the contracts. Valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts and is amortized over the expected effective lives of the acquired contracts. Management, on an ongoing basis, tests the DAC, DSI and VOBA recorded on our balance sheet to determine if these amounts are recoverable under current assumptions. In addition, we regularly review the estimates and assumptions underlying DAC, DSI and VOBA for those products for which we amortize DAC, DSI and VOBA in proportion to gross profits or gross margins. Given changes in facts and circumstances, these tests and reviews could lead to reductions in DAC, DSI and/or VOBA that could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition. Significant or sustained equity market declines as well as investment losses could result in acceleration of amortization of the DAC, DSI and VOBA related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to income. As discussed earlier, the amortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA are also sensitive to changes in interest rates.    Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is assessed annually for potential impairment, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the carrying value (equity attributed to a business to support its risk) of a business to its estimated fair value at that date. As of December 31, 2010, we had a goodwill balance of $707 million, including $444 million related to our Retirement reporting unit, $239 million related to our Asset Management reporting unit and $24 million related to our International Insurance reporting unit. Market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses, could result in goodwill impairments, resulting in a charge to income.    As of December 31, 2010, we had operating equity method investments within our International Investments business, of $318 million. Declines in the fair value of these investments may require that we review the remaining carrying value of these investments for potential impairment, and such review could result in impairments and charges to income.    Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management’s determination include the performance of the business including the geographic and legal entity source of our income, the ability to generate capital gains from a variety of sources, and tax planning strategies. If based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.    Changes in our discount rate, expected rate of return and expected compensation increase assumptions for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.    We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these assumptions, including from the impact of a sustained low interest rate environment, may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.    56    Table of Contents Our valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.    During periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities, such as sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be cases where certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data become inactive or for which data becomes unobservable due to the current financial environment or market conditions. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods which are more complex. These values may not be ultimately realizable in a market transaction, and such values may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.    The decision on whether to record an other-than-temporary impairment or write-down is determined in part by management’s assessment of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability of the particular security. Management’s conclusions on such assessments are highly judgmental and include assumptions and projections of future cash flows which may ultimately prove to be incorrect as assumptions, facts and circumstances change.    For a discussion of certain fixed maturity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost by 20% or more, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Unrealized Losses from Fixed Maturity Securities.”    We may not be able to mitigate the reserve strain associated with Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX, potentially resulting in a negative impact on our capital position or in a need to increase prices and/or reduce sales of term or universal life products.    The states of domicile of our domestic insurance subsidiaries have in place a regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Regulation XXX,” and a supporting Guideline entitled “The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Guideline AXXX.” The Regulation and supporting Guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees. Many market participants believe that this level of reserves is excessive, and we have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX on our term and universal life insurance business. As we continue to underwrite term and universal life business, we expect to have borrowing needs to finance statutory reserves required under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX. Based on current sales expectations, we believe our 2011 reserve growth could be up to $600 million. We are evaluating both internal and external solutions to fund this growth. If we are unsuccessful in executing these solutions as a result of market conditions or otherwise, this could require us to increase prices and or/reduce our sales of term or universal life products and/or have a negative impact on our capital position.    We have substantial international operations and our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability.    A substantial portion of our revenues and income from continuing operations is derived from our operations outside the U.S., primarily Japan and Korea. These operations are subject to restrictions on transferring funds out of the countries in which these operations are located. Some of our foreign insurance and investment management operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where this risk as well as risks of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’ associations and trade unions, price controls, currency exchange controls, nationalization or expropriation of assets, are heightened. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training our sales force in that country.    57    Table of Contents Many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at contractually fixed guaranteed interest rates, including in Japan. Actual returns on the underlying investments do not necessarily match the guaranteed interest rates and there may be times when the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is negative and in which this negative spread may not be offset by the mortality, morbidity and expense charges we earn on the products.    Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could increase the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products.    Our international operations are regulated in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. These regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of business operations and adversely affect our liquidity, profitability, and regulatory capital.    Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.    As a U.S.-based company with significant business operations outside the U.S., particularly in Japan, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks that could reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings and equity of these operations as well as negatively impact our general account and other proprietary investment portfolios. We seek to mitigate these risks by employing various hedging strategies including entering into derivative contracts and holding U.S. dollar denominated assets within our Japanese subsidiaries. Currency fluctuations, including the effect of changes in the value of U.S. dollar investments that vary from the amounts ultimately needed to hedge our exposure to changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent of earnings and equity of these operations, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Additionally, U.S. dollar denominated investments held in our Japanese subsidiaries could result, in the event of a significant strengthening of the yen, in additional liquidity or capital needs for our International Insurance operations.    Intense competition, including the impact of government sponsored programs and other actions on us and our competitors, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.    In each of our businesses we face intense competition from domestic and foreign insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions, both for the ultimate customers for our products and, in many businesses, for distribution through non-affiliated distribution channels. We compete based on a number of factors including brand recognition, reputation, quality of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of distribution and distribution arrangements, price, perceived financial strength and claims-paying and credit ratings. A decline in our competitive position as to one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and assets under management. Many of our competitors are large and well-established and some have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher claims-paying or credit ratings than we do. The proliferation and growth of non-affiliated distribution channels puts pressure on our captive sales channels to increase their productivity and reduce their costs in order to remain competitive, and we run the risk that the marketplace will make a more significant or rapid shift to non-affiliated or direct distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve ourselves, potentially adversely affecting our market share and results of operations. In certain countries in which we operate internationally, we face competition from government owned entities that benefit from pricing or other competitive advantages. The competitive landscape in which we operate may be further affected by the government sponsored programs in the U.S. and similar governmental actions outside of the U.S. in response to the dislocations in financial markets. Competitors that receive governmental financing or other assistance or subsidies, including governmental guarantees of their obligations, or that are not subject to the same regulatory constraints, may have or obtain pricing or other competitive advantages.    Competition for personnel in all of our businesses is intense, including for executive officers and management personnel, Prudential Agents, Life Planners, Life Advisors and other sales personnel, and our investment managers. We devote significant efforts to talent management and development and are subject to the    58    Table of Contents  risk that executive, management and other personnel will be hired or recruited by competitors. Competition for desirable non-affiliated distribution channels is also intense. The loss of key personnel or non-affiliated distribution channels could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.    We may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels.    Although we distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution channels, we do maintain relationships with certain key distributors. For example, a significant amount of our sales in Japan through banks is derived through a single Japanese mega-bank and a significant portion of our sales in Japan through Life Advisors is derived through a single association relationship. We recently initiated a distribution relationship with a second large Japanese bank and will continue to explore other opportunities to expand our distribution capabilities through the bank channel, as well as other complementary distribution channels. We periodically negotiate the terms of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such third parties. An interruption in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Distributors may elect to reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, including for such reasons as adverse developments in our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. We are also at risk that key distribution partners may merge, change their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us. An increase in bank and broker-dealer consolidation activity could increase competition for access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses and impair our ability to market products through these channels. Consolidation of distributors and/or other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.    When our products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution despite our training and compliance programs. If our products are distributed by such firms in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, we may suffer reputational and other harms to our business.    Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.    Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of this regulation is primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, including those to which our international businesses are subject, are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. The financial market dislocations we have experienced have produced, and are expected to continue to produce, extensive changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks, applicable to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally.    Prudential Financial is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE relating to public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate governance matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and regulations adopted in furtherance of that Act have substantially increased the requirements in these and other areas for public companies such as Prudential Financial.    Many insurance regulatory and other governmental or self-regulatory bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of material pending litigation and regulatory matters, see “Commitments and Guarantees, Contingent Liabilities and Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Congress from time to time considers pension reform legislation that could decrease the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an    59    Table of Contents  unfavorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. In this regard, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) made significant changes in employer pension funding obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans which are likely to increase sponsors’ costs of maintaining these plans. Over time, these changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other services, but could increase the attractiveness of certain group annuity products we offer in connection with terminating pension plans. Certain tax-favored savings initiatives that have been proposed could hinder sales and persistency of our products and services that support employment based retirement plans    Insurance regulators have begun to implement significant changes in the way in which industry participants must determine statutory reserves and statutory capital, particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees such as variable annuities, and are considering further potentially significant changes in these requirements. Regulatory capital requirements based on scenario testing have already gone into effect for variable annuity and certain fixed annuity products and products with similar features, and new reserving requirements for these products were implemented as of the end of 2009. The timing and extent of further changes to the statutory reporting framework are uncertain.    Currently, there are several proposals to amend state insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of the regulation of insurance holding companies (such as Prudential Financial). These proposals include imposing standards for insurer corporate governance, group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies, adjustments to risk-based capital calculations to account for group-wide risks, and additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for insurance holding companies. In addition, state insurance regulators have focused attention on U.S. insurance solvency regulation pursuant to the NAIC’s “Solvency Modernization Initiative.” At this time, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on Prudential Financial.    The Financial Services Agency, the insurance regulator in Japan, has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company’s core capital is calculated. These changes are effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012; however, it is anticipated that companies may begin to publicly disclose prior to that date both the old and new solvency margin calculations. While we believe that the solvency margins of our Japanese insurance subsidiaries would continue to satisfy regulatory requirements and our internal targets, it is possible that a reduction in our reported ratios arising from changes in the calculation requirements could affect customer perception of our financial strength. The capital requirements in Korea and Taiwan are also undergoing change.    Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.    See “Business—Regulation” for further discussion of the impact of regulations on our businesses.    The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation and we cannot predict the effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.    On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation. Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process anticipated to occur over the next few years. We cannot predict with any certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact our business, credit or financial strength ratings, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition or advise or require us to hold or raise additional capital. Key aspects we have identified to date of Dodd-Frank’s potential impact on us include:        •    Prudential Financial will become subject, as a savings and loan holding company, to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”), which will have authority, among other    60    Table of Contents       powers, to impose capital requirements on the Company. We cannot predict what capital regulations the FRB will promulgate or how the FRB will exercise general supervisory authority over us.        •    If designated by the newly established Financial Stability Oversight Council (“Council”) as a systemically significant company, we would become subject to unspecified stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and credit exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements, management interlock prohibitions and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress. Failure to meet defined measures of financial condition could result in substantial restrictions on our business. We cannot predict whether Prudential Financial or a subsidiary will be so designated.        •    We will become subject, as a savings and loan holding company (and if designated as a systemically significant company) to stress tests to be promulgated by the FRB which could cause us to alter our business practices or affect the perceptions of regulators, rating agencies, customers, counterparties or investors of our financial strength.        •    The Council could recommend new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices we and other financial services companies engage in. We cannot predict whether any such recommendations will be made or their effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.        •    As a savings and loan holding company, we will become subject to the “Volcker Rule” provisions of Dodd-Frank prohibiting, subject to the rule’s exceptions, “proprietary trading” and the sponsorship of, and investment in, funds (referred to in Dodd-Frank as hedge funds or private equity funds) that rely on certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (collectively, “covered funds”). It is possible that regulations could require us to dispose of covered fund investments, significantly alter our business practices in these operations and/or diminish the attractiveness of our covered fund products to clients. In addition, actions taken by other financial entities in response to the Volcker Rule could potentially negatively affect the market for, returns from or liquidity of our investments in covered funds affiliated with such other financial entities.        •    Dodd-Frank creates a new framework for regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets which could impact various activities of Prudential Global Funding (“PGF”), Prudential Financial and our insurance subsidiaries, which use derivatives for various purposes (including hedging interest rate, foreign currency and equity market exposures). Final regulations adopted could substantially increase the cost of hedging and related operations, affect the profitability of our products or their attractiveness to our clients or cause us to alter our hedging strategy or implementation thereof or increase and/or change the composition of the risks we do not hedge.        •    Dodd-Frank establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury which will perform various functions with respect to insurance and will conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states.        •    The FRB could require us to legally separate our financial and non-financial activities. While our non-financial activities are relatively minor, the imposition of such a requirement on us could be burdensome and costly to implement.        •    Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company such as Prudential Financial may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the FDIC as receiver, upon a determination that the company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. We cannot predict how creditors of Prudential Financial or its insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, including the holders of Prudential Financial debt, will evaluate this potential or whether it will impact our financing or hedging costs.        •    Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect our business practices and the liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith.        •    Dodd-Frank will and could impose various assessments on us, which we are unable to estimate at this time.    See “Business—Regulation” for further discussion of the impact of Dodd-Frank on our businesses.    61    Table of Contents Foreign governmental actions in response to the recent financial crisis could subject us to substantial additional regulation.    In addition to the adoption of Dodd-Frank in the United States, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations, and the G20 have issued a series of papers and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members of large and complex financial groups, should be regulated. The lawmakers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which we do business have already begun introducing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holdings companies by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan, proposals governing executive compensation by the financial regulators in Germany (BaFIN) and the United Kingdom (FSA), and proposals to permit U.S.-style class action litigation in the United Kingdom with respect to financial services claims. In addition, the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance companies across the European Economic Area (EEA) is due for significant change under the Solvency II Directive, which was adopted on November 25, 2009 and is expected to come into force in January 2013. This new regime will effect a full revision of the insurance industry’s solvency framework and prudential regime and may have significant implications for non-European insurance groups, like ourselves, that have established insurance undertakings (whether branches or subsidiaries) within the EEA.    We cannot predict with any certainty the effect these initiatives may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.    Changes in accounting requirements could negatively impact our reported results of operations and our reported financial position.    Accounting standards are continuously evolving and subject to change. For example, it has been proposed that companies like Prudential Financial be required to report financial results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board rather than U.S. GAAP. Regardless of whether the SEC requires IFRS, it is expected that U.S. GAAP will undergo extensive changes as a result of current standard setting initiatives of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These and other changes in accounting standards may impose special demands on issuers in areas such as corporate governance, internal controls and disclosure. Changes in accounting standards, or their interpretation, may negatively effect our reported results of operations and our reported financial condition.    Changes in U.S. federal income tax law or in the income tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could make some of our products less attractive to consumers and increase our tax costs.    Current U.S. federal income tax laws generally permit certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance products, such as a reduction in income tax rates, as well as other types of changes that could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of annuities and life insurance products to consumers, such as changes to the estate tax. Tax laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions also impact the relative attractiveness of our products.    For example, the estate tax was completely eliminated for 2010, but modified carryover basis rules applied for property acquired from decedent’s dying in that year. The estate tax has been reinstated through 2012 with a $5 million individual exemption, a 35% maximum rate and step-up in basis rules for property acquired from a decedent. Estates of decedents who died in 2010 can choose between the rules that were in effect in 2010 or the new rules. It is unclear what Congress will do with respect to the estate tax after 2012. This uncertainty makes estate planning difficult and may impact sales of our products.    Congress, as well as state and local governments, also considers from time to time legislation that could increase the amount of corporate taxes we pay. For example, changes in the law relating to tax reserving methodologies for term life or universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees or other products could result in higher current taxes.    62    Table of Contents The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have indicated that they intend to address through regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction, or DRD, related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and the expected tax amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. A change in the DRD, including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through regulations or legislation, could increase our actual tax expense and reduce our consolidated net income.    On February 14, 2011, the Obama Administration released the “General Explanations of the Administration’s Revenue Proposals,” or Revenue Proposals. Although the Administration has not released proposed statutory language, the Revenue Proposals include proposals which, if enacted, would affect the taxation of life insurance companies and certain life insurance products. In particular, the proposals would affect the treatment of corporate owned life insurance policies, or COLI, by limiting the availability of certain interest deductions for companies that purchase those policies. The proposals would also change the method used to determine the amount of dividend income received by a life insurance company on assets held in separate accounts used to support products, including variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts that are eligible for the DRD. If proposals of this type were enacted, the Company’s sale of COLI, variable annuities, and variable life insurance products could be adversely affected and the Company’s actual tax expense could increase, thereby reducing earnings.    The Revenue Proposals also includes proposals that would change the method by which multinational corporations could claim credits for the foreign taxes they pay and that would change the timing of the deduction for interest expense that is allocable to foreign-source income. More specifically, it is likely that the proposals would impose additional restrictions on the Company’s ability to claim foreign tax credits on un-repatriated earnings. The proposals would also require U.S. multinationals to defer the deduction for interest expense that is allocable to foreign source income until that income is subject to U.S. tax. Unused deductions would be carried forward to future years. If proposals of this type were enacted, the Company’s actual tax expense could increase, thereby reducing earnings.    There is generally uncertainty regarding U.S. taxes both for individuals and corporations in light of the fact that many tax provisions recently enacted or extended will sunset by the end of 2012. In addition, the recommendations made by the President’s bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and other deficit reduction panels suggest the need to reform the U.S. Tax Code. In addition, Congress plans to hold a number of hearings during 2011 devoted to tax reform. It is unclear whether or when Congress may take up overall tax reform and what would be the impact of reform on the Company and its products. However even in the absence of overall tax reform, the large federal deficit, as well as the budget constraints faced by many states and localities, increases the likelihood that Congress and state and local governments will raise revenue by enacting legislation increasing the taxes paid by individuals and corporations. This can be accomplished either by raising rates or otherwise changing the tax rules. While higher tax rates increase the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance, making our products more attractive to consumers, legislation that reduces or eliminates deferral would have a potential negative effect on our products. In addition, changes in the tax rules that result in higher corporate taxes will increase the Company’s actual tax expense, thereby reducing earnings.    The products we sell have different tax characteristics, in some cases generating tax deductions. The level of profitability of certain of our products is significantly dependent on these characteristics and our ability to continue to generate taxable income, which is taken into consideration when pricing products and is a component of our capital management strategies. Accordingly, changes in tax law, our ability to generate taxable income, or other factors impacting the availability or value of the tax characteristics generated by our products, could impact product pricing and returns or require us to reduce our sales of these products or implement other actions that could be disruptive to our businesses.    Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position or harm our businesses or reputation.    We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including in businesses that we have divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these    63    Table of Contents  proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Legal liability or adverse publicity in respect of these or future legal or regulatory actions could have an adverse affect on us or cause us reputational harm, which in turn could harm our business prospects.    Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us, and certain risks to our businesses presented by such matters, are discussed under “Commitments and Guarantees, Contingent Liabilities and Litigation and Regulatory Matters” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our litigation and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. Our reserves for litigation and regulatory matters may prove to be inadequate. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.    We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.    We rely on a combination of contractual rights with third parties and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we endeavor to protect our rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. This would represent a diversion of resources that may be significant and our efforts may not prove successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.    We may be subject to claims by third parties for (i) patent, trademark or copyright infringement, (ii) breach of copyright, trademark or license usage rights, or (iii) misappropriation of trade secrets. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or other intellectual property right, we could in some circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly work around. Any of these scenarios could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.    The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    The occurrence of natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, including in the following respects:        •    Catastrophic loss of life due to natural or man-made disasters could cause us to pay benefits at higher levels and/or materially earlier than anticipated and could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates.        •    A natural or man-made disaster could result in losses in our investment portfolio or the failure of our counterparties to perform, or cause significant volatility in global financial markets.        •    A terrorist attack affecting financial institutions in the United States or elsewhere could negatively impact the financial services industry in general and our business operations, investment portfolio and profitability in particular. In August 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified our Newark, New Jersey facilities, along with those of several other financial institutions in New York and Washington, D.C., as possible targets of a terrorist attack.        •    Pandemic disease, caused by a virus such as H5N1, the “avian flu” virus, or H1N1, the “swine flu” virus, could have a severe adverse effect on Prudential Financial’s business. The potential impact of such a    64    Table of Contents       pandemic on Prudential Financial’s results of operations and financial position is highly speculative, and would depend on numerous factors, including: in the case of the avian flu virus, the probability of the virus mutating to a form that can be passed easily from human to human; the effectiveness of vaccines and the rate of contagion; the regions of the world most affected; the effectiveness of treatment for the infected population; the rates of mortality and morbidity among various segments of the insured versus the uninsured population; the collectability of reinsurance; the possible macroeconomic effects of a pandemic on the Company’s asset portfolio; the effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies; and many other variables.    There can be no assurance that our business continuation plans and insurance coverages would be effective in mitigating any negative effects on our operations or profitability in the event of a terrorist attack or other disaster.    Climate change, and its regulation, may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold and other counterparties, including reinsurers, and affect the value of investments, including real estate investments we hold or manage for others. Our current evaluation is that the near term effects of climate change and climate change regulation on the Company are not material, but we cannot predict the long term impacts on us from climate change or its regulation.    Our risk management policies and procedures and our minority investments in joint ventures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.    Our policies, procedures and controls to monitor and manage risks, including hedging programs that utilize derivative financial instruments, may not be fully effective in achieving their purposes and may leave us exposed to unidentified and unanticipated risks. The Company uses models in its hedging programs and many other aspects of its operations, including but not limited to the estimation of actuarial reserves, the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the valuation of business acquired, and the valuation of certain other assets and liabilities. These models rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies, procedures and controls to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies, procedures and controls may not be fully effective.    Past or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor associates’ business decisions and prevent us from taking excessive or inappropriate risks, there can be no assurance that these controls and procedures are or may be effective. We review our compensation policies and practices as part of our overall risk management program, but it is possible that our compensation policies and practices could inadvertently incentivize excessive or inappropriate risk taking. If our associates take excessive or inappropriate risks, those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.    In our investments in which we hold a minority interest, we lack management and operational control over operations, which may prevent us from taking or causing to be taken actions to protect or increase the value of those investments. In those jurisdictions where we are constrained by law from owning a majority interest in jointly owned operations, our remedies in the event of a breach by a joint venture partner may be limited (e.g., we may have no ability to exercise a “call” option).    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm our business.    We depend heavily on our telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses and service our customers. These systems may    65    Table of Contents  fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Further, we face the risk of operational and technology failures by others, including clearing agents, exchanges and other financial intermediaries and of vendors and parties to which we outsource the provision of services or business operations. If these parties do not perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business. These risks are heightened by our offering of increasingly complex products, such as those that feature automatic asset transfer or re-allocation strategies, and by our employment of complex investment, trading and hedging programs.    Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to customers.    Interruption in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, whether due to actions by us or others, could delay or disrupt our ability to do business and service our customers, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and other claims, lead to a loss of customers and revenues and otherwise adversely affect our business.    We face risks arising from acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, including client losses, surrenders and withdrawals, difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and contingent liabilities with respect to dispositions.    We face a number of risks arising from acquisition transactions, including the risk that, following the acquisition or reorganization of a business, we could experience client losses, surrenders or withdrawals or other results materially different from those we anticipate, as well as difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and restructurings and managing the litigation and regulatory matters to which acquired entities are party. We have retained insurance or reinsurance obligations and other contingent liabilities in connection with our divestiture or winding down of various businesses, and our reserves for these obligations and liabilities may prove to be inadequate. These risks may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.    We are subject to risks relating to the acquisition, and post-acquisition operations, of the Star and Edison businesses in Japan.    On February 1, 2011, we completed the acquisition from American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”) of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (“Star”) and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company (“Edison”) and certain other AIG subsidiaries in Japan (the “Acquisition”). For a description of the acquired businesses (collectively, the “Star and Edison Businesses”) and the Acquisition, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under “Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—International Insurance and Investments Division” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” We are subject to certain risks relating to the Acquisition and the Star and Edison Businesses, which risks could adversely affect, possibly materially, our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity or prevent us from realizing the expected benefits from the Acquisition. These risks include the following:        •    We may experience difficulties in integrating the Star and Edison Businesses and the process of integration may take longer than expected. Our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipate from the Acquisition will depend upon whether we are able to integrate the Star and Edison Businesses into our existing Japanese business in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of certain operations will require the dedication of significant management resources over a long period, which may distract management’s attention from day-to-day business operations.        •    We expect to incur significant one-time costs in connection with the Acquisition and the related integration of the Star and Edison Businesses. The costs and liabilities actually incurred in connection with the Acquisition and subsequent integration process may exceed those anticipated. We may not realize cost savings, efficiencies or synergies that we anticipate.    66    Table of Contents     •    We intend to reposition the existing investment portfolios of the Star and Edison Businesses to reflect our desired lower risk profile, including a re-allocation among investment asset classes. The terms at which this repositioning is implemented are dependent on market conditions, including the level of interest rates, and such repositioning may lower yields and net investment income relative to our expectations. We may not be successful in carrying out this repositioning as intended, or we may experience delays in effecting the repositioning, in which case the portfolios may be subject to a level of investment risk that is greater than we plan or believe to be optimal.        •    There is the risk that we will be exposed to obligations and liabilities of Star and Edison that are not adequately covered, in amount, scope or duration, by the indemnification provisions in the stock purchase agreement or reflected or reserved for in the historical financial statements of the Star and Edison Businesses, and there is the risk that such historical financial statements may contain errors.        •    The publicized financial difficulties involving AIG have negatively affected the Star and Edison Businesses. Any perception of additional instability surrounding AIG or other events relating to AIG may adversely impact the reputation of the Star and Edison Businesses or of the Company and adversely affect the ability of the Star and Edison Businesses to retain employees, customers and distributors. Furthermore, following the completion of the Acquisition, the Star and Edison Businesses will continue to have relationships with and rely upon AIG, including for the receipt of transition services.    The Star and Edison Businesses are also subject to many of the other risks described in this section to which our existing businesses, particularly those in Japan, are subject, including but not limited to risks associated with economic, market and political conditions, capital and liquidity, foreign exchange fluctuations and regulatory and legal matters.    Regulatory requirements, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and our shareholder rights plan could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.    Various states in which our insurance companies are domiciled, including New Jersey, must approve any direct or indirect change of control of insurance companies organized in those states. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. Federal, and in some cases, state, banking authorities would also have to approve the indirect change of control of our banking operations. The federal securities laws could also require reapproval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control. In addition, the New Jersey Business Corporation Act prohibits certain business combinations with interested shareholders. These regulatory and other restrictions may delay a potential merger or sale of Prudential Financial, even if the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interests of shareholders to merge or be sold.    Prudential Financial’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Stock and include: a restriction on the filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors by shareholders; restrictions on the calling of special meetings by shareholders; a requirement that shareholders may take action without a meeting only by unanimous written consent; advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates to the Board of Directors and shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholder meetings; and supermajority voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Prudential Financial’s shareholders rights plan also creates obstacles that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.    67    Table of Contents Holders of our Common Stock are subject to risks due to the issuance of our Class B Stock, a second class of common stock.    The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, and our Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. There are a number of risks to holders of our Common Stock by virtue of this dual common stock structure, including:        •    Even though we allocate all our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for financial statement purposes, there is no legal separation between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Financial Services Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed Block Business; and therefore holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in the Company.        •    The financial results of the Closed Block Business, including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs.        •    The market value of our Common Stock may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.        •    We cannot pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for any period if we choose not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount on the Class B Stock for that period. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Convertibility” for the definition of these terms. Any net losses of the Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of the Class B Stock, would reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally available for dividends on the Common Stock.        •    Net income for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the respective Businesses based on the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows to the Financial Services Businesses from the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. The difference between the administrative expenses allocated to the Closed Block Business and these cash flow amounts are recorded, on an after tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of the businesses and included in the determination of earnings per share for each Business. A change in cash flow amounts between the Businesses that is inconsistent with changes in general and administrative expenses we incur will affect the earnings per share of the Common Stock and Class B Stock.        •    Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock vote together as a single class of common stock under New Jersey law, except as otherwise required by law and except that the holders of the Class B Stock have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified matters directly affecting the Class B Stock.        •    Shares of Class B Stock are entitled to a higher proportionate amount upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Prudential Financial, than shares of Common Stock.        •    We may exchange the Class B Stock for shares of Common Stock at any time, and the Class B Stock is mandatorily exchangeable in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the Closed Block Business or a “change of control” of Prudential Financial. Under these circumstances, shares of Class B Stock would be exchanged for shares of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value equal to 120% of the then appraised “Fair Market Value” of the Class B Stock. For a description of “change of control” and “Fair Market Value,” see “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Convertibility.” Holders of Class B Stock may at their discretion, beginning in 2016, and at any time in the event of specified regulatory events, convert their shares of Class B Stock into shares of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the then appraised Fair Market Value of the Class B Stock. Any exchange or conversion could occur at a time when either or both of the Common Stock and Class B Stock may be considered overvalued or undervalued. Accordingly, any such exchange or conversion may be disadvantageous to holders of Common Stock.    68    Table of Contents     •    Our Board of Directors has adopted certain policies regarding inter-business transfers and accounting and tax matters, including the allocation of earnings, with respect to the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business. Although the Board of Directors may change any of these policies, any such decision is subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties, and we have agreed with investors in the Class B Stock and the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most cases, the Board of Directors may not change these policies without their consent.
