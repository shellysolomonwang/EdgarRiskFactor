ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    You should carefully consider the following risks. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our Common Stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” above and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Some of our businesses and our results of operations were materially adversely affected by adverse conditions in the global financial markets and adverse economic conditions generally that began in the second half of 2007 and continued into 2009. Our businesses, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected, possibly materially, if these conditions recur or current market or economic conditions deteriorate.    Our results of operations were materially adversely affected by adverse conditions in the global financial markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world that began in the second half of 2007 and continued into 2009. The global financial markets experienced extreme stress. Volatility and disruption in the global financial markets reached unprecedented levels for the post World War II period. The availability and cost of credit were materially affected. These factors, combined with economic conditions in the U.S., including depressed home and commercial real estate prices and increasing foreclosures, falling equity market values, declining business and consumer confidence and rising unemployment, precipitated a severe economic recession and fears of even more severe and prolonged adverse economic conditions.    Due to the economic environment, the global fixed-income markets experienced both extreme volatility and limited market liquidity conditions, which affected a broad range of asset classes and sectors. As a result, the market for fixed income instruments experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased probability of default. Global equity markets also experienced heightened volatility. These events had and, to the extent they persist or recur, may have an adverse effect on us. Our revenues are likely to decline in such circumstances, the cost of meeting our obligations to our customers may increase, and our profit margins would likely erode. In addition, in the event of a prolonged or severe economic downturn, we could incur significant losses in our investment portfolio.    The demand for our products could be adversely affected in an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower consumer spending, lower corporate earnings and lower business investment. We also may experience a higher incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Our policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums. We cannot predict definitively whether or when such actions, which could impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, may occur.    Beginning in the second half of 2007 and continuing into 2009, markets in the United States and elsewhere experienced extreme and unprecedented volatility and disruption, with adverse consequences to our liquidity, access to capital and cost of capital. A recurrence of market conditions such as those we recently experienced may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and our cost of capital, including capital that may be required by our subsidiaries. Under such conditions, we may seek additional debt or equity capital but be unable to obtain such.    Adverse capital market conditions have affected and may affect in the future the availability and cost of borrowed funds and could impact our ability to refinance existing borrowings, thereby ultimately impacting our    42    Table of Contents  profitability and ability to support or grow our businesses. We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock and replace certain maturing debt obligations. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail certain of our operations, and our business could suffer. The principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums, annuity considerations, deposit funds and cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including securities lending and repurchase agreements, commercial paper, medium and long-term debt and capital securities.    Disruptions, uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets limited and, to the extent they persist or recur, may limit in the future our access to capital required to operate our business, most significantly our insurance and annuities operations. These market conditions may in the future limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing debt obligations and access the capital necessary to grow our business, replace capital withdrawn by customers or raise new capital required by our subsidiaries as a result of volatility in the markets. As a result, under such conditions we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter tenor securities than would be optimal, bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price, which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Actions we might take to access financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings. Our ability to borrow under our commercial paper programs is also dependent upon market conditions. Future deterioration of our capital position at a time when we are unable to access the long-term debt or commercial paper markets could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient.    We may seek additional debt or equity financing to satisfy our needs. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, and our credit ratings and credit capacity. We may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. Further, any future equity offerings would dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.    The Risk Based Capital, or RBC, ratio is a primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of Prudential Insurance, which includes businesses in both the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. We have managed Prudential Insurance’s RBC ratio to a level consistent with a “AA” ratings objective; however, rating agencies take into account a variety of factors in assigning ratings to our insurance subsidiaries in addition to RBC levels. RBC is determined by statutory rules that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets, insurance-related risks associated with Prudential Insurance’s products, interest rate risks and general business risks. The RBC ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of Prudential Insurance’s statutory capitalization. In addition, RBC ratios may also impact our credit and claims paying ratings. We estimate that as of December 31, 2009 the RBC for Prudential Insurance and our other domestic life insurance subsidiaries would exceed the minimum level required by applicable insurance regulations.    Disruptions in the capital markets could adversely affect Prudential Financial’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, as well as threaten to reduce our capital below a level that is consistent with our existing ratings objectives. Therefore, we may need to take actions, which may include but are not limited to: (1) further access external sources of capital, including the debt or equity markets, as noted above; (2) reduce or eliminate future shareholder dividends on our Common Stock; (3) utilize further proceeds from our outstanding retail medium term notes for general corporate purposes by accelerating repayments of additional funding agreements from Prudential Insurance; (4) undertake additional capital management activities, including reinsurance transactions; (5) transfer ownership of certain subsidiaries of Prudential Financial to Prudential Insurance; (6) take additional actions related to derivatives; (7) limit or curtail sales of certain products and/or restructure existing products; (8) undertake further asset sales or internal asset transfers; and (9) seek temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules. Certain of these actions may require regulatory approval and/or agreement of counterparties which are outside of our control or have economic costs associated with them.    We maintain committed unsecured revolving credit facilities that, as of December 31, 2009, totaled $4.34 billion. We rely on these credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity which could be critical in enabling us to meet our obligations as they come due, particularly during periods when alternative sources of liquidity are    43    Table of Contents  limited such as in the recent market environment. Our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on our satisfaction of covenants and other requirements contained in the facilities, such as Prudential Insurance’s maintenance of total adjusted capital of at least $5.5 billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under New Jersey law and Prudential Financial’s maintenance of consolidated net worth of at least $12.5 billion, which for this purpose is based on U.S. GAAP stockholders’ equity, excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments. Our failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the credit facilities would restrict our access to the facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    Our asset management operations include real estate held in Prudential Insurance separate accounts, for the benefit of clients, which enter into forward commitments which typically are funded from separate account assets and cash flows and related funding sources. Owing to the recent adverse credit and real estate capital market conditions, which have also impacted fund liquidity, these separate accounts could experience challenges funding commitments in the normal course. In that case, Prudential Insurance might be called upon or required to provide interim funding solutions, which could affect the availability of liquidity for other purposes.    Market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions may adversely affect our business and profitability.    Even under relatively favorable market conditions, our insurance and annuities products and certain of our investment products, as well as our investment returns and our access to and cost of financing, are sensitive to fixed income, equity, real estate and other market fluctuations and general economic, market and political conditions. These fluctuations and conditions could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity, including in the following respects:        •    The profitability of many of our insurance and annuities products depends in part on the value of the separate accounts supporting these products, which fluctuate substantially depending on the foregoing conditions.        •    Market conditions resulting in reductions in the value of assets we manage have an adverse effect on the revenues and profitability of our asset management services, which depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, and could further decrease the value of our proprietary investments.        •    A change in market conditions, including prolonged periods of high inflation, could cause a change in consumer sentiment adversely affecting sales and persistency of our long-term savings and protection products. Similarly, changing economic conditions and unfavorable public perception of financial institutions can influence customer behavior, including but not limited to increasing claims in certain product lines.        •    Sales of our investment-based and asset management products and services may decline, and lapses and surrenders of variable life and annuity products and withdrawals of assets from other investment products may increase if a market downturn, increased market volatility or other market conditions result in customers becoming dissatisfied with their investments or products.        •    A market decline could further result in guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current account values or our pricing assumptions would support, requiring us to materially increase reserves for such products and may cause customers to retain contracts in force in order to benefit from the guarantees, thereby increasing their cost to us. Our valuation of the liabilities for the minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products requires us to consider the market perception of our risk of non-performance, and a decrease in our own credit spreads resulting from ratings upgrades or other events or market conditions could cause the recorded value of these liabilities to increase, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.        •    Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms which could adversely affect the profitability of future business or our willingness to write future business.    44    Table of Contents     •    Hedging instruments we hold to manage foreign exchange, product, and other risks might not perform as intended or expected resulting in higher realized losses and unforeseen cash needs. Market conditions can limit availability of hedging instruments and also further increase the cost of executing product related hedges and such costs may not be recovered in the pricing of the underlying products being hedged. Our hedging strategies rely on the performance of counterparties to such hedges. These counterparties may fail to perform for various reasons resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on uncollateralized positions.        •    We have significant investment and derivative portfolios, including but not limited to corporate and asset-backed securities, equities and commercial real estate. Economic conditions as well as adverse capital market conditions, including but not limited to a lack of buyers in the marketplace, volatility, credit spread changes, benchmark interest rate changes, and declines in value of underlying collateral will impact the credit quality, liquidity and value of our investments and derivatives, potentially resulting in higher capital charges and unrealized or realized losses, the latter especially if we were to need to sell a significant amount of investments under such conditions. For example, a widening of credit spreads increases the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio and may ultimately result in increased realized losses. Values of our investments and derivatives can also be impacted by reductions in price transparency, changes in assumptions or inputs we use in estimating fair value and changes in investor confidence and preferences, potentially resulting in higher realized or unrealized losses. Volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. Valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and in certain cases under U.S. GAAP such period to period changes in the value of investments are not recognized in our results of operations or consolidated statements of financial condition.        •    Opportunities for investment of available funds, including proceeds received from the sale of the Company’s interest in the Wachovia Securities (Wells Fargo Advisors) retail brokerage joint venture, at appropriate returns may be limited, with a possible negative impact on our overall results.        •    Regardless of market conditions, certain investments we hold, including private bonds and commercial mortgages, are relatively illiquid. If we needed to sell these investments, we may have difficulty doing so in a timely manner at a price that we could otherwise realize.        •    Fluctuations in our operating results and the impact on our investment portfolio may impact the Company’s tax profile and its ability to optimally utilize tax attributes.    Interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our businesses and profitability.    Our insurance and annuities products and certain of our investment products, and our investment returns, are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, and changes in interest rates could adversely affect our investment returns and results of operations, including in the following respects:        •    Some of our products expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce the spread between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the rate of return we are able to earn on our general account investments supporting the contracts. When interest rates decline, we have to reinvest the cash income from our investments in lower yielding instruments. Since many of our policies and contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates or limit the resetting of interest rates, the spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. When interest rates rise, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account with the higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep these products and contracts competitive. This risk is heightened in market and economic conditions such as we have recently experienced, in which many desired securities may be unavailable.        •    Changes in interest rates may reduce net investment income and thus our spread income which is a substantial portion of our profitability. Changes in interest rates can also result in potential losses in our investment activities in which we borrow funds and purchase investments to earn additional spread income on the borrowed funds. A decline in market interest rates could also reduce our returns from investment of equity.    45    Table of Contents     •    When interest rates rise, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as policyholders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns, requiring us to sell investment assets potentially resulting in realized investment losses, or requiring us to accelerate the amortization of DAC or VOBA (both defined below).        •    A decline in interest rates accompanied by unexpected prepayments of certain investments could result in reduced investments and a decline in our profitability. An increase in interest rates accompanied by unexpected extensions of certain lower yielding investments could result in a decline in our profitability.        •    Changes in the relationship between long-term and short-term interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of some of our products.        •    Changes in interest rates could increase our costs of financing.        •    Our mitigation efforts with respect to interest rate risk are primarily focused on maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. However, there are practical and capital market limitations on our ability to accomplish this, especially in some of our Asian operations, and our estimate of the liability cash flow profile may be inaccurate. Due to these and other factors we may need to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to satisfy liabilities or be forced to reinvest funds in a lower rate environment. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to effectively mitigate, and may choose based on factors, including economic considerations, not to fully mitigate, the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities.    If our reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    We establish and carry reserves to pay future policyholder benefits and claims. Our reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather are actuarial or statistical estimates based on models that include many assumptions and projections which are inherently uncertain and involve the exercise of significant judgment, including as to the levels of and/or timing of receipt or payment of premiums, benefits, claims, expenses, interest credits, investment results (including equity market returns), retirement, mortality, morbidity and persistency. We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay for, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits, claims and expenses or whether the assets supporting our policy liabilities, together with future premiums, will be sufficient for payment of benefits and claims. If we conclude that our reserves, together with future premiums, are insufficient to cover future policy benefits and claims, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    For certain of our products, market performance and interest rates impact the level of statutory reserves and statutory capital we are required to hold, and may have an adverse effect on returns on capital associated with these products. For example, equity market declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 caused a significant increase in the level of statutory reserves and statutory capital we are required to hold in relation to our Individual Annuities business. Capacity for reserve funding structures available in the marketplace may be limited as a result of market conditions generally. Our ability to efficiently manage capital and economic reserve levels may be impacted, thereby impacting profitability and return on capital.    Our profitability may decline if mortality rates, morbidity rates or persistency rates differ significantly from our pricing expectations.    We set prices for many of our insurance and annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns, using assumptions for mortality rates, or likelihood of death, and morbidity rates, or likelihood of sickness, of our policyholders. In addition to the potential effect of natural or man-made disasters, significant changes in mortality or morbidity could emerge gradually over time, due to changes in the natural environment, the health habits of the insured population, treatment patterns for disease or disability, the economic environment, or other factors. Pricing of our insurance and deferred annuity products are also based in part upon    46    Table of Contents  expected persistency of these products, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next. Persistency within our Individual Annuities business may be significantly impacted by the value of guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products being higher than current account values in light of equity market declines. Results may also vary based on differences between actual and expected premium deposits and withdrawals for these products. The development of a secondary market for life insurance, including life settlements or “viaticals” and investor owned life insurance, and to a lesser extent third-party investor strategies in the annuities market, could adversely affect the profitability of existing business and our pricing assumptions for new business. Significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. Although some of our products permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits during the life of the policy or contract, the adjustments permitted under the terms of the policies or contracts may not be sufficient to maintain profitability. Many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or adjust other charges and credits or limit those adjustments during the life of the policy or contract.    We may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, or valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, or recognize impairment in the value of our goodwill or certain investments, or be required to establish a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    Deferred policy acquisition costs, or DAC, represent the costs that vary with and are related primarily to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and annuity contracts, and we amortize these costs over the expected lives of the contracts. Valuation of business acquired, or VOBA, represents the present value of future profits embedded in acquired insurance, annuity and investment-type contracts and is amortized over the expected effective lives of the acquired contracts. Management, on an ongoing basis, tests the DAC and VOBA recorded on our balance sheet to determine if these amounts are recoverable under current assumptions. In addition, we regularly review the estimates and assumptions underlying DAC and VOBA for those products for which we amortize DAC and VOBA in proportion to gross profits or gross margins. Given changes in facts and circumstances, these tests and reviews could lead to reductions in DAC and/or VOBA that could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition. Significant or sustained equity market declines as well as investment losses could result in acceleration of amortization of the DAC and VOBA related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to income.    Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is assessed annually for potential impairment, or more frequently if conditions warrant, by comparing the carrying value (equity attributed to a business to support its risk) of a business to its estimated fair value at that date. As of December 31, 2009, we had a goodwill balance of $709 million, including $444 million related to our Retirement reporting unit, $242 million related to our Asset Management reporting unit and $23 million related to our International Insurance reporting unit. Further market declines or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, or increases in the level of equity required to support these businesses, could result in goodwill impairments, resulting in a charge to income.    As of December 31, 2009, we had operating equity method investments primarily within our International Investments business, of $325 million. Declines in the fair value of these investments may require that we review the remaining carrying value of these investments for potential impairment, and such review could result in impairments and charges to income.    Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management’s determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. If based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.    47    Table of Contents Our valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.    During periods of market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities, such as sub-prime mortgage backed securities, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There are and may continue to be cases where certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data have become inactive or for which data becomes unobservable due to the current financial environment or market conditions. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods which are more complex. These values may not be ultimately realizable in a market transaction, and such values may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.    The decision on whether to record an other-than-temporary impairment or write-down is determined in part by management’s assessment of the financial condition and prospects of a particular issuer, projections of future cash flows and recoverability of the particular security. Management’s conclusions on such assessments are highly judgmental and include assumptions and projections of future cash flows which may ultimately prove to be incorrect as assumptions, facts and circumstances change.    For a discussion of certain fixed maturity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost by more than 20%, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—Unrealized Losses from Fixed Maturity Securities.”    We have experienced and may experience additional downgrades in our claims-paying or credit ratings. A downgrade or potential downgrade in our claims-paying or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered, increase our borrowing costs and/or hurt our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties and restrict our access to alternative sources of liquidity.    Claims-paying ratings, which are sometimes referred to as “financial strength” ratings, represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding the financial ability of an insurance company to meet its obligations under an insurance policy, and are important factors affecting public confidence in an insurer and its competitive position in marketing products, including Prudential Insurance and our other insurance company subsidiaries. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating agencies regarding an entity’s ability to repay its indebtedness, and Prudential Financial’s credit ratings are important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and to the cost of such financing. A downgrade in our claims-paying or credit ratings could potentially, among other things, limit our ability to market products, reduce our competitiveness, increase the number or value of policy surrenders and withdrawals, increase our borrowing costs and potentially make it more difficult to borrow funds, adversely affect the availability of financial guarantees, such as letters of credit, cause additional collateral requirements under certain agreements, allow counterparties to terminate derivative agreements, and/or hurt our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties. In addition, actions we might take to access third party financing or to realign our capital structure may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings.    In view of the difficulties experienced recently by many financial institutions, the rating agencies have heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, have increased the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, have requested additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels, such as the financial strength ratings currently held by our life insurance subsidiaries. The outcome of such reviews may have adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. For a description of the Company’s claims paying and credit ratings and the significant changes to those ratings and rating outlooks in 2009, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Ratings.”    Prudential Insurance has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, or FHLBNY, since June 2008. Membership allows Prudential Insurance to participate in FHLBNY’s product line of financial    48    Table of Contents  services, including collateralized advances, collateralized funding agreements and general asset/liability management that can be used for liquidity management and as an alternative source of funding. Under FHLBNY guidelines, if Prudential Insurance’s claims-paying ratings decline below certain levels and the FHLBNY does not receive written assurances from the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance regarding Prudential Insurance’s solvency, new borrowings from the FHLBNY would be limited to a term of 90 days or less. Although Prudential Insurance’s ratings are currently at or above the required minimum levels, there can be no assurance that the ratings will remain at these levels in the future.    We cannot predict what additional actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without notice by any rating agency.    Ratings downgrades and changes in credit spreads may require us to post collateral, thereby affecting our liquidity, and we may be unable to effectively implement certain capital management activities as a result, or for other reasons.    A downgrade in the credit or financial strength ratings of Prudential Financial or its rated subsidiaries could result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, including derivative agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. A ratings downgrade of three ratings levels from the ratings levels at December 31, 2009 would result in estimated collateral posting requirements or payments under such agreements of approximately $185 million. In addition, a ratings downgrade by A.M. Best to “A-“ for our domestic life insurance companies would require Prudential Insurance to post a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $1.3 billion, based on the level of statutory reserves related to an acquired business, that we estimate would result in annual cash outflows of approximately $18 million, or collateral posting in the form of cash or securities to be held in a trust.    In addition, agreements in connection with capital management activities for our universal life insurance products would require us to post cash collateral based on tests that consider the level of 10-year credit default swap spreads on Prudential Financial’s senior debt. As of December 31, 2009, no collateral amounts were required to be paid.    The NAIC has adopted a Model Regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Regulation XXX,” and a supporting Guideline entitled “The Application of the Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Guideline AXXX.” The Regulation and supporting Guideline require insurers to establish statutory reserves for term and universal life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees that are consistent with the statutory reserves required for other individual life insurance policies with similar guarantees. Many market participants believe that this level of reserves is excessive, and we have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX on our term and universal life insurance business. As we continue to underwrite term and universal life business, we expect to have borrowing needs in 2010 to finance statutory reserves required under Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX. Several strategies are currently under review to reduce the strain of increased AXXX and XXX statutory reserves associated with our term and universal life products. The activities we may undertake to mitigate or address these needs include obtaining letters of credit, entering into reinsurance transactions or executing other capital market strategies; however, our ability to successfully execute these strategies may depend on market conditions. Based on current market conditions and absent any successful mitigation efforts, we currently believe that our financing need for 2010 could be up to $900 million for XXX and AXXX combined; however this need is expected to be met with a combination of the activities described above. If we are unsuccessful in satisfying or mitigating this strain as a result of market conditions or otherwise, this financing need could require us to increase prices and or/reduce our sales of term or universal life products and/or have a negative impact on our capital position.    49    Table of Contents Losses due to defaults by others, including issuers of investment securities or reinsurance, bond insurers and derivative instrument counterparties, downgrades in the ratings of securities we hold or of bond insurers, insolvencies of insurers in jurisdictions where we write business and other factors affecting our counterparties or the value of their securities could adversely affect the value of our investments, the realization of amounts contractually owed to us, result in assessments or additional statutory capital requirements or reduce our profitability or sources of liquidity.     Issuers and borrowers whose securities or loans we hold, customers, vendors, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors, including bond insurers, may default on their obligations to us or be unable to perform service functions that are significant to our business due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. Such defaults, instances of which have occurred in recent months, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A downgrade in the ratings of bond insurers could also result in declines in the value of our fixed maturity investments supported by guarantees from bond insurers.    In addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various risks, including certain guaranteed minimum benefits contained in many of our variable annuity products. We enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. Our obligations under our variable annuity products are not changed by our hedging activities and we are liable for our obligations even if our derivative counterparties do not pay us. This is a more pronounced risk to us in view of the recent stresses suffered by financial institutions. Such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    Under state insurance guaranty association laws and similar laws in international jurisdictions, we are subject to assessments, based on the share of business we write in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants.    Amounts that we expect to collect under current and future contracts, including, but not limited to reinsurance contracts, are subject to counterparty risk.    We use reinsurance as part of our capital management with respect to our Closed Block Business. Ratings downgrades or financial difficulties of reinsurers may require us to utilize additional capital with respect to the business.    The eligible collateral that Prudential Insurance is required to pledge to the FHLBNY in support of its borrowings includes qualifying mortgage-related assets, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities. The major rating agencies have downgraded the credit ratings of certain commercial mortgage-backed securities and may continue to do so. If future downgrades affect the commercial mortgage-backed securities pledged by Prudential Insurance to the FHLBNY, those securities would no longer constitute eligible collateral under FHLBNY guidelines. This could require Prudential Insurance to repay outstanding borrowings or to pledge replacement collateral to the FHLBNY, which could materially reduce the Company’s borrowing capacity from the FHLBNY and/or prevent use of that replacement collateral for asset-based financing transactions.    Intense competition, including the impact of government sponsored programs and other actions on us and our competitors, could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.    In each of our businesses we face intense competition from domestic and foreign insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions, both for the ultimate customers for our products and, in many businesses, for distribution through non-affiliated distribution channels. We compete based on a number of factors including brand recognition, reputation, quality of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of distribution and distribution arrangements, price, perceived financial strength and claims-paying and credit ratings. A decline in our competitive position as to one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and assets under management. Many of our competitors are large and well established and some have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a    50    Table of Contents  broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher claims-paying or credit ratings than we do. We could be subject to claims by competitors that our products, benefits, features, or the administration thereof, infringe their patents, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and financial position. The proliferation and growth of non-affiliated distribution channels puts pressure on our captive sales channels to increase their productivity and reduce their costs in order to remain competitive, and we run the risk that the marketplace will make a more significant or rapid shift to non-affiliated or direct distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve ourselves, potentially adversely affecting our market share and results of operations. Competition for personnel in all of our businesses is intense, including for Prudential Agents, Life Planners and Life Advisors, other face-to-face sales personnel, desirable non-affiliated distribution channels and our investment managers. The loss of personnel could have an adverse effect on our business and profitability.    The adverse market and economic conditions that began in the second half of 2007 and continued into 2009 have resulted in changes in the competitive landscape. For example, the financial distress experienced by certain financial services industry participants as a result of such conditions, including government mandated sales of certain businesses, may lead to favorable acquisition opportunities, although our ability or that of our competitors to pursue such opportunities may be limited due to lower earnings, reserve increases, and a lack of access to debt capital markets and other sources of financing. Such conditions may also lead to changes by us or our competitors in product offerings, product pricing and business mix that could affect our and their relative sales volumes, market shares and profitability. It is also possible that such conditions may put U.S. companies like us with financial operations in non-U.S. locations at a competitive disadvantage relative to domestic companies operating in those locations and may impact sales in those locations. Additionally, the competitive landscape in which we operate may be further affected by the government sponsored programs in the U.S. and similar governmental actions outside of the U.S. in response to the dislocations in financial markets. Competitors receiving governmental financing or other assistance or subsidies, including governmental guarantees of their obligations, may obtain pricing or other competitive advantages.    Governmental actions in response to the recent financial crisis could subject us to substantial additional regulation.    The U.S. federal government and other governments around the world have taken and are considering taking actions to address the recent financial crisis, which are significant. We cannot predict with any certainty whether these actions will be effective or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Governmental actions in response to the recent financial crisis could subject us to substantial additional regulation in the United States and internationally.    Actions taken and being considered by the U.S. federal government to address the recent financial crisis include mortgage and credit card program modification requirements that could impact our business and investments, particularly our mortgage and consumer debt related investments.    During 2009, the Obama Administration and Congress announced proposals to reform the national regulation of financial services and financial institutions. Depending on the manner of adoption of these or other proposals, we could become subject to increased federal regulation. On December 11, 2009, the House of Representatives approved H.R. 4173, the “Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009.” H.R. 4173, if enacted, could affect the Company in a number of ways. In particular, Prudential Financial would become subject to regulation as a thrift holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”), which could exercise its authority in a manner different from current regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision, including the imposition of capital or other prudential requirements on Prudential Financial. In addition, Prudential Financial, or one of its subsidiaries, could be designated as a financial company subject to stricter prudential standards imposed by a newly established financial services oversight council, composed principally of federal regulators and with the FRB acting as its agent, if this council were to determine that material financial distress at the Company or the scope of the Company’s activities could pose a threat to financial stability or the economy. If so designated, we would become subject to unspecified stricter prudential standards, including stricter requirements and limitations relating to capital, leverage, liquidity, debt to income ratios, and counterparty exposure, as well as overall risk management requirements and a requirement to maintain a plan for rapid and orderly dissolution in the event of severe financial distress. Moreover, if so    51    Table of Contents  designated, failure by the Company to satisfy the capitalization requirements imposed could or would result, depending on the degree of under-capitalization, in additional restrictions on or requirements with respect to our business activities, such as restrictions on dividends or stock repurchases, asset growth or transactions with affiliates or requirements to develop and/or implement a capital restoration plan, obtain prior approval for acquisitions or new business lines, divest business lines, replace directors or officers or implement restrictions on senior management compensation.    In addition to heightened regulation of certain financial institutions, H.R. 4173, if enacted, would authorize the FRB to recommend the imposition of stricter prudential standards to activities and practices identified as posing heightened systemic risk. It is possible that any standards so imposed could have significant effects on the Company’s business.    We cannot predict whether Prudential Financial, any of its subsidiaries, or any of the Company’s activities might be designated for stricter standards, if the bill’s provisions became law. Nor can we predict what standards might be imposed, or what impact such standards would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    If enacted, H.R. 4173 would also establish a “Federal Insurance Office” within the Department of the Treasury to be headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office would perform various functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a non-voting member of the financial services oversight council referred to above and participating in that council’s decisions regarding insurers (potentially including the Company) to be designated for stricter regulation. The director would also be required to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states.    If enacted, H.R. 4173, would also subject the Company to a risk-based assessment imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (“FDIC”) to create a Systemic Resolution Fund to pay for the special dissolution of financial companies for which a determination has been made that such resolution is necessary to prevent harm to the financial stability of the United States. It is not possible to quantify what that assessment might be, although it could be significant. Prudential Financial is among the class of companies that theoretically could be subject to the special dissolution regime, which would authorize the FDIC to act as Prudential Financial’s receiver in a proceeding defined by H.R. 4173 in lieu of a proceeding under the Federal bankruptcy code.    In addition, if enacted, H.R. 4173 would create a new framework for regulation of over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets that could impact Prudential Global Funding’s (“PGF”) activities. If the CFTC and the SEC did not exercise their discretion to exclude PGF from the class of regulated derivatives dealers because of the limited nature of its activities, PGF would be compelled to meet capital, margin, clearing and execution rules otherwise imposed by the bill, which could significantly impact the cost of its operations.    Another section of H.R. 4173, the “Investor Protection Act,” if enacted, would, among other things, require the SEC to impose on registered broker-dealers that provide retail investors personalized investment advice about securities a new standard of conduct the same as the overall standard for investment advisers (i.e. a fiduciary standard). The Investor Protection Act would also require broker-dealers selling proprietary or a limited range of products to make certain disclosures and obtain customer consents or acknowledgements. We cannot predict the precise nature of the regulations the SEC would implement were H.R. 4173 enacted, but they could impact the manner in which certain of our businesses operate.    The Senate has not approved comparable legislation, although proposals include provisions addressing special resolution authority for failing financial institutions, systemic risk regulation, and increased derivatives oversight, which could impact Prudential. We cannot predict the form in which proposals will finally be adopted (if at all) or their applicability to or effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.    On February 1, 2010, the Obama Administration released the “General Explanations of the Administration’s Revenue Proposals,” which includes proposed legislation that would impose a Financial Crisis Responsibility    52    Table of Contents  Fee (“FCRF”) on certain financial institutions with over $50 billion in consolidated assets as of January 14, 2010. As proposed, the FCRF would apply to insurance companies or other companies that own insured depositories, which would include the Company. The FCRF would be imposed at a rate of “approximately” 15 basis points on the “worldwide consolidated liabilities” of companies subject to the FCRF, which includes a broad set of liabilities with a few exceptions, including certain “policy-related liabilities” of insurance companies. The FCRF would be imposed effective as of July 1, 2010. The amount of the FCRF that would be imposed upon the Company under this proposal, in the event it is enacted into law, is unclear, but could be substantial.    Additionally, in January 2010, the Administration announced its intention to propose legislation that would prohibit a bank or financial institution that contains a bank from owning, investing in or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund, or engaging in proprietary trading operations unrelated to serving customers for its own profit. Depending on how it is drafted, this proposal, if enacted, could apply to the Company. The impact, if any, that such an adopted proposal would have on the business, financial condition or results of operation of the Company is unclear. We cannot predict the form in which these proposals will finally be adopted (if at all) or their applicability to or effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.    In addition to these proposals and initiatives in the United States, regulators and law makers around the world are actively reviewing the causes of the financial crisis and exploring steps to avoid similar problems in the future. In many respects, this work is being led by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), consisting of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 nations. The G20 and the FSB have issued a series of papers and recommendations intended to produce significant changes in how financial companies, particularly companies that are members of large and complex financial groups, should be regulated. These proposals address such issues as financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, systemic economic risk, corporate governance including executive compensation, and a host of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis. The law makers and regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions in which we do business have already begun introducing legislative and regulatory changes consistent with G20 and FSB recommendations, including proposals governing consolidated regulation of insurance holding companies by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) in Japan, proposals governing executive compensation by the financial regulators in Germany (BaFIN) and the United Kingdom (FSA), and proposals to permit U.S.-style class action litigation in the United Kingdom with respect to financial services claims.    Changes in U.S. federal income tax law or in the income tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could make some of our products less attractive to consumers and increase our tax costs.     Current U.S. federal income tax laws generally permit certain holders to defer taxation on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products until payments are actually made to the policyholder or other beneficiary and to exclude from taxation the death benefit paid under a life insurance contract. Congress from time to time considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefit of this deferral on some annuities and insurance products, as well as other types of changes that could reduce or eliminate the attractiveness of annuities and life insurance products to consumers, such as repeal of the estate tax.    Under current law, the estate tax is completely eliminated for 2010. Thereafter, the tax is reinstated using the exclusion limit and rates in effect in 2001. It is unclear if Congress will keep current law in place or take action to reinstate the estate tax, possibly retroactively to the beginning of 2010. This uncertainty makes estate planning difficult and may impact sales of our products.    Congress, as well as state and local governments, also considers from time to time legislation that could increase the amount of corporate taxes we pay. For example, changes in the law relating to tax reserving methodologies for term life or universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees or other products could result in higher corporate taxes. If such legislation were adopted, our consolidated net income could decline.    The U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have indicated that they intend to address through regulations the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction, or DRD, related to variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and the expected amount    53    Table of Contents  determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. A change in the DRD, including the possible retroactive or prospective elimination of this deduction through regulations or legislation, could increase our actual tax expense and reduce our consolidated net income.    On February 1, 2010, the Obama Administration released the “General Explanations of the Administration’s Revenue Proposals” or Revenue Proposals. Although the Administration has not released proposed statutory language, the Revenue Proposals” includes proposals which if enacted, would affect the taxation of life insurance companies and certain life insurance products. In particular, the proposals would affect the treatment of corporate owned life insurance policies, or COLIs, by limiting the availability of certain interest deductions for companies that purchase those policies. The proposals would also change the method used to determine the amount of dividend income received by a life insurance company on assets held in separate accounts used to support products, including variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts that are eligible for the DRD. If proposals of this type were enacted, the Company’s sale of COLI, variable annuities, and variable life products could be adversely affected and the Company’s actual tax expense could increase, thereby reducing earnings.    The Revenue Proposals also includes proposals that would change the method by which multinational corporations could claim credits for the foreign taxes they pay and that would change the timing of the deduction for interest expense that is allocable to foreign-source income. More specifically, it is likely that the proposals would impose additional restrictions on the Company’s ability to claim foreign tax credits on un-repatriated earnings. The proposals would also require U.S. multinationals to defer the deduction for interest expense that is allocable to foreign source income until that income is subject to U.S. tax. Unused deductions would be carried forward to future years. If proposals of this type were enacted, the Company’s actual tax expense could increase, thereby reducing earnings.    The federal government currently provides a tax free subsidy to the Company for providing certain retiree prescription drug benefits (the “Medicare Part D subsidy”). Both the House and Senate Finance Committee Health Reform Bills include a provision that would reduce the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent the Company receives a Medicare Part D subsidy. In effect, the provision would make the Medicare Part D subsidy taxable. While the outcome of health care legislation is uncertain, if a proposal of this type were enacted, the Company would incur a one-time charge to reflect the change in law. Thereafter, the Company’s actual tax expense would increase, thereby reducing earnings.    Congress failed to extend a number of tax provisions that expired at the end of 2009. One such provision provides tax deferral for investment income earned by a foreign insurance operation until the income is repatriated to the U.S. Although the President and Congress have indicated an intention to extend retroactively all expired provisions, the failure of Congress to do so will subject the Company to current U.S. tax on investment income earned by its foreign insurance operations in addition to the local jurisdictions’ taxes. If this provision is not extended, the Company’s actual tax expense would increase, thereby reducing earnings.    The large federal deficit, as well as the budget constraints faced by many states and localities, increases the likelihood that Congress and state and local governments will raise revenue by enacting legislation increasing the taxes paid by individuals and corporations. This can be accomplished either by raising rates or otherwise changing the tax rules. While higher tax rates increase the benefits of tax deferral on the build up of value of annuities and life insurance, making our products more attractive to consumers, legislation that reduces or eliminates deferral would have a potential negative effect on our products. In addition, changes in the tax rules that result in higher corporate taxes will increase the Company’s actual tax expense, thereby reducing earnings.    The products we sell have different tax characteristics, in some cases generating tax deductions. The level of profitability of certain of our products are significantly dependent on these characteristics and our ability to continue to generate taxable income, which are taken into consideration when pricing products and are a component of our capital management strategies. Accordingly, a change in tax law, our ability to generate taxable income, or other factors impacting the availability or value of the tax characteristics generated by our products, could impact product pricing and returns or require us to reduce our sales of these products or implement other actions that could be disruptive to our businesses.    54    Table of Contents We have substantial international operations and our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability.    A substantial portion of our revenues and income from continuing operations is derived from our operations outside the U.S., primarily Japan and Korea. These operations are subject to restrictions on transferring funds out of the countries in which these operations are located. Some of our foreign insurance and investment management operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where this risk as well as risks of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’ associations and trade unions, price controls, currency exchange controls, nationalization or expropriation of assets, are heightened. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training our sales force in that country.    Many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at contractually fixed guaranteed interest rates, including in Japan. Actual returns on the underlying investments do not necessarily match the guaranteed interest rates and there may be times when the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is negative and in which this negative spread may not be offset by the mortality, morbidity and expense charges we earn on the products.    Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could increase the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products.    Our international operations are regulated in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. These regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of business operations and adversely affect our liquidity, profitability, and regulatory capital.    Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.    As a U.S.-based company with significant business operations outside the U.S., particularly in Japan, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks that could reduce U.S. dollar equivalent earnings and equity of these operations as well as negatively impact our general account and other proprietary investment portfolios. We seek to mitigate these risks by employing various hedging strategies including entering into derivative contracts and holding U.S. dollar denominated assets within our Japanese subsidiaries. Currency fluctuations, including the effect of changes in the value of U.S. dollar investments that vary from the amounts ultimately needed to hedge our exposure to changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent of earnings and equity of these operations, may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Additionally, U.S. dollar denominated investments held in our Japanese subsidiaries could result, in the event of a significant strengthening of the yen, in additional liquidity or capital needs for our International Insurance operations.    Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.    Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of this regulation is primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, including those to which our international businesses are subject, are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations. This is particularly the case under current market conditions. It appears likely that the continuing financial markets dislocation will lead to extensive changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks, applicable to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally.    Prudential Financial is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE relating to public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate governance matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and regulations adopted in furtherance of that Act have substantially increased the requirements in these and other areas for public companies such as Prudential Financial. Changes in accounting requirements could have an impact on our reported results of operations and our reported financial position.    55    Table of Contents Many insurance regulatory and other governmental or self-regulatory bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of material pending litigation and regulatory matters, see “Legal Proceedings.” Congress from time to time considers pension reform legislation that could decrease the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these products and services. In this regard, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) made significant changes in employer pension funding obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans which are likely to increase sponsors’ costs of maintaining these plans. Over time, these changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other services, but could increase the attractiveness of certain group annuity products we offer in connection with terminating pension plans. Certain tax-favored savings initiatives that have been proposed could hinder sales and persistency of our products and services that support employment based retirement plans.    Insurance regulators, as well as industry participants, have begun to implement significant changes in the way in which statutory reserves and statutory capital are determined particularly for products with embedded options and guarantees, and are considering further potentially significant changes in these requirements. Regulatory capital requirements based on scenario testing have already gone into effect for variable annuity products, and new reserving requirements for these products were implemented as of the end of 2009. The timing and extent of further changes to the statutory reporting framework are uncertain.    The Financial Services Agency, which is the insurance regulator in Japan, recently proposed revisions to the solvency margin requirements which will operate to change the manner in which an insurance company’s core capital will be calculated. Under the proposals, certain financial assets will now be excluded from the core capital calculation and certain investment risk factors, including derivatives and foreign exchange, will be revised. These changes are expected to become effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012; however, it is anticipated that companies may begin to publicly disclose both the old and new solvency margin calculations in the third quarter of 2010. While we believe that the solvency margins of our Japanese insurance subsidiaries would continue to satisfy regulatory requirements, it is possible that a reduction in the reported ratios arising from changes in the calculation requirements could affect our claims paying ratings or customer perception of our financial strength.    As discussed above, governmental actions in response to the recent financial crisis could subject us to substantial additional regulation. Significant regulatory changes are under consideration in the United States as well as in other jurisdiction in response to the crisis.    Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.    See “Business—Regulation” for further discussion of the impact of regulations on our businesses.    Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position or harm our businesses or reputation.    We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our businesses, including in businesses that we have divested or placed in wind-down status. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have an adverse affect on us or cause us reputational harm, which in turn could harm our business prospects.    Material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us, and certain risks to our businesses presented by such matters, are discussed under “Legal Proceedings.” Our litigation and regulatory matters are subject to    56    Table of Contents  many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcome cannot be predicted. Our reserves for litigation and regulatory matters may prove to be inadequate. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flow in a particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of pending litigation and regulatory matters depending, in part, upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period. In light of the unpredictability of the Company’s litigation and regulatory matters, it is also possible that in certain cases an ultimate unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position.    The occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    The occurrence of natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, explosions, pandemic disease and man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition, including in the following respects:        •    Catastrophic loss of life due to natural or man-made disasters could cause us to pay benefits at higher levels and/or materially earlier than anticipated and could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates.        •    A natural or man-made disaster could result in losses in our investment portfolio or the failure of our counterparties to perform, or cause significant volatility in global financial markets.        •    A terrorist attack affecting financial institutions in the United States or elsewhere could negatively impact the financial services industry in general and our business operations, investment portfolio and profitability in particular. As previously reported, in August 2004, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified our Newark, New Jersey facilities, along with those of several other financial institutions in New York and Washington, D.C., as possible targets of a terrorist attack.        •    Pandemic disease, caused by a virus such as H5N1, the “avian flu” virus, or H1N1, the “swine flu” virus, could have a severe adverse effect on Prudential Financial’s business. The potential impact of such a pandemic on Prudential Financial’s results of operations and financial position is highly speculative, and would depend on numerous factors, including: in the case of the avian flu virus, the probability of the virus mutating to a form that can be passed easily from human to human; the effectiveness of vaccines and the rate of contagion; the regions of the world most affected; the effectiveness of treatment for the infected population; the rates of mortality and morbidity among various segments of the insured versus the uninsured population; the collectability of reinsurance; the possible macroeconomic effects of a pandemic on the Company’s asset portfolio; the effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies; and many other variables.    There can be no assurance that our business continuation plans and insurance coverages would be effective in mitigating any negative effects on our operations or profitability in the event of a terrorist attack or other disaster.    Climate change, and its regulation, may affect the prospects of companies and other entities whose securities we hold and other counterparties, including reinsurers, and affect the value of investments, including real estate investments we hold or manage for others. Our initial evaluation is that the near term effects of climate change and climate change regulation on the Company are not material, but we cannot predict the long term impacts on us from climate change or its regulation.    Our risk management policies and procedures and our minority investments in joint ventures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.    Our policies and procedures to monitor and manage risks, including hedging programs that utilize derivative financial instruments, may not be fully effective and may leave us exposed to unidentified and unanticipated risks. The Company uses models in its hedging programs and many other aspects of its operations, including but not limited to the estimation of actuarial reserves, the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the value of business acquired, and the valuation of certain other assets and liabilities. These models rely on assumptions and projections that are inherently uncertain. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among    57    Table of Contents  other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Past or future misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors could result in violations of law by us, regulatory sanctions and/or serious reputational or financial harm and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. A failure of our computer systems or a compromise of their security could also subject us to regulatory sanctions or other claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.    In our investments in which we hold a minority interest, we lack management and operational control over operations, which may prevent us from taking or causing to be taken actions to protect or increase the value of those investments.    We face risks arising from acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, including client losses, surrenders and withdrawals, difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and contingent liabilities with respect to dispositions.    We face a number of risks arising from acquisition transactions, including the risk that, following the acquisition or reorganization of a business, we could experience client losses, surrenders or withdrawals or other results materially different from those we anticipate, as well as difficulties in integrating and realizing the projected results of acquisitions and restructurings and managing the litigation and regulatory matters to which acquired entities are party. We have retained insurance or reinsurance obligations and other contingent liabilities in connection with our divestiture or winding down of various businesses, and our reserves for these obligations and liabilities may prove to be inadequate. These risks may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.    Changes in our discount rate, expected rate of return and expected compensation increase assumptions for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.    We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs based on assumed discount rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs. Changes in these assumptions may result in increased expenses and reduce our profitability.    Our ability to pay shareholder dividends, to engage in share repurchases and to meet obligations may be adversely affected by limitations imposed on inter-affiliate distributions and transfers by Prudential Insurance and our other subsidiaries.    Prudential Financial is the holding company for all our operations, and dividends, returns of capital and interest income from its subsidiaries are the principal source of funds available to Prudential Financial to pay shareholder dividends, to make share repurchases and to meet its other obligations. These sources of funds may be complemented by Prudential Financial’s access, if available, to the financial markets and bank facilities. As described under “Business—Regulation” and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources,” our domestic and foreign insurance and various other subsidiary companies, including Prudential Insurance, are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to Prudential Financial. In addition to these regulatory limitations, the terms of the IHC debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by Prudential Insurance applicable to the Financial Services Businesses in the event the Closed Block Business is in financial distress and under other circumstances. Finally, our management of Prudential Insurance and other subsidiaries to have capitalization consistent with their ratings objectives itself may constrain their payment of dividends. These restrictions on Prudential Financial’s subsidiaries may limit or prevent such subsidiaries from making dividend payments to Prudential Financial in an amount sufficient to fund Prudential Financial’s cash requirements and shareholder dividends. From time to time, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, and various state and foreign insurance regulators have considered, and may in the future consider, proposals to further limit dividend payments that an insurance company may make without regulatory approval.    Difficult market conditions could also affect our ability to pay shareholder dividends. Our practice is to declare and pay dividends annually and the decision concerning Common Stock dividends is ordinarily made in the fourth quarter of the year.    58    Table of Contents Regulatory requirements, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and our shareholder rights plan could delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.    Various states in which our insurance companies are domiciled, including New Jersey, must approve any direct or indirect change of control of insurance companies organized in those states. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. Federal, and in some cases, state, banking authorities would also have to approve the indirect change of control of our banking operations. The federal securities laws could also require reapproval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control. In addition, the New Jersey Business Corporation Act prohibits certain business combinations with interested shareholders. These regulatory and other restrictions may delay a potential merger or sale of Prudential Financial, even if the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interests of shareholders to merge or be sold.    Prudential Financial’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Stock and include: a restriction on the filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors by shareholders; restrictions on the calling of special meetings by shareholders; a requirement that shareholders may take action without a meeting only by unanimous written consent; advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates to the Board of Directors and shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholder meetings; and supermajority voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws. Prudential Financial’s shareholders rights plan also creates obstacles that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests.    Holders of our Common Stock are subject to risks due to the issuance of our Class B Stock, a second class of common stock.    The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, and our Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. There are a number of risks to holders of our Common Stock by virtue of this dual common stock structure, including:        •    Even though we allocate all our consolidated assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flow between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for financial statement purposes, there is no legal separation between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. Holders of Common Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Financial Services Businesses; holders of the Class B Stock have no interest in a separate legal entity representing the Closed Block Business; and therefore holders of each class of common stock are subject to all of the risks associated with an investment in the Company.        •    The financial results of the Closed Block Business, including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs.        •    The market value of our Common Stock may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.        •    We cannot pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for any period if we choose not to pay dividends on the Class B Stock in an aggregate amount at least equal to the lesser of the CB Distributable Cash Flow or the Target Dividend Amount on the Class B Stock for that period. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Convertibility” for the definition of these terms. Any net losses of the Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions on, or repurchases of the Class B Stock, would reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally available for dividends on the Common Stock.        •    Net income for the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business includes general and administrative expenses charged to each of the respective Businesses based on the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Cash flows to the Financial Services Businesses from the Closed Block Business related to administrative expenses are determined by a policy servicing fee    59    Table of Contents       arrangement that is based upon insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. The difference between the administrative expenses allocated to the Closed Block Business and these cash flow amounts are recorded, on an after tax basis, as direct equity adjustments to the equity balances of the businesses and included in the determination of earnings per share for each Business. A change in cash flow amounts between the Businesses that is inconsistent with changes in general and administrative expenses we incur will affect the earnings per share of the Common Stock and Class B Stock.        •    Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock vote together as a single class of common stock under New Jersey law, except as otherwise required by law and except that the holders of the Class B Stock have class voting or consent rights with respect to specified matters directly affecting the Class B Stock.        •    Shares of Class B Stock are entitled to a higher proportionate amount upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Prudential Financial, than shares of Common Stock.        •    We may exchange the Class B Stock for shares of Common Stock at any time, and the Class B Stock is mandatorily exchangeable in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the Closed Block Business or a “change of control” of Prudential Financial. Under these circumstances, shares of Class B Stock would be exchanged for shares of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value equal to 120% of the then appraised “Fair Market Value” of the Class B Stock. For a description of “change of control” and “Fair Market Value,” see “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Convertibility”. Holders of Class B Stock may at their discretion, beginning in 2016, and at any time in the event of specified regulatory events, convert their shares of Class B Stock into shares of Common Stock with an aggregate average market value equal to 100% of the then appraised Fair Market Value of the Class B Stock. Any exchange or conversion could occur at a time when either or both of the Common Stock and Class B Stock may be considered overvalued or undervalued. Accordingly, any such exchange or conversion may be disadvantageous to holders of Common Stock.        •    Our Board of Directors has adopted certain policies regarding inter-business transfers and accounting and tax matters, including the allocation of earnings, with respect to the Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business. Although the Board of Directors may change any of these policies, any such decision is subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties, and we have agreed with investors in the Class B Stock and the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most cases, the Board of Directors may not change these policies without their consent.
