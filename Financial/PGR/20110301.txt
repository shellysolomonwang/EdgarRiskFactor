ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. Management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives:        •    Insurance Risks – risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses of, or liabilities incurred by, policyholders        •    Operating Risks – the risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations        •    Market Risks – changes in the value of invested assets which might result from a variety of factors, including interest rate movements, market price fluctuations, credit spread widening, risk premium pricing, liquidity difficulties, foreign exchange rate changes, and the performance of an individual issuer or a market sector, and        •    Credit Risks – the risks that a counter-party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a contract, as well as our ability to obtain capital when necessary, pay or otherwise satisfy our obligations when due.  Although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. For example, although presented as an Operating Risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our investing and financing activities, which are addressed separately under Market Risks and Credit Risks below. The categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed.  This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time.  It should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. Issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, inflation or deflation, market valuations, interest rates, consumer confidence and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. In that case, the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially.      I. Insurance Risks  Our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders.  Our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. The role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit.  Pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. As a result, our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:        •    the availability of sufficient reliable data        •    uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally        •    our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data        •    our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy        •    our ability to predict changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable accuracy        •    the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies        •    our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations        •    our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis        •    our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately        •    unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory action        •    the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, hail storms, other severe weather, and terrorist events        •    understanding the impact of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices        •    changing driving patterns    11        •    unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs, and        •    unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, and used car prices.  The realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. In either event, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business.  Our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves.  Our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. There is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including:        •    the availability of sufficient, reliable data        •    the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, in multiple markets        •    unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs        •    unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations        •    new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts        •    the effects of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices        •    our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims        •    the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements        •    the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and        •    the accuracy and timeliness of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims.  As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. Consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, or financial position. Further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our “Report on Loss Reserving Practices,” which was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on June 30, 2010.  Our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events.  Catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. The extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. If they occur with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. In addition, changing climate conditions may increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, other storms and fires. We use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposures to such events, but those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that may provide projections that are materially different from the actual events. As a result, increased levels of hurricanes and other storms could have a material adverse effect on our insurance operating results.      II. Operating Risks  We compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive.  We face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. Other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. Many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. Our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses. Competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer. We could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or    12     offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. The automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information technology), pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors.  Historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, which has been defined by periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. This price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market,” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. Unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs, and the expenses to resolve claims) can further reduce profits or result in underwriting losses. As the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a “hard market”) in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels. As more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. In the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. We cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future.  The highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition, or in the failure of one or more competitors. The concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted, but which may or may not be favorable for Progressive’s business prospects at that time. In addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophic fund, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer’s former policyholders, which could strain our service capabilities in the near term.  Our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively, respond to our competitors’ initiatives, and efficiently manage complexity.  From time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. Based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors’, then-current or historical modes of doing business, and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. These innovations may also require extensive modifications to our systems and processes, and thus may add to our costs and entail a degree of complexity and risk that makes their implementation a challenge. In addition, our efforts may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. These initiatives may also disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). Our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition, our business could be materially adversely affected.  At the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. This can include product, pricing, or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technology advances, or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer’s ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, among other initiatives. Our ability to react to such advances and then navigate the new competitive environment is also important to our success.  The fast pace of change and innovation in our businesses, combined with ongoing technological, regulatory, and other developments, results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. The complexity may create a barrier to implementing certain new ideas, and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies, as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources (such as IT resources) for multiple potential initiatives or projects. Our inability to manage this complexity effectively, to bring new ideas to market, to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources, or to prevent errors could result in substantially increased costs, liability to third parties, regulatory investigations and sanctions, poor customer experiences, and damage to our brand.  We must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers.  It is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the Progressive brand. We undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. We believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts, and related expenditures, within the automobile insurance market. If these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected.  Our brand could also be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company. These situations might include, among others, failing to protect sensitive customer information, systems failures, effects of cyber attacks (such as computer hacking, data theft, system disruption, and viruses and malware), errors in handling a customer’s policy, inappropriate handling of    13     claims of policyholders or other parties, inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to systems failures, facility shut-downs or other causes, litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices, and actions by our other business partners, including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products (such as homeowners insurance) and other business partners, and many of the other matters that are discussed in these Risk Factors.  Our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success.  Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. Our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business.  In addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. In either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, and brand could be materially adversely affected.  We further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years. Our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace. In such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins.  The Progressive Corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations.  Progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. In addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. Our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success.  Most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. Our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting, and efforts to freeze, set, or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. Insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders, and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. In addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments arising in a number of circumstances, including to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. Compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. These costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions.  The failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations, or an alleged failure to so comply, by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, or other law enforcement officials. Such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations.  New legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. For example, in 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which, in addition to imposing a number of new compliance obligations on publicly traded companies, created within the United States Department of the Treasury a new Federal Insurance Office (FIO), whose purpose is (in part) to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk. If the FIO were to recommend to the new Financial Stability    14     Oversight Council (also created by the Dodd-Frank Act) that we are “systemically significant” and therefore require additional regulation, or that the insurance industry as a whole should be regulated at the federal level, our businesses could be affected significantly. We are unable to predict whether any additional federal laws or regulations will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses.  Insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. For further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the “Insurance Regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report.  Our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately.  We must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. Many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims, the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of its management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support our claims functions, and the success of our concierge level claims services program. Our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity.  Lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future.  The Progressive Corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations. Other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. These lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the U.S. federal Fair Credit Reporting Act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; challenges to our direct repair program and service center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. From time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, allegations of medical or attorney malpractice, and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. In addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs, and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries’ business operations.  Lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. Moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of court-imposed regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business.  Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability, or financial condition. For further information on pending litigation, see Note 12 – Litigation in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.  Our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions.  Our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions (such as Internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. Our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks (such as computer hacking, data theft, system disruption, and viruses and malware), riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, or interruptions of data processing and storage systems and communications facilities. Likewise, we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded.  The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions. This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.    15    Our business is highly dependent on access to, and the operation of, the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. Disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. A mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments.  A security breach of our computer systems or other operations could also interrupt or damage our operations; infect, corrupt, or destroy data or systems; subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated; and significantly damage our reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, insider threats, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. Any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles. Data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. These standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments. Satisfaction of the PCI standards does not ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis, but it is required to do business with the credit card companies. In September 2010, an independent organization recognized by PCI for such purposes certified Progressive as being in compliance with the current PCI standards. The PCI data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes. Our intention is to maintain compliance with PCI’s data security standards. The failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments.      III. Market Risks  The performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks.  Our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. Our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. The performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including:      •    Interest rate risk – the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates.      •    Investment credit risk – the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease in value due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss.      •    Concentration risk – the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries.      •    Prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) – the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, or that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of, or income from, such securities and the portfolio by investing at less attractive rates.      •    Liquidity risk – the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. Disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us.  In addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. The fixed-income portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: there is a lack of transparency regarding the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions.  The common equity portfolio, which is managed by a third party to track the Russell 1000 Index, is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. An investment that is designed to track an index, such as the Russell 1000, does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. Equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, discussed above. For example, a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall, particularly those of    16     interest-sensitive companies. In addition, even though the Russell 1000 Index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as the financial services industry, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms. A decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital.  Both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets. The functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation:        •    local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, power outages, system failures, wars, or terrorist attacks        •    a recession, depression, or other adverse developments in either the U.S. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolios        •    financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default        •    inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired        •    the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets, or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the failure or refusal of a government to engage in such efforts        •    investor fear, whether substantive or not, causing the market to react irrationally        •    a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation, and        •    a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events  If the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market, sector, or issuer-specific conditions, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. A decrease in value of an insurance company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary’s ability to write new business. If we, at that time, are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from The Progressive Corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2010 and on the market risk associated with our investment portfolio.      IV. Credit Risks  Our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial hardship, or default in the performance of contractual obligations.  Our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements. These include, for example, contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to our operations), agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer, and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). In addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks or other financial institutions. If one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation.  Our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness, or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate.  The Progressive Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to The Progressive Corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts,    17     Progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate. Each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors:        •    Insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus        •    Insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company        •    Competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings        •    In certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company  Further information on insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in Item 5(c), “Dividends,” of this report.  If we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected.  We intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses, and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends, repurchase stock, and fund corporate opportunities. The appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process. The amount of capital that we seek to maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing, and operating risks, including those discussed in these Risk Factors. The estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face. While our techniques for estimating our capital needs are continually enhanced, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size, and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain.  The amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by the performance of our insurance operations and investment results (including investment income, valuation changes in our portfolio, and the realization of any deferred tax benefits), as well as by our capital management activities, such as the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares and debt securities, the establishment of credit lines, and the issuance by us of debt, equity, or other securities. If we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. If our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time, our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are secured. Such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, institutional and other investors, and our customers), and as a result, our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly.  In addition, the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that, in part, depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. Should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels.  Our access to capital markets, ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies.  Our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings, and A.M. Best. Progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. Downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. Perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses, and consumers could also be significantly impaired. In addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral, in cash or high-grade assets, for the benefit of the other party to the transaction. Downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. In any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.  The Progressive Corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed.  We have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the Board of Directors (25% for 2010 and 33-1/3% for    18     2011) and then by the Gainshare factor (determined under our employee Gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). To the extent our after-tax comprehensive income (which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy.  Because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). As a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations. In addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2011 (to be paid early in 2012), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the Board until late 2011 or early 2012, and the Board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2011 or future years. Such an action by the Board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in U.S. federal income tax laws, or disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under “Investing Risks.” Any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares or debt securities.  We do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results.  We believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. We do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. We report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. We also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. As a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors’ expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities.  In addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term performance, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. Such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers, or increases in advertising spend, to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. Consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities.      ITEM 1B.
