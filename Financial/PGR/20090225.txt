ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Progressive’s business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. Management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect our ability to achieve our business objectives:        •    Operating Risks are those stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations.        •    Investing Risks are uncertainties relating to the performance and preservation of our investment portfolios.        •    Financing Risks generally relate to our ability to obtain capital, when necessary, to pay or otherwise perform our obligations, including obligations under any debt instruments issued, and to earn the cost of equity capital.  Although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. For example, although presented as an Operating Risk below, state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our investing and financing activities. Similarly, while setting insurance rates, establishing loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as Operating Risks, errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well. The categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed.  This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time.  It should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. Issues such as unemployment rates, sales of new vehicles, inflation or deflation, stock market valuations, interest rates, consumer confidence and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. In that case, the market price of our common shares could decline materially.      I. Operating Risks  We compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive.  We face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers. Other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. Many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management and sophisticated marketing, underwriting and pricing strategies. Our business focuses on insurance for personal automobiles and recreation vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses. Competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer. We could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. The automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information technology), pricing, and cost control are major competitive factors.  Historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, which has been defined by periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. This price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a “soft market,” can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. Unexpected increases in the insurers’ underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs and the expenses to resolve claims) can further decrease profits or result in underwriting losses. As the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a “hard market”) in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels. As more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. In the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. We cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future.  From time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. Based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors’, then-current or historical modes of doing business, and these changes must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. As such, our innovations may entail a degree of complexity and risk that     11     makes their implementation a challenge, and our efforts may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. In addition, these initiatives may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). Our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, our business could be materially adversely affected.  At the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. This can include product, pricing or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technology advances, or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer’s ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, among other initiatives. Our ability to react to such advances and then navigate the new competitive environment is also important to our success.  We undertake distinctive advertising campaigns, and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers. If these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. We believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market.  The highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors. In the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under state-mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer’s former policyholders.  Our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success.  Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. Our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers with a variety of backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business.  In addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and employment levels accordingly. Our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. In either such event, our financial results and customer relationships could be materially adversely affected.  We further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years. Our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace. In such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins.  The Progressive Corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations.  Progressive’s insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. In addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. Our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success.  Certain states impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to operate, innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. Our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze, set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. Insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries’ ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances or prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders. In addition, laws in certain states mandate that insurance companies pay assessments arising in a number of circumstances, including to pay claims upon the insolvency of     12     other insurance companies or to cover losses in state-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. Compliance with insurance-related laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. These costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions.  In addition, the innovative strategies that we pursue in our efforts to compete may deviate from standard practices in the industry. These innovations often involve significant complexity and, as a result, can be a challenge to implement, requiring us to effectively deploy our management and other resources. This may create the potential for errors or inaccuracies in our implementation of the strategy. If we are alleged to have damaged or otherwise disadvantaged consumers, competitors or other industry participants as a result, we could be subject to regulatory or other official investigations and sanctions, as well as litigation from third parties.  The failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations, or the alleged failure to so comply, by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general or other law enforcement officials. Such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary’s authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. In addition, The Progressive Corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations.  New legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. We are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses.  State insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. For further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the “Insurance Regulation” discussion beginning on page 5 of this report.  Lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future.  The Progressive Corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries’ business operations. Other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. These lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries’ total loss evaluation methodology; use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. From time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries’ business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, allegations of medical and attorney malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. In addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries’ business operations.  Lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. Moreover, as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new layer of court-imposed regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business.  Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability or financial condition. For further information on pending litigation, see Note 12—Litigation in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.  Our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders.  Our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. The role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses and to earn a profit.    13    Pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. As a result, our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:        •    the availability of sufficient reliable data,        •    uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally,        •    our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data,        •    our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy,        •    our ability to predict changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable accuracy,        •    the development, selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies,        •    our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations,        •    our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately,        •    unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action,        •    ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices,        •    changing driving patterns,        •    unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs, and        •    unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices.  The realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. As a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our volume and competitiveness. In either event, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business.  Our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately.  Our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. There is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including:        •    the availability of sufficient reliable data,        •    the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends in multiple markets,        •    unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs,        •    unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations,        •    new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions by courts,        •    inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and changing theories of liability,        •    ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices,        •    the accuracy of our estimates of the frequency or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements,        •    the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and        •    the accuracy of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims.  As a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. Consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. Further information on our loss reserves can be found in the “Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses” discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our “Report on Loss Reserving Practices,” which was filed with the SEC on Form 8-K on June 30, 2008.  Likewise, we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize fraudulent claims, the claims organization’s culture and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our concierge-level claims services program. Our failure to pay claims fairly and accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our financial results, prospects and liquidity.    14    Our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses.  Catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities. The extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. In addition, our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by, or if we were unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of, such an event. Most of our past catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. When they occur with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions, including our information technology and other business systems.  Our business is highly dependent upon our employees’ ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions (such as Internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems for any reason, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded, could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. This could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill.  Our business is highly dependent on access to, and the performance of, the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. Disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. A mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments.  A security breach of our computer systems or other operations could also interrupt or damage our operations; infect, corrupt or destroy data or systems; subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated; and significantly damage our reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. Any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles. Data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. These standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments. In September 2008, an independent organization recognized by PCI for such purposes certified Progressive as being in compliance with the current PCI standards. The PCI data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes. Our intention is to maintain compliance with PCI’s data security standards. The failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments.      II. Investing Risks  The performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks.  Our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. Our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities and preferred stocks. The performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including:      •    Interest rate risk – the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in the market interest rates.      •    Credit risk – the risk that the value of certain investments may become impaired due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those instruments or, in the case of asset-backed     15          securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss.      •    Concentration risk – the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition, performance or outlook of those issuers, sectors or industries.      •    Prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) – the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, or that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of or income from such securities and the portfolio.      •    Liquidity risk – the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on short notice, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. Disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us.  In addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. The fixed-income portfolio’s performance also may be adversely impacted if there is a lack of transparency regarding the businesses of issuers of securities that we purchase, if credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete information or prove unwarranted, or if our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions, among other factors.  The common equity portfolio, which is managed by a third party to track the Russell 1000 index, is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. An investment that is designed to track an index such as the Russell 1000 does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. Equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility and may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, discussed above. For example, a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall, particularly those of interest-sensitive companies. In addition, even though the Russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as the financial services industry, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio when such a sector underperforms. A decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio.  Both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation’s and world’s capital markets. The functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation:        •    local, national or international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks;        •    a recession, depression or other adverse developments in either the U.S. or other economies that adversely affects the value of corporate, municipal and asset-backed securities held in our portfolio;        •    financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default;        •    inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired;        •    the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the government fails or refuses to engage in such efforts;        •    a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation; and        •    a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events.  If the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected. Under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. A decrease in value of an insurance company’s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements. If we, at that time, are unable to supplement the subsidiary’s capital from The Progressive Corporation’s other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected.    16    See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2008 and on the market risk associated with our investment portfolio.  III. Financing Risks  Our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate.  The Progressive Corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to The Progressive Corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, Progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate. Each insurance subsidiary’s ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors:      •    State insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus.      •    State regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company.      •    Competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings.      •    In certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the holding company.  Further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in Item 5(c), “Dividends,” herein.  The Progressive Corporation’s annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed.  We have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the Board of Directors (20% for each of 2008 and 2009) and then by the Gainshare factor (determined under our employee Gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). To the extent our after-tax comprehensive income, which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses, is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be payable. For 2008, this calculation resulted in no dividend being paid to shareholders.  Because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). As a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders’ expectations. In addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2009 (to be paid early in 2010), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the Board until December 2009, and the Board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2009 or future years. Such an action by the Board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in federal income tax laws, or disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under “Investing Risks.” Any such change could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our stock.  Our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent, experiences other financial hardship or defaults in the performance of contractual obligations.  Our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships. These include, for example, contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support, and other services that are integral to our operations), private labeling arrangements and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). In addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, with major banks or other financial institutions. If one or more of these parties were to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses, operational problems and brand risk, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our reputation.    17    If we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected.  We intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, and to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses. The appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level prescribed by management. The amount of capital that we seek to maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing and operating risks, including those discussed in these Risk Factors. The estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types of risks that we are likely to face. While our techniques for estimating our capital needs are continually enhanced, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain.  The amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by the performance of our insurance operations and investing results (including investment income, valuation changes in our portfolio, and the realization of any deferred tax benefits), as well as by our capital management activities, such as the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares, the establishment of credit lines and the issuance by us of debt, equity or other securities. If we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. If our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected and our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found. Such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, and institutional and other investors), and as a result, our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted, and the price of our common shares could fall significantly.  In addition, the recoverability of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on substantial recovery to original cost for our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. Should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels.  Our access to capital markets, our ability to enter into new financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies.  Our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and A.M. Best. Progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. Downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected). Perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. In addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post collateral in amounts then owed to the other party in cash or high grade assets. Downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. In any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.  We do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results.  We believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. We do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. We also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. As a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors’ expectations, which could result in significant volatility in our stock price.  In addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term performance, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. Such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. Consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price.      ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
