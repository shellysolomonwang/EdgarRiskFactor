Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.  Our business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries.  Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, financial condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, are public companies and file reports with the SEC. You are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities.    20    Table of Contents Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation  If CNA determines that its recorded loss reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims, CNA may need to increase its loss reserves.  CNA maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reserves represent CNA’s best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by CNA, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on CNA’s part. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, CNA is sometimes required to add to its reserves. This is called unfavorable net prior year development and results in a charge to earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial.  CNA is also subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves which can have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and equity. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:        •    the effects of recessionary economic conditions, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims due to corporate failures; these claims include both directors and officers (“D&O”) and errors and omissions (“E&O”) insurance claims;        •    class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices; and        •    mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to welding rods, benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals, and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.  In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.  CNA has exposure related to asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”) claims, which could result in additional losses.  CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have exposures related to A&EP claims. CNA’s experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  On August 31, 2010, CNA completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion (“Loss Portfolio Transfer”). If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, CNA’s liabilities for A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4.0 billion, or CNA determines it has exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss    21    Table of Contents  Portfolio Transfer, CNA may need to increase its recorded reserves which would result in a charge against CNA’s earnings. These charges could be substantial.  Catastrophe losses are unpredictable.  Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, and acts of terrorism, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain and snow.  The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas and the frequency and severity of the events themselves. In addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to CNA to be finally determined. As CNA’s claim experience develops on a particular catastrophe, CNA may be required to adjust its reserves, or take unfavorable development, to reflect revised estimates of the total cost of claims.  CNA’s premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.  CNA purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of its business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of its underwriting commitments.  CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers.  CNA has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial condition or have been downgraded by rating agencies. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to it. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due from reinsurers, its incurred losses will be higher.  CNA’s key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings could vary significantly from actual experience.  CNA’s reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remaining in force, interest rates and future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the deferred acquisition cost asset may not be fully realized and the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development.  CNA has incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from volatility in the capital and credit markets.  CNA’s portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit and currency risks, many of which are unpredictable. Investment returns are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability. General economic conditions, changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates, long term periods of low interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodity and stock prices, including the short and long term effects of losses in relation to asset-backed securities, and many other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the value of its investments and the realization of investment income. Further, CNA invests a portion of its assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than its fixed income investments. Limited partnership    22    Table of Contents  investments generally present greater market volatility, higher illiquidity, and greater risk than fixed income investments. As a result of all of these factors, CNA may not realize an adequate return on its investments, may incur losses on sales of its investments, and may be required to write-down the value of its investments.  CNA’s valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment.  CNA exercises significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values, primarily provided by third parties, for securities in its investment portfolio including those that are not regularly traded. CNA also exercises significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary. Securities with exposure to residential and commercial mortgage and other loan collateral can be particularly sensitive to fairly small changes in actual collateral performance and assumptions as to future collateral performance. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of risks and the resulting judgments, CNA may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other-than-temporary write-downs of its investments are required.  CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.  Insurance companies such as CNA are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of CNA’s statutory capital and surplus reported in CNA’s statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the risk-based capital formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, state regulators may restrict or prohibit it from operating its business. If CNA is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances or if it incurs significant unrealized losses related to its investment portfolio, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital. Examples of events leading CNA to record a material charge against earnings include impairment of its investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience.  While we have provided CNA with substantial amounts of capital in prior years. We may be restricted in our ability or may not be willing to provide additional capital support to CNA in the future. If CNA is in need of additional capital, CNA may be required to secure this funding from sources other than us. CNA may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.  CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.  CNA is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary state departments of insurance are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states is the greater of 10.0% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment. Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year’s earned surplus. If CNA is restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, CNA may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.  Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of CNA and thereby adversely affect its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.  Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as CNA’s public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s. Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s or insurance holding company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.    23    Table of Contents Due to the intense competitive environment in which CNA operates, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for CNA to take material unfavorable development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to lower CNA’s ratings in the future. If CNA’s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels, CNA’s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.  In addition, it is possible that a lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s circumstances. CNA has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more than one level below CNA’s current ratings.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide. Worldwide demand for oil and gas, oil and gas prices, market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity. However, higher or lower commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into increased or decreased drilling activity since Diamond Offshore’s customers’ project development time, reserve replacement needs, as well as expectations of future commodity demand and prices all combine to affect demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Oil and gas prices have been, and are expected to continue to be, extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, including:        •    worldwide demand for oil and gas;        •    the level of economic activity in energy-consuming markets;        •    the worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as recessions;        •    the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing;        •    the level of production in non-OPEC countries;        •    the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities in the Middle East, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;        •    civil unrest;        •    the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;        •    the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;        •    the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;        •    available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity;        •    the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;    24    Table of Contents     •    weather conditions in the United States and elsewhere;        •    the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;        •    development and exploitation of alternative fuels;        •    competition for customers’ drilling budgets from land-based energy markets around the world;        •    domestic and foreign tax policy; and        •    advances in exploration and development technology.  The aftermath of the moratorium on offshore drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and new regulations adopted as a result of the investigation into the Macondo well blowout could negatively impact Diamond Offshore.  On April 20, 2010, the Macondo well (operated by BP p.l.c. and drilled by Transocean Ltd) in the GOM experienced a blowout and immediately began flowing oil into the GOM (“the Macondo incident”). Efforts to permanently plug and abandon the well and contain the spill were successfully completed in September 2010. In the near-term aftermath of the Macondo incident, on May 30, 2010, the U.S. government imposed a six-month moratorium on certain drilling activities in water deeper than 500 feet in the GOM and subsequently implemented enhanced safety requirements applicable to all drilling operations in the GOM, including operations in water shallower than 500 feet. On October 12, 2010, the U.S. government lifted the moratorium subject to compliance with enhanced safety requirements including those set forth in Notices to Lessees (“NTL”) 2010-N05 and 2010-N06, both of which were implemented during the drilling ban. Currently, all operations in the GOM are required to comply with the Interim Final Rule to Enhance Safety Measures for Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf (Drilling Safety Rule) and the Workplace Safety Rule on Safety and Environmental Management Systems, both of which were issued on September 30, 2010, as well as NTL 2010-N10 (known as the Compliance and Review NTL). Diamond Offshore continues to evaluate these new measures to ensure that its rigs and equipment are in full compliance, where applicable. Additional requirements could be forthcoming based on further recommendations by regulatory agencies investigating the Macondo incident, as well as restructuring within the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (“BOEMRE”). Diamond Offshore is not able to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of additional rulemaking, nor is Diamond Offshore able to predict when the BOEMRE will issue drilling permits to Diamond Offshore’s customers. Diamond Offshore is not able to predict the future impact of these events on its operations. Even with the drilling ban lifted, requirements regarding certain deepwater drilling activities may remain uncertain until the BOEMRE resumes its regular permitting of those activities.  The current and future regulatory environment in the GOM could result in a number of rigs being, or becoming available to be, moved to locations outside of the GOM, which could potentially put downward pressure on global dayrates and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to contract its floating rigs that are currently not contracted or coming off contract. Additional governmental regulations concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of Diamond Offshore’s operations, and escalating costs borne by its customers, along with permitting delays, could reduce exploration activity in the GOM and therefore demand for Diamond Offshore’s services. In addition, insurance costs across the industry are expected to increase as a result of the Macondo incident, and in the future certain insurance coverage is likely to become more costly, and may become less available or not available at all.  Diamond Offshore’s industry is cyclical.  Diamond Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates followed by periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates. Diamond Offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such business cycles. Periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time. In response to a contraction in demand for its services, Diamond Offshore has cold stacked seven of its rigs as of the date of this report. Diamond Offshore also may be required to idle additional rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash    25    Table of Contents  flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.  Significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling rigs could intensify price competition.  As of the date of this report, based on analyst reports, Diamond Offshore believes that there are approximately 50 jack-up rigs and 50 floaters on order and scheduled for delivery between 2011 and 2013. The resulting increases in rig supply could be sufficient to further depress rig utilization and intensify price competition from both existing competitors, as well as new entrants into the offshore drilling market. As of the date of this report, not all of the rigs currently under construction have been contracted for future work, which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. The majority of the floaters on order are dynamically-positioned drilling rigs, which further increases competition with Diamond Offshore’s fleet in certain circumstances, depending on customer requirements.  Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.  As of February 1, 2011, Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog was approximately $6.6 billion for contracted future work extending, in some cases, until 2016. Generally, contract backlog only includes future revenues under firm commitments; however, from time to time, Diamond Offshore may report anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been, but are expected to be, executed. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that it will be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond its control or that Diamond Offshore will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement in cases where one does not currently exist. In addition, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments. Diamond Offshore’s inability to perform under its contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements or its customers’ inability to fulfill their contractual commitments may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.  Diamond Offshore relies heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer and/or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on its financial results.  Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. However, the number of potential customers has decreased in recent years as a result of mergers among the major international oil companies and large independent oil companies. In 2010, Diamond Offshore’s five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 56.0% of its consolidated revenues. Diamond Offshore expects Petrobras, which accounted for approximately 24.0% of Diamond Offshore’s consolidated revenues in 2010 and OGX, which accounted for approximately 14.0% of Diamond Offshore’s consolidated revenues in 2010, to continue to be significant customers in 2011. Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog, as of the date of this report, includes $1.7 billion, or 61.0% of its contracted backlog for 2011, which is attributable to contracts with Petrobras and OGX for operations offshore Brazil in 2011. While it is normal for Diamond Offshore’s customer base to change over time as work programs are completed, the loss of any major customer may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.  The terms of Diamond Offshore’s dayrate drilling contracts may limit its ability to attain profitability in a declining market or to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market.  The duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and, to a lesser extent, the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractors. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors generally prefer longer term contracts, but often at flat or slightly lower dayrates, to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of lower dayrates. Conversely, in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors typically prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level. An inability to obtain longer term contracts in a declining market or to fully benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market through shorter term contracts may limit Diamond Offshore’s profitability.    26    Table of Contents Contracts for Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability on those contracts.  Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling rigs provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred by Diamond Offshore. Many of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, Diamond Offshore may be unable to recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers.  Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond its control.  Diamond Offshore’s customers may terminate some of their drilling contracts if the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if Diamond Offshore has to suspend drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts. These termination payments may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time. During periods of depressed market conditions, Diamond Offshore may be subject to an increased risk of its customers seeking to repudiate their contracts. Diamond Offshore’s customers’ ability to perform their obligations under drilling contracts may also be adversely affected by restricted credit markets and the economic downturn.  Diamond Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose it to significant losses and significant damage claims. Diamond Offshore is not fully insured against all of these risks and its contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect Diamond Offshore.  Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, unstable or faulty sea floor conditions, fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes. The occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations, and oil spillage, oil leaks, well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled fires, any of which could cause significant environmental damage. In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather.  Diamond Offshore maintains liability insurance, which includes coverage for environmental damage; however, because of contractual provisions and policy limits, its insurance coverage may not adequately cover Diamond Offshore’s losses and claim costs. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable when they are determined to be the result of criminal acts. Also, Diamond Offshore does not typically purchase loss-of-hire insurance to cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to work.  Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages.  Generally Diamond Offshore’s contracts with its customers contain contractual rights to indemnity from its customer for, among other things, pollution originating from the well, while Diamond Offshore retains responsibility for pollution originating from the rig. However, Diamond Offshore’s contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts of commission or omission by Diamond Offshore, its subcontractors and/or suppliers and its customers may dispute, or be unable to meet, their contractual indemnification obligations to Diamond Offshore.  Diamond Offshore believes that the policy limit under its marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of Diamond Offshore’s size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for its business. However, if an accident or other event occurs that exceeds Diamond Offshore’s coverage limits or is not an insurable event under its insurance policies, or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity, it could have a material adverse effect    27    Table of Contents  on Diamond Offshore’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains, that its insurance will cover all types of losses or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will necessarily be financially able to indemnify Diamond Offshore against all of these risks. In addition, no assurance can be made that Diamond Offshore  will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that Diamond Offshore will be able to obtain insurance against some risks.  Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the GOM.  Because the amount of insurance coverage available to Diamond Offshore has been limited, and the cost for such coverage has increased substantially, Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the GOM. This results in a higher risk of losses, which could be material, that are not covered by third party insurance contracts.  A significant portion of Diamond Offshore’s operations are conducted outside the United States and involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations.  Diamond Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world that may expose it to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:        •    terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances;        •    piracy or assaults on property or personnel;        •    kidnapping of personnel;        •    expropriation of property or equipment;        •    renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;        •    changing political conditions;        •    foreign and domestic monetary policies;        •    the inability to repatriate income or capital;        •    difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;        •    fluctuations in currency exchange rates;        •    regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;        •    travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats; and        •    changing taxation policies.  Diamond Offshore is subject to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws and regulations governing its international operations in addition to worldwide anti-bribery laws. In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and regulations relating to:        •    the equipping and operation of drilling rigs;        •    import - export quotas or other trade barriers;    28    Table of Contents     •    repatriation of foreign earnings or capital;        •    oil and gas exploration and development;        •    taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and        •    use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.  Some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors, require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These practices may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete in those regions. It is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete.  As of the date of this report, the greatest concentration of Diamond Offshore’s operating assets outside the United States is in Brazil, where it has 16 rigs in its fleet either currently working or contracted to work during 2011. In addition, as of the date of this report, Diamond Offshore has one high specification floater and two jack-up rigs contracted offshore Egypt. Although these rigs have continued to work throughout the recent political unrest in Egypt, there have been, and in the future there may be other, disruptions to the support networks within Egypt, including the banking institutions.  Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts offshore Mexico expose it to greater risks than they normally assume.  Diamond Offshore currently operates and expects to continue to operate rigs drilling offshore Mexico for PEMEX - Exploracion y Produccion (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico. The terms of these contracts expose Diamond Offshore to greater risks than they normally assume, such as exposure to greater environmental liability. In addition, each contract can be terminated by PEMEX on 30 days notice, contractually or by statute, subject to certain conditions. While Diamond Offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating safeguards in place mitigate these risks, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a negative impact on its future operations or financial results.  Fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses.  Due to Diamond Offshore’s international operations, Diamond Offshore may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not effectively hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. Diamond Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise.  Diamond Offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings.  Certain of Diamond Offshore’s international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited (“DOIL”), a wholly owned Cayman Islands subsidiary of Diamond Offshore. Since forming this subsidiary it has been Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary to finance foreign operations, except for the earnings of Diamond East Asia Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of DOIL. It is Diamond Offshore’s intention to repatriate the earnings of Diamond East Asia Limited, and U.S. income taxes will be provided on such earnings. Diamond Offshore does not expect to provide for U.S. taxes on any future earnings generated by DOIL, except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to U.S. federal income tax or as they relate to Diamond East Asia Limited. Should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary, Diamond Offshore may be required to record additional U.S. income taxes.    29    Table of Contents Rig conversions, upgrades or new builds may be subject to delays and cost overruns.  From time to time, Diamond Offshore may undertake to add new capacity through conversions or upgrades to existing rigs or through new construction. Projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:        •    shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;        •    work stoppages;        •    unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;        •    unanticipated cost increases;        •    weather interferences;        •    difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;        •    design and engineering problems;        •    customer acceptance delays;        •    shipyard failures or unavailability; and        •    failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes.  Failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract, resulting in a loss of revenue to Diamond Offshore. If a drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances, Diamond Offshore may not be able to secure a replacement contract with equally favorable terms.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, HighMount Exploration & Production LLC  HighMount may not be able to replace reserves and sustain production at current levels. Replacing reserves is risky and uncertain and requires significant capital expenditures.  HighMount’s success depends largely upon its ability to find, develop or acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless HighMount replaces the reserves produced through successful development, exploration or acquisition, its proved reserves will decline over time. HighMount may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future or to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs. HighMount makes a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of reserves. HighMount expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from its operating activities. If HighMount’s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund its capital expenditure budget, there can be no assurance that financing will be available or available at favorable terms to meet those requirements.  Estimates of natural gas and NGL reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise.  Estimating the volume of proved natural gas and NGL reserves is a complex process and is not an exact science because of numerous uncertainties inherent in the process. The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.  Actual future production, commodity prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves most likely will vary from HighMount’s estimates. Any significant variance could    30    Table of Contents  materially affect the quantities and present value of HighMount’s reserves. In addition, HighMount may adjust estimates of proved reserves upward or downward to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing commodity prices and prevailing development expenses.  The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and NGL properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10.0% discount factor, used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate representation of their value.  If commodity prices decrease, HighMount may be required to take additional write-downs of the carrying values of its properties.  HighMount may be required, under full cost accounting rules, to write-down the carrying value of its natural gas and NGL properties. A number of factors could result in a write-down, including a significant decline in commodity prices, a substantial downward adjustment to estimated proved reserves, a substantial increase in estimated development costs, or deterioration in exploration results. HighMount utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities. Under full cost accounting, HighMount is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or “ceiling,” of the book value of HighMount’s natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value (discounted at the required rate of 10.0%) of the future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges, calculated using the average first day of the month price for the preceding 12-month period.  If the net book value of HighMount’s exploration and production (“E&P”) properties (reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability) exceeds its ceiling limitation, HighMount will impair or “write-down” the book value of its E&P properties. A write-down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and NGL prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Depending on the magnitude of any future impairment, a ceiling test write-down could significantly reduce HighMount’s income, or produce a loss.  Natural gas, NGL and other commodity prices are volatile.  The commodity price HighMount receives for its production heavily influences its revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. HighMount is subject to risks due to frequent and possibly substantial fluctuations in commodity prices. NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and HighMount expects this volatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond HighMount’s control. These factors include, among others, economic and market conditions, domestic production and import levels, storage levels, basis differentials, weather, government regulations and taxation. Lower commodity prices may decrease HighMount’s revenues and reduce the amount of natural gas and NGLs that HighMount can produce economically.  HighMount engages in commodity price hedging activities.  The extent of HighMount’s commodity price risk is related to the effectiveness and scope of HighMount’s hedging activities. To the extent HighMount hedges its commodity price risk, HighMount will forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in its favor. Furthermore, because HighMount has entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of its natural gas and NGL production, HighMount will continue to have direct commodity price risk on the unhedged portion. HighMount’s actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than HighMount estimates at the time it enters into derivative transactions for that period.  As a result, HighMount’s hedging activities may not be as effective as HighMount intends in reducing the volatility of its cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of cash flows. In addition, even though HighMount’s management monitors its hedging activities, these activities can result in substantial losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement or if the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective.    31    Table of Contents Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP  Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long term basis.  Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to market risk when its transportation contracts expire and need to be renewed or replaced. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or on a long term basis. Key drivers that influence the rates and terms of Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation contracts include the current and anticipated basis differentials between physical locations on its pipeline systems, which can be affected by, among other things, the availability and supply of natural gas, competition from other pipelines, including pipeline under development, available capacity, storage inventories, regulatory developments, weather and general market demand in the respective areas. The new sources of natural gas that have been identified throughout the U.S. have created changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins, pooling points and market areas. As a result of the increase in overall pipeline capacity and the new sources of supply, in 2009 basis spreads on Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems began to narrow. Basis spreads have impacted, and will continue to impact, the rates Boardwalk Pipeline has been able to negotiate with its customers on contracts due for renewal for firm transportation services, as well as the rates it can charge for interruptible and short term firm transportation services.  The principal elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. FERC’s policies promote competition in natural gas markets by increasing the number of gas transportation options available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customer base. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems or, in instances where Boardwalk Pipeline does not have long term contracts with fixed rates, could cause Boardwalk Pipeline to decrease transportation or storage rates charged to its customers. Competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that could significantly decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries, such as a recession or adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas.  Boardwalk Pipeline needs to maintain authority from PHMSA to operate portions of its pipeline systems at higher than normal operating pressures.  Boardwalk Pipeline has entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers which utilize the maximum design capacity of certain of its pipeline assets, assuming that Boardwalk Pipeline operates those pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures (up to 0.80 SMYS). Boardwalk Pipeline has authority from PHMSA to operate those pipeline assets at such higher pressures, however, PHMSA retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. If PHMSA were to withdraw or materially modify such authority, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas and could incur significant additional costs to re-obtain such authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to FERC’s rate-making policies which could limit Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.  Boardwalk Pipeline is subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates it can charge for its transportation and storage operations. For cost-based services, FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge. The basic elements that FERC considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. While neither Gulf South nor Texas Gas has an obligation to file a rate case, Gulf Crossing Pipeline has an obligation to file either a rate case or a cost-and-revenue study by the end of the first quarter of 2012 to justify its rates. Customers of Boardwalk Pipeline’s subsidiaries or FERC can challenge the existing rates on any of its pipelines. During the past two years FERC has challenged the rates of several pipelines not affiliated with Boardwalk Pipelines. Such a challenge against Boardwalk Pipeline could adversely affect its ability to establish reasonable transportation rates, to charge rates that would cover future increases in Boardwalk Pipeline’s costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return.    32    Table of Contents If Boardwalk Pipeline were to file a rate case or defend its rates in a proceeding commenced by a customer or FERC, Boardwalk Pipeline would be required, among other things, to establish that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in Boardwalk Pipeline’s cost of service is just and reasonable. Under current FERC policy, since Boardwalk Pipeline is a limited partnership and does not pay U.S. federal income taxes, this would require Boardwalk Pipeline to show that its unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to federal income taxation. To support such a showing, Boardwalk Pipeline’s general partner may elect to require owners of Boardwalk Pipeline’s units to re-certify their status as being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline or may attempt to provide other evidence. Boardwalk Pipeline can provide no assurance that the evidence it might provide to FERC will be sufficient to establish that its unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to U.S. federal income tax liability on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline’s jurisdictional pipelines. If Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to make such a showing, FERC could disallow a substantial portion of the income tax allowance included in the determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline, which could result in a reduction of such maximum rates from current levels. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to recover all of its costs through existing or future rates.  Continued development of new supply sources could impact demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services.  Supplies of natural gas in production areas that are closer to key end-user market areas than Boardwalk Pipeline’s supply sources may compete with gas originating in production areas connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s system. For example, the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia and Ohio, may cause gas in supply areas connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s system to be diverted to markets other than Boardwalk Pipeline’s traditional market areas and may adversely affect capacity utilization on Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems and its ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows. In addition, natural gas supplies from the Rocky Mountains, Canada and liquefied natural gas import terminals may compete with and displace volumes from the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent supply sources where Boardwalk Pipeline is located, which could reduce Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation volumes and the rates it can charge for its services.  Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers.  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Boardwalk Pipeline’s exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by Boardwalk Pipeline to them under certain no-notice and parking and lending services. FERC gas tariffs only allow Boardwalk Pipeline to require limited credit support in the event that transportation customers are unable to pay for its services. If any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by Boardwalk Pipeline or contracted for with Boardwalk Pipeline, or to repay the gas they owe Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s business. In addition, as contracts expire, the failure of any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers could also result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity.  Boardwalk Pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues. The loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues.  Boardwalk Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline’s largest customer in terms of revenue, Devon Gas Services, LP represented over 13.0% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s 2010 revenues and Boardwalk Pipeline expects this customer to continue to account for more than 10.0% of its 2011 revenues. For 2010, Boardwalk Pipeline’s top ten customers comprised approximately 45.0% of its revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts with key customers on favorable terms which could materially reduce its contracted transportation volumes and the rates it can charge for its services.  Boardwalk Pipeline may pursue complex pipeline or storage projects which involve significant risks.  The most significant element of Boardwalk Pipeline’s growth strategy in recent years was the completion of large development projects to enlarge and enhance its pipeline and storage systems. Boardwalk Pipeline may undertake additional large development projects in the future as it continues to pursue its growth strategy. The successful completion of such projects, and the returns Boardwalk Pipeline may realize from those projects after completion, are subject to many significant risks, including cost overruns, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, difficult construction conditions, including adverse weather conditions, delays in obtaining key materials, shortages of qualified labor, and    33    Table of Contents  escalating costs of labor and materials, particularly in the event there is a high level of construction activity in the pipeline industry at that time. As a result, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to complete future projects on the expected terms, cost or schedule, or at all. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline cannot be certain that, if completed, it will be able to operate these projects, or that they will perform in accordance with expectations. Other areas of Boardwalk Pipeline’s business may suffer as a result of the diversion of management’s attention and other resources from other business concerns. Any of these factors could impair Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to realize the benefits anticipated from the projects.  Significant changes in energy prices could affect natural gas market supply and demand, or potentially reduce the competitiveness of natural gas compared with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, which could reduce system throughput and adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues and available cash.  Due to the natural decline in traditional gas production connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s system, Boardwalk Pipeline’s success depends on its ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas, which is dependent on factors beyond its control including the price level of natural gas. In general terms, the price of natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors, including:        •    economic conditions;        •    weather conditions, seasonal trends and hurricane disruptions;        •    new supply sources;        •    the availability of adequate transportation capacity;        •    storage inventory levels;        •    the price and availability of other forms of energy;        •    the effect of energy conservation measures;        •    the nature and extent of, and changes in, governmental regulation, for example greenhouse gas legislation and taxation; and        •    the anticipated future prices of natural gas and other commodities.  It is difficult to predict future changes in gas prices. However, the abundance of natural gas supply discoveries over the last few years would generally indicate a bias toward downward pressure on prices. Downward movement in gas prices could negatively impact producers in nontraditional supply areas such as the Barnett Shale, the Bossier Sands, the Caney Woodford Shale, the Fayetteville Shale and the Haynesville Shale, including producers who have contracted for capacity with Boardwalk Pipeline. Significant financial difficulties experienced by Boardwalk Pipeline’s producer customers could impact their ability to pay for services rendered or otherwise reduce their demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services.  High natural gas prices may result in a reduction in the demand for natural gas. A reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, reduce the demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services and could result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally  In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, terrorism, hurricanes and other natural disasters, competition, government regulation, dependence on key executives and employees, litigation, dependence on information technology and compliance with environmental laws.    34    Table of Contents Acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.  Future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad, as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on the assets and businesses of certain of our subsidiaries. CNA issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act. Terrorist acts or the threat of terrorism, including increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of oil and gas, could affect the market for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services, Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation, gathering and storage services and HighMount’s exploration and production activities. In addition, future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to secure their assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.  Our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations.  The businesses operated by our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal, state and local governmental regulations which impose or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies. Governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies. Risks faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following:  CNA. The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders rather than its investors. Each state in which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate its business, including:        •    standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;        •    restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;        •    restrictions on CNA’s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas;        •    the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;        •    the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;        •    potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;        •    licensing of insurers and agents;        •    approval of policy forms;        •    limitations on the ability of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and        •    limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.  Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. CNA also is required by the states to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and is generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.  Diamond Offshore. The drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or may significantly limit drilling activity.      35    Table of Contents Governments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s operations by limiting drilling opportunities.  HighMount. All of HighMount’s operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among other things: permits to drill and to conduct other operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area); the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties; maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells; venting or flaring of natural gas and the ratability of production.  The conference committee report for The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requested the EPA to conduct a study of hydraulic fracturing, particularly the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. Hydraulic fracturing is a technique commonly used by oil and gas exploration companies, including HighMount, to stimulate the production of oil and natural gas by injecting fluids and sand into underground wells at high pressures, causing fractures or fissures in the geological formation which allow oil and gas to flow more freely. In recent years, concerns have been raised that the fracturing process may contaminate underground sources of drinking water. Several bills were introduced in the 111th Congress seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, which has historically been regulated at the state level, though none of the proposed legislation was passed into law. Indications are that similar bills will be introduced in the new Congress. If hydraulic fracturing is banned or significantly restricted by federal regulation or otherwise, it could impair HighMount’s ability to economically drill new natural gas wells, which would reduce its production, revenues and profitability.  Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by FERC and the DOT among other federal and state authorities. In addition to FERC rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its services, federal regulations extend to pipeline safety, operating terms and conditions of service, the types of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer, construction or abandonment of facilities, accounting and record keeping, and relationships and transactions with affiliated companies. These regulations can adversely impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, including by increasing the lead times to develop projects, offer new services, or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines.  Our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.  Our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and/or financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, many of which have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose “strict liability,” which could be substantial, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. For example, Diamond Offshore could be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to its operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by others. HighMount is also subject to extensive environmental regulation in the conduct of its business, particularly related to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination.  We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.  As awareness of climate change issues increases, governments around the world are beginning to address the matter. This may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our subsidiaries and their suppliers and customers. We and our subsidiaries may be exposed to risks related to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas, thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel and related services provided by our energy subsidiaries. Governments also may pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which    36    Table of Contents  may reduce demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, changing global weather patterns have been associated with extreme weather events and could change longer-term natural catastrophe trends, including increasing the frequency and severity of hurricanes and other natural disasters which could increase future catastrophe losses at CNA and damage to property, disruption of business and higher operating costs at Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk Pipeline, HighMount and Loews Hotels.  There is currently no federal regulation that limits GHG emissions in the U.S. However, several bills were introduced in Congress in recent years that would regulate U.S. GHG emissions under a cap and trade system. Although these bills were not passed into law, some regulation of that type may be enacted in the U.S. in the near future. In addition, in 2009, the EPA adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual GHG emissions by operators of facilities that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of GHG per year, which includes Boardwalk Pipeline and HighMount. Numerous states and several regional multi-state climate initiatives have announced or adopted plans to regulate GHG emissions, though the state programs vary widely. The establishment of a GHG reporting system and registry may be a first step toward broader regulation of GHG emissions. Compliance with future laws and regulations could impose significant costs on affected companies or adversely affect the demand for and the cost to produce and transport hydrocarbon-based fuel, which would adversely affect the businesses of our energy subsidiaries.  We could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long-lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries.  Our subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Most notably, we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of offshore drilling equipment at Diamond Offshore, natural gas and oil properties at HighMount, pipeline equipment at Boardwalk Pipeline and hotel properties owned by Loews Hotels.  We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting units and estimate each unit’s fair value as of the testing date. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units (each of our principal operating subsidiaries) based on estimates of future discounted cash flows, which reflect management’s judgments and assumptions regarding the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, future industry conditions and operations and other factors. Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.  We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.  We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies, and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders.  We could have liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.  As a result of our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”) prior to the separation of Lorillard from us in 2008 (the “Separation”), from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits. We are currently a defendant in three such lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the Separation. In the Separation Agreement entered into between us and Lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business, including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. An adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material    37    Table of Contents  adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and equity. We do not expect that the Separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity with respect to tobacco-related claims. We do not believe that we have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims. Additional information on the Separation is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
