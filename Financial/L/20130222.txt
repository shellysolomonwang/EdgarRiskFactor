Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.  Our business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries.  Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, financial condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, are public companies and file reports with the SEC. You are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation  If CNA determines that its recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, CNA may need to increase its insurance reserves.  CNA maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reserves represent CNA’s best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by CNA, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claims handling, case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Mortality is the relative incidence of death. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant judgment on CNA’s part. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, CNA is sometimes required to add to its reserves. This is called unfavorable net prior year    22    Table of Contents  development and results in a charge to earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial.  CNA is also subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:        —    the effects of worldwide economic conditions, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of certain claims including both directors and officers (“D&O”) and errors and omissions (“E&O”) insurance claims related to corporate failures, as well as other coverages;        —    class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices; and        —    mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to welding rods, benzene, lead, noise induced hearing loss, injuries from various medical products including pharmaceuticals, and various other chemical and radiation exposure claims.  In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.  CNA’s key assumptions used to determine reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts could vary significantly from actual experience.  CNA’s reserves for long term care products and payout annuity contracts are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity, mortality, policy persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force) and discount rates (which are impacted by expected investment yields). A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in CNA’s reserving may result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting policy obligations, which may require changes to reserves. These assumptions, while based on historical data and industry experience and monitored consistently, are critical bases for reserve estimates and are inherently uncertain. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.  Catastrophe losses are unpredictable and could result in material losses.  Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, and acts of terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.  The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance assumed and ceded and reinsurance reinstatement premiums, if any. As in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to CNA to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, additional living expenses, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility. Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited    23    Table of Contents  circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. As a result, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate.  As CNA’s claim experience develops on a specific catastrophe, CNA may be required to adjust its reserves, or take unfavorable net prior year development, to reflect revised estimates of the total cost of claims.  CNA has exposure related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses.  CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims. CNA’s experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  On August 31, 2010, CNA completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion (“Loss Portfolio Transfer”). If the other parties to the Loss Portfolio Transfer do not fully perform their obligations, CNA’s liabilities for A&EP claims covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4.0 billion, or CNA determines it has exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the Loss Portfolio Transfer, CNA may need to increase its recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against CNA’s earnings. These charges could be substantial.  CNA’s premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.  CNA purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of its business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost it deems acceptable, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of its underwriting commitments.  CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers which could result in higher net incurred losses.  CNA has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. In the past, certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have experienced credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of CNA’s contractual relationship. Such action increases the likelihood that CNA will not be able to recover amounts due. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to it. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due from reinsurers for any of the foregoing reasons, its net incurred losses will be higher.  CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by policyholders who hold deductible policies which could result in higher net incurred losses.  A portion of CNA’s business is written under deductible policies. Under these policies, CNA is obligated to pay the related insurance claims and are reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant. As a result CNA is exposed to credit risk to the policyholder. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due from policyholders, its incurred losses will be higher.    24    Table of Contents CNA has incurred and may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from volatility in the capital and credit markets.  CNA’s investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit and currency risks, many of which are unpredictable. Investment returns are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability. General economic conditions, changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodity and stock prices, and many other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the value of its investments and the realization of investment income. Further, CNA invests a portion of its assets in equity securities and limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than its fixed income investments. In addition, limited partnership investments generally present, higher illiquidity than fixed income investments. As a result of all of these factors, CNA may not realize an adequate return on its investments, may incur losses on sales of its investments, and may be required to write-down the value of its investments.  CNA’s valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment which is inherently uncertain.  CNA exercises significant judgment in analyzing and validating fair values, which are primarily provided by third parties, for securities in its investment portfolio including those that are not regularly traded in active markets. CNA also exercises significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary. The valuation of residential and commercial mortgage and other asset backed securities can be particularly sensitive to fairly small changes in collateral performance. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these judgments, CNA may incur unrealized losses and conclude that other-than-temporary write-downs of its investments are required.  CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.  Insurance companies such as CNA are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of statutory capital and surplus reported in CNA’s statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets such as Lloyd’s, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable regulatory capital adequacy formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, CNA may be restricted or prohibited from operating its business. If CNA is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or the occurrence of an event or if it incurs significant losses related to its investment portfolio, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital.  While we have provided CNA with substantial amounts of capital in prior years, we may be restricted in our ability or may not be willing to provide additional capital support to CNA in the future. If CNA is in need of additional capital, CNA may be required to secure this funding from sources other than us. CNA may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.  CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.  CNA is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formula which varies by jurisdiction. The formula for the majority of domestic states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment. Some jurisdictions including certain domestic states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year’s earned surplus. If CNA is restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, CNA may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.    25    Table of Contents Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of CNA and thereby adversely affect its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.  Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as CNA’s public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”). Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s or insurance holding company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.  Due to the intense competitive environment in which CNA operates, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for CNA to take material unfavorable net prior year development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to lower CNA’s ratings in the future. If CNA’s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings are downgraded below current levels, CNA’s business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.  In addition, it is possible that a lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s circumstances. CNA has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more than one level below CNA’s current ratings.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide. Worldwide demand for oil and gas, oil and gas prices, market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity. However, higher or lower commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into increased or decreased drilling activity since Diamond Offshore’s customers’ project development time, reserve replacement needs, as well as expectations of future commodity demand and prices all combine to affect demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Oil and gas prices have been, and are expected to continue to be, extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, including:        —    worldwide demand for oil and gas;        —    the level of economic activity in energy-consuming markets;        —    the worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as recessions;        —    the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing;        —    the level of production in non-OPEC countries;        —    the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities in the Middle East, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;    26    Table of Contents     —    civil unrest;        —    the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;        —    the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;        —    the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;        —    available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation and refining capacity;        —    the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;        —    weather conditions;        —    natural disasters or incidents resulting from operating hazards inherent in offshore drilling, such as oil spills;        —    the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;        —    development and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources;        —    competition for customers’ drilling budgets from land-based energy markets around the world;        —    domestic and foreign tax policy; and        —    advances in exploration and development technology.  Diamond Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose it to significant losses and significant damage claims. Diamond Offshore is not fully insured against all of these risks and its contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect Diamond Offshore.  Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, unstable or faulty sea floor conditions, fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes. The occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations, and oil spillage, oil leaks, well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled fires, any of which could cause significant environmental damage. In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages.  Consistent with industry practice, Diamond Offshore’s contracts with its customers generally contain contractual rights to indemnity from its customer for, among other things, pollution originating from the well, while Diamond Offshore retains responsibility for pollution originating from the rig. However, Diamond Offshore’s contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts of commission or omission by itself, its subcontractors and/or suppliers and Diamond Offshore’s customers may dispute, or be unable to meet, their contractual indemnification obligations.  Diamond Offshore maintains liability insurance, which includes coverage for environmental damage; however, because of contractual provisions and policy limits, Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage may not adequately cover its losses and claim costs. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable when they are determined to be the result of criminal acts. Also, Diamond Offshore does not typically purchase loss-of-hire insurance to cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to work. Moreover, insurance costs across the industry have increased following the Macondo incident and, in the future, certain insurance coverage is likely to become more costly and may become less available or not available at all.    27    Table of Contents Diamond Offshore believes that the policy limit under its marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of its size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for its business. However, if an accident or other event occurs that exceeds Diamond Offshore’s coverage limits or is not an insurable event under its insurance policies, or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity, it could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains, that its insurance will cover all types of losses or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will necessarily be financially able to indemnify Diamond Offshore against all of these risks. In addition, no assurance can be made that Diamond Offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that Diamond Offshore will be able to obtain insurance against some risks.  Diamond Offshore’s industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.  The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than it does. The drilling industry has experienced consolidation in the past and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job; however, rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered.  Diamond Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates, followed by periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates. Diamond Offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such business cycles. Periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.  Significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling rigs could also intensify price competition. Based on analyst reports, Diamond Offshore believes that there are approximately 67 floaters on order and scheduled for delivery between 2013 and 2016, with approximately 75% of these rigs scheduled for delivery in 2013 and 2014. The resulting increases in rig supply could be sufficient to depress rig utilization and intensify price competition from both existing competitors, as well as new entrants into the offshore drilling market. Not all of the rigs currently under construction have been contracted for future work, which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. The majority of the floaters on order are dynamically positioned drilling rigs, which further increases competition with Diamond Offshore’s fleet in certain circumstances, depending on customer requirements. In Brazil, Petrobras, which accounted for approximately 33% of Diamond Offshore’s consolidated revenues in 2012 and, as of February 1, 2013, accounted for approximately $2.6 billion of contract drilling backlog through 2016 and to which nine of Diamond Offshore’s floaters are currently contracted, has announced plans to construct locally 29 new ultra-deepwater drilling units to be delivered beginning in 2015. These new drilling rigs, if built, would increase rig supply and could intensify price competition in Brazil as well as other markets as they enter the market, would compete with, and could displace, Diamond Offshore’s deepwater and ultra-deepwater floaters coming off contract and could materially adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s utilization rates, particularly in Brazil.  Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.  As of February 1, 2013, Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog was approximately $8.6 billion for contracted future work extending, in some cases, until 2019. Generally, contract backlog only includes future revenues under firm commitments; however, from time to time, Diamond Offshore may report anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been, but are expected to be, executed. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that it will be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond its control or that Diamond Offshore will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement in cases where one does not currently exist. In addition, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its customers will be able to or    28    Table of Contents  willing to fulfill their contractual commitments. Diamond Offshore’s inability to perform under its contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements or its customers’ inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.  Diamond Offshore relies heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer and/or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have a material adverse impact on its financial results.  Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. In 2012, Diamond Offshore’s five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 62% of its consolidated revenues. Diamond Offshore expects Petrobras and OGX, which accounted for approximately 33% and 12% of Diamond Offshore’s consolidated revenues in 2012, to continue to be significant customers in 2013. Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog, as of February 1, 2013, includes $1.0 billion, or 36% and $187 million or 7% of its contracted backlog for 2013, which is attributable to contracts with Petrobras and OGX for operations offshore Brazil. Petrobras has announced plans to construct locally, 29 new ultra-deepwater drilling units to be delivered beginning in 2015. These new drilling units, if built, would compete with, and could displace, Diamond Offshore’s deepwater and ultra-deepwater floaters coming off contract and could materially adversely affect utilization rates, particularly in Brazil. While it is normal for Diamond Offshore’s customer base to change over time as work programs are completed, the loss of, or a significant reduction in the number of rigs contracted with, any major customer may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.  The terms of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may limit its ability to attain profitability in a declining market or to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market.  The duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and, to a lesser extent, the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractors. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors generally prefer longer term contracts, but often at flat or slightly lower dayrates, to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of lower dayrates. Conversely, in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors typically prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level. An inability to obtain longer term contracts in a declining market or to fully benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market through shorter term contracts may limit Diamond Offshore’s profitability.  Contracts for Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability on those contracts.  Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling rigs provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred by Diamond Offshore. Many of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, Diamond Offshore may be unable to fully recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers.  Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond its control.  Diamond Offshore’s customers may terminate some of their term drilling contracts if the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if Diamond Offshore has to suspend drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts. These termination payments may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time. During periods of depressed market conditions, Diamond Offshore may be subject to an increased risk of its customers seeking to repudiate their contracts. Diamond Offshore’s    29    Table of Contents  customers’ ability to perform their obligations under drilling contracts may also be adversely affected by restricted credit markets and economic downturns. If Diamond Offshore’s customers cancel some of their contracts, and Diamond Offshore is unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are disputed or suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of contracts are renegotiated, it could materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Significant portions of Diamond Offshore’s operations are conducted outside the United States and involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations.  Diamond Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world which may expose it to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:        —    war and civil disturbances;        —    piracy or assaults on property or personnel;        —    kidnapping of personnel;        —    expropriation or nationalization of property or equipment;        —    renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;        —    changing political conditions;        —    imposition of trade barriers or import-export quotas;        —    foreign and domestic monetary policies;        —    the inability to repatriate income or capital;        —    difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;        —    fluctuations in currency exchange rates;        —    regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;        —    travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats;        —    difficulties in supplying, repairing or replacing equipment or transporting personnel in remote locations;        —    difficulties in obtaining visas or work permits for employees on a timely basis; and        —    changing taxation policies.  Diamond Offshore is subject to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws and regulations governing its international operations in addition to worldwide anti-bribery laws. In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and regulations relating to:        —    the equipping and operation of drilling rigs;        —    import - export quotas or other trade barriers;        —    repatriation of foreign earnings or capital;        —    oil and gas exploration and development;        —    taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and    30    Table of Contents     —    use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.  Some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors, require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These practices may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete in those regions. It is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments may materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete.  In addition, the shipment of goods, including the movement of a drilling rig across international borders, subjects Diamond Offshore to extensive trade laws and regulations. Diamond Offshore’s import activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations that differ in each of the countries in which Diamond Offshore operates and often impose record keeping and reporting obligations. The laws and regulations concerning import/export activity and record keeping and reporting requirements are complex and change frequently. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended enforced and/or interpreted in a manner that could materially and adversely impact Diamond Offshore’s operations. Shipments can be delayed and denied export or entry for a variety of reasons, some of which may be outside of Diamond Offshore’s control. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled downtime for rigs. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil penalties, economic sanctions, seizure of shipments and/or the contractual withholding of monies owed to Diamond Offshore, among other things.  Diamond Offshore may enter into drilling contracts that exposes it to greater risks than it normally assumes.  From time to time, Diamond Offshore may enter into drilling contracts with national oil companies, government-controlled entities or others that expose it to greater risks than it normally assumes, such as exposure to greater environmental or other liability and more onerous termination provisions giving the customer a right to terminate without cause or upon little or no notice. Upon termination, these contracts may not result in a payment to Diamond Offshore, or if a termination payment is required, it may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time. For example, Diamond Offshore currently operates, and expects to continue to operate, its drilling rigs offshore Mexico for PEMEX – Exploración y Producción (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico. The terms of these contracts expose Diamond Offshore to greater environmental liability than it normally assumes, and provide that, among other things, each contract can be terminated by PEMEX on short notice, contractually or by statute, subject to certain conditions. While Diamond Offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating safeguards in place mitigate these risks, it can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a material negative impact on future operations or financial results.  Fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses.  Due to Diamond Offshore’s international operations, Diamond Offshore may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not effectively hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. Diamond Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise.  Diamond Offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings.  Certain of Diamond Offshore’s international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited (“DOIL”), a wholly owned Cayman Islands subsidiary of Diamond Offshore. It is Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest future earnings of DOIL and its foreign subsidiaries to finance foreign activities. Diamond Offshore does not expect to provide for U.S. taxes on any future earnings generated by DOIL, except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to U.S. federal income tax. Should a future    31    Table of Contents  distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary, Diamond Offshore may be required to record additional U.S. income taxes.  Rig conversions, upgrades or new builds may be subject to delays and cost overruns.  From time to time, Diamond Offshore adds new capacity through conversions or upgrades to existing rigs or through new construction, such as its four, ultra-deepwater drillships under construction and its construction of the Ocean Apex and Ocean Onyx. Projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:        —    shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;        —    work stoppages;        —    unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;        —    unanticipated cost increases;        —    weather interferences or storm damage;        —    difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;        —    design and engineering problems;        —    availability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations;        —    customer acceptance delays;        —    shipyard failures or unavailability; and        —    failure or delay of third party service providers, civil unrest and labor disputes.  Failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract, resulting in a loss of contract drilling backlog and revenue to Diamond Offshore. If a drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances, Diamond Offshore may not be able to secure a replacement contract with equally favorable terms.  Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the GOM.  Because the amount of insurance coverage available to Diamond Offshore has been limited, and the cost for such coverage is substantial, Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the GOM. This results in a higher risk of losses, which could be material, that are not covered by third party insurance contracts.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP  Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis.  Each year, a portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation contracts expire and need to be renewed or replaced. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at attractive rates or for the same term as the expiring contracts. A key driver that influences the rates and terms of its transportation contracts is the current and anticipated basis spreads - generally meaning the difference in the price of natural gas at receipt and delivery points on its natural gas pipeline systems which influence how much    32    Table of Contents  customers are willing to pay to transport gas between those points. Basis differentials can be affected by, among other things, the availability and supply of natural gas, competition from other pipelines, including pipelines under development, available transportation and storage capacity, storage inventories, regulatory developments, weather and general market demand in markets served by its pipeline systems. As new sources of natural gas have been identified and developed, changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins, pooling points and market areas have occurred. As a result of the increase in overall pipeline capacity and the new sources of supply, basis spreads on its pipeline systems have narrowed over the past several years, reducing the transportation rates Boardwalk Pipeline can negotiate with its customers on contracts due for renewal for its firm transportation services. The narrowing of basis differentials has also adversely affected the rates it is able to charge for its interruptible and short term firm transportation services. As a result, the rates Boardwalk Pipeline is able to obtain on renewals of expiring contracts are generally lower than those under the expiring contracts, which adversely impacts its revenues and distributable cash.  The development of large new gas supply basins in the U.S. and the overall increase in the supply of natural gas created by such development can significantly affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s business.  Growing supplies of natural gas are being produced in new production areas that are not connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s system and are closer to large end-user market areas than the supply basins connected to its system that traditionally served these markets. For example, gas produced in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia and Ohio is being shipped to nearby northeast markets such as New York and Philadelphia which have traditionally been served by gas produced in Gulf Coast and mid-continent production areas which are connected to its pipelines. This has caused and may continue to cause gas produced in supply areas connected to its system to be diverted to other market areas which may adversely affect capacity utilization and transportation rates on its systems. In addition, as discussed above, growing supplies of natural gas from developing supply basins, especially shale plays, connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s system have caused and may continue to cause basis spreads to narrow. All of these dynamics continue to impair Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts or to sell interruptible and short term firm transportation services at attractive rates, which adversely impacts Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues and distributable cash flows.  Changes in the price of natural gas and NGLs impacts supply of and demand for those commodities, which impacts Boardwalk Pipeline’s business.  Natural gas prices in the U.S. are currently lower than historical averages driven by the abundant and growing gas supply discussed above. The prices of natural gas and NGLs fluctuates in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors, including:        —    worldwide economic conditions;        —    weather conditions, seasonal trends and hurricane disruptions;        —    the relationship between the available supplies and the demand for natural gas and NGLs;        —    new supply sources;        —    the availability of adequate transportation capacity;        —    storage inventory levels;        —    the price and availability of oil and other forms of energy;        —    the effect of energy conservation measures;        —    the nature and extent of, and changes in, governmental regulation, new regulations adopted by the EPA for example greenhouse gas legislation and taxation; and        —    the anticipated future prices of natural gas, oil and other commodities.    33    Table of Contents It is difficult to predict future changes in natural gas and NGL prices. However, the economic environment that has existed over the last several years generally indicates a bias toward continued downward pressure on natural gas prices. Sustained low natural gas prices could negatively impact producers including those directly connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines that have contracted for capacity with them.  Conversely, future increases in the price of natural gas could make alternative energy sources more competitive and reduce demand for natural gas. A reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, reduce the demand for its services and could result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire and affect its midstream businesses.  Boardwalk Pipeline may not have sufficient available cash, to continue making distributions to unitholders at the current distribution rate or at all.  The amount of cash Boardwalk Pipeline can distribute to its unitholders, including us, principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations and financing activities and the amount of cash it requires, or determines to use, for other purposes, all of which fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on a number of factors. Many of these factors are beyond the control of Boardwalk Pipeline. Some of the factors that influence the amount of cash Boardwalk Pipeline has available for distribution in any quarter include:        —    the level of capital expenditures it makes or anticipates making, including for expansion and growth projects;        —    the cost and form of payment for pending or anticipated acquisitions and growth or expansion projects and the commercial success of any such initiatives;        —    the amount of cash necessary to meet its current or anticipated debt service requirements and other liabilities;        —    fluctuations in working capital needs;        —    its ability to borrow funds and/or access capital markets to fund operations or capital expenditures, including acquisitions; restrictions contained in its debt agreements; and        —    fluctuations in cash generated by its operations, including as a result of the seasonality of its business, customer payment issues and general business conditions such as, among others, contract renewals, basis spreads, market rates, and fluctuations in PAL revenues.  Boardwalk Pipeline may determine to reduce or eliminate distributions at any time it determines that its cash reserves are insufficient or are otherwise required to fund current or anticipated future operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, growth or expansion projects or other business needs. Any such reduction would reduce the amount of cash available to us.  Investments that Boardwalk Pipeline makes, whether through acquisitions or growth projects, that appear to be accretive may nevertheless reduce its distributable cash flows.  Boardwalk Pipeline plans to continue to grow and diversify its business by among other things, investing in assets through acquisitions and organic growth projects. Its ability to grow, diversify and increase distributable cash flows will depend, in part, on its ability to close and execute on accretive acquisitions and projects. Any such transaction involves potential risks that may include, among other things:        —    the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns;        —    inaccurate assumptions about volume, revenues and costs, including potential synergies;        —    a decrease in liquidity as a result of Boardwalk Pipeline using available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition or project;    34    Table of Contents     —    a significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if Boardwalk Pipeline incurs additional debt to finance the acquisition or project;        —    inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;        —    an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets or the developed assets;        —    unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and        —    changes in regulatory requirements.  Additionally, acquisitions contain the following risks:        —    an inability to integrate successfully the businesses it acquires;        —    the assumption of unknown liabilities for which Boardwalk Pipeline is not indemnified, for which its indemnity is inadequate or for which its insurance policies may exclude from coverage;        —    limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; and        —    customer or key employee losses of an acquired business.  Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers.  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Boardwalk Pipeline’s exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas or other products owed by customers for imbalances or product loaned by it to them under certain of its services. For Boardwalk Pipeline’s FERC-regulated business, Boardwalk Pipeline’s tariffs only allow it to require limited credit support in the event that its transportation customers are unable to pay for its services. If any of its significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by them or contracted for with them, or to repay the product they owe them, it could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s business. In addition, as contracts expire, the credit or financial failure of any of its customers could also result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.  Boardwalk Pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues. The loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in its revenues.  Boardwalk Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of revenues. Its largest customer in terms of revenue, Devon Gas Services, LP, represented over 12% of its 2012 revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline’s top ten customers comprised approximately 47% of its revenues in 2012. Boardwalk Pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts with key customers on favorable terms which could materially reduce its contracted transportation volumes and the rates it can charge for its services.    35    Table of Contents Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to FERC’s rate-making policies which could limit its ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.  Boardwalk Pipeline is subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates it can charge for its natural gas transportation and storage operations. For Boardwalk Pipeline’s cost-based services, FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates it can charge. The basic elements that FERC considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to recover all of its costs, including certain costs associated with pipeline integrity, through existing or future rates.  Customers or FERC can challenge the existing rates on any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines. Such a challenge against them could adversely affect its ability to charge rates that would cover future increases in its costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return.  If any of Boardwalk Pipeline’ pipelines under FERC jurisdiction were to file a rate case, or if they have to defend their rates in a proceeding commenced by a customer or FERC, Boardwalk Pipeline would be required, among other things, to establish that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in its cost of service is just and reasonable. Under current FERC policy, since it is a limited partnership and does not pay U.S. federal income taxes, this would require it to show that its unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to federal income taxation. To support such a showing, Boardwalk Pipeline’s general partner may elect to require owners of its units to re-certify their status as being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline or may attempt to provide other evidence. Boardwalk Pipeline can provide no assurance that the evidence it might provide to FERC will be sufficient to establish that its unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to U.S. federal income tax liability on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline’s jurisdictional pipelines. If Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to make such a showing, FERC could disallow a substantial portion of the income tax allowance included in the determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by its pipelines, which could result in a reduction of such maximum rates from current levels.  Pipeline safety laws and regulations requiring the performance of integrity management programs or the use of certain safety technologies could subject Boardwalk Pipeline to increased capital and operating costs and require it to use more comprehensive and stringent safety controls.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines are subject to regulation by the DOT under the NGPSA with respect to natural gas and the HLPSA with respect to NGLs, both as amended. The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. These amendments have resulted in the adoption of rules by the DOT, through PHMSA, that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections, correction of identified anomalies and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas, such as high population areas, areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and commercially navigable waterways. These regulations have resulted in an overall increase in maintenance costs. Due to recent highly publicized incidents on certain pipelines in the U.S., it is possible that PHMSA may develop more stringent regulations. Boardwalk Pipeline could incur significant additional costs if new or more stringently interpreted pipeline safety requirements are implemented.  The 2011 Act was enacted and signed into law in early 2012. Under the 2011 Act, maximum civil penalties for certain violations have been increased to $200,000 per violation per day, and from a total cap of $1 million to $2 million. In addition, the 2011 Act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through September 30, 2015, and directs the Secretary of Transportation to undertake a number of reviews, studies and reports, some of which may result in additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking. A number of the provisions of the 2011 Act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs.    36    Table of Contents Boardwalk Pipeline needs to maintain authority from PHMSA to operate portions of its pipeline systems at higher than normal operating pressures.  Boardwalk Pipeline has entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers which utilize the design capacity of certain of its pipeline assets, assuming that Boardwalk Pipeline operates those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures (up to 0.80 of the pipeline’s SMYS). Boardwalk Pipeline has authority from PHMSA to operate those pipeline assets at such higher pressures, however PHMSA retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. If PHMSA were to withdraw or materially modify such authority, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on its pipeline assets and could incur significant additional costs to re-obtain such authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, HighMount Exploration & Production LLC  HighMount may not be able to replace reserves and sustain production at current levels. Replacing reserves is risky and uncertain and requires significant capital expenditures.  HighMount’s success depends largely upon its ability to find, develop or acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless HighMount replaces the reserves produced through successful development, exploration or acquisition, its proved reserves will decline over time. HighMount may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future or to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs. HighMount makes a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of reserves. HighMount’s net cash flows have been negatively impacted by reduced natural gas and NGL prices as well as increased drilling costs developing HighMount’s oil reserves. If HighMount’s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund its capital expenditure budget, there can be no assurance that financing will be available or available at favorable terms to meet those requirements.  Estimates of natural gas and oil reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise.  Estimating the volume of proved natural gas and oil reserves is a complex process and is not an exact science because of numerous uncertainties inherent in the process. The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.  Actual future production, commodity prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves most likely will vary from HighMount’s estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of HighMount’s reserves. In addition, HighMount may adjust estimates of proved reserves upward or downward to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing commodity prices and prevailing development expenses.  The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor, used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate representation of their value.  If commodity prices remain depressed, HighMount may be required to take additional write-downs of the carrying values of its properties.  HighMount may be required, under full cost accounting rules, to write-down the carrying value of its natural gas and oil properties. A number of factors could result in a write-down, including continued low commodity prices, a substantial downward adjustment to estimated proved reserves, a substantial increase in estimated development costs, or deterioration in exploration results. It is difficult to predict future changes in gas prices. However, the abundance of natural gas supply discoveries over the last few years would generally indicate a bias toward downward pressure on prices. HighMount utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities. Under full cost accounting, HighMount is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or “ceiling,” of the book value of    37    Table of Contents  HighMount’s natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value (discounted at the required rate of 10%) of the future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges, calculated using the average first day of the month price for the preceding 12-month period.  If the net book value of HighMount’s exploration and production (“E&P”) properties (reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability) exceeds its ceiling limitation, HighMount will impair or “write-down” the book value of its E&P properties. HighMount recorded a ceiling test impairment charge in each quarter of 2012, totaling $433 million (after taxes) for the year ended December 31, 2012 as a result of declines in natural gas and NGL prices. A write-down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Depending on the magnitude of any future impairment, a ceiling test write-down could significantly reduce HighMount’s income, or produce a loss.  Natural gas, oil and other commodity prices are volatile.  The commodity price HighMount receives for its production heavily influences its revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. If the current low price environment for natural gas continues, HighMount’s results of operations will be lower as well. HighMount is subject to risks due to frequent and possibly substantial fluctuations in commodity prices. NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and HighMount expects this volatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas and oil depend upon factors beyond HighMount’s control. These factors include, among others, economic and market conditions, domestic production and import levels, storage levels, basis differentials, weather, government regulations and taxation. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that HighMount can produce economically.  HighMount engages in commodity price hedging activities.  The extent of HighMount’s commodity price risk is related to the effectiveness and scope of HighMount’s hedging activities. To the extent HighMount hedges its commodity price risk, HighMount will forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in its favor. Furthermore, because HighMount has entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of its natural gas and oil production, HighMount will continue to have direct commodity price risk on the unhedged portion. HighMount’s actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than HighMount estimates at the time it enters into derivative transactions for that period.  As a result, HighMount’s hedging activities may not be as effective as HighMount intends in reducing the volatility of its cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of cash flows. In addition, even though HighMount’s management monitors its hedging activities, these activities can result in substantial losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement or if the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally  In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, terrorism, hurricanes and other natural disasters, competition, government regulation, dependence on key executives and employees, litigation, dependence on information technology and compliance with environmental laws.  Acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.  Future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad, as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on the assets and businesses of certain of our subsidiaries. CNA issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act. Terrorist acts or the threat of terrorism, including increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in the price of oil and gas, could affect the market for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services, Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation, gathering and storage services and HighMount’s exploration and production    38    Table of Contents  activities. In addition, future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to secure their assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.  Our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations.  The businesses operated by our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal, state and local governmental regulations which impose or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies. Governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies. Risks faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following:  CNA. The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders rather than its investors. Each jurisdiction in which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate its business. In addition, the Lloyd’s marketplace sets rules under which its members, including CNA’s Hardy syndicate operate. These rules and regulations include the following:        —    standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;        —    restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;        —    restrictions on CNA’s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas;        —    the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;        —    the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;        —    potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;        —    licensing of insurers and agents;        —    approval of policy forms;        —    limitations on the ability of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and        —    limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.  Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. CNA may also be required by the jurisdictions in which it does business to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible. Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and is generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.  Diamond Offshore. The offshore drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant capital expenditures for additional equipment to comply with governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or result in a reduction in revenues associated with downtime required to install such equipment, or may otherwise significantly limit drilling activity.    39    Table of Contents In the aftermath of the Macondo well blowout in April of 2010 and the subsequent investigation into the causes of the event, new rules have been implemented for oil and gas operations in the GOM and in many of the international locations in which Diamond Offshore operates, including new standards for well design, casing and cementing and well control procedures, as well as rules requiring operators to systematically identify risks and establish safeguards against those risks through a comprehensive safety and environmental management system (“SEMS”). New regulations may continue to be announced, including rules regarding drilling systems and equipment, such as blowout preventer and well control systems and lifesaving systems as well as rules regarding employee training, engaging personnel in safety management and requiring third party audits of SEMS programs. Such new regulations could require modifications or enhancements to existing systems and equipment, or require new equipment, and could increase Diamond Offshore’s operating costs and cause downtime for its rigs if it is required to take any of them out of service between scheduled surveys or inspections, or if it is required to extend scheduled surveys or inspections, to meet any such new requirements. Diamond Offshore is not able to predict the likelihood, nature or extent of additional rulemaking, nor is it able to predict the future impact of these events on operations. Additional governmental regulations concerning licensing, taxation, equipment specifications, training requirements or other matters could increase the costs of Diamond Offshore’s operations, and enhanced permitting requirements as well as escalating costs borne by its customers could reduce exploration activity in the GOM and therefore demand for its services.  Governments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s operations by limiting drilling opportunities.  Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by FERC and the DOT among other federal and state authorities. In addition to FERC rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its services, federal regulations extend to pipeline safety, operating terms and conditions of service, the types of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer, construction or abandonment of facilities, accounting and record keeping, and relationships and transactions with affiliated companies. These regulations can adversely impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, including by increasing the lead times to develop projects, offer new services, or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines.  HighMount. All of HighMount’s operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among other things: permits to drill and to conduct other operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area); the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties; maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells; venting or flaring of natural gas; and the ratability of production and the operation of gathering systems and related assets. Changes in these regulations, which HighMount cannot predict, could be harmful to HighMount’s business and results of operations.  Hydraulic fracturing is a technique commonly used by oil and gas exploration companies, including HighMount, to stimulate the production of oil and natural gas by injecting fluids and sand into underground wells at high pressures, causing fractures or fissures in the geological formation which allow oil and gas to flow more freely. In recent years, concerns have been raised that the fracturing process and disposal of drilling fluids may contaminate underground sources of drinking water. The conference committee report for The Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requested the EPA to conduct a study of hydraulic fracturing, particularly the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. In December of 2012 the EPA issued a progress report of the projects the EPA is conducting as part of the study. A final draft report is expected to be released for public comment and peer review in 2014. Several bills were introduced in the 111th and 112th Congresses seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, which has historically been regulated at the state level, though none of the proposed legislation was passed into law. Similar bills may be introduced in the    40    Table of Contents  current Congress and a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. If hydraulic fracturing is banned or significantly restricted by federal regulation or otherwise, it could impair HighMount’s ability to economically drill new wells, which would reduce its production, revenues and profitability.  HighMount owns and operates gas gathering lines and related facilities which are regulated by the DOT and state agencies with respect to safety and operating conditions. PHMSA has established minimum federal safety standards for certain gas gathering lines. PHMSA has indicated that changes to the current regulatory framework are needed to address gas exploration and production activities. If implemented, the new changes could impact HighMount’s ability to transport some of its natural gas or cause HighMount to incur additional costs.  Our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.  Our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, many of which have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose strict liability, which could be substantial, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. For example, Diamond Offshore could be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to its operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by others. HighMount is subject to extensive environmental regulation in the conduct of its business, particularly related to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. Boardwalk Pipeline is also subject to laws and regulations, including requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which it disposes of waste, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination and requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements.  We are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.  As awareness of climate change issues increases, governments around the world are beginning to address the matter. This may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our subsidiaries and their suppliers and customers. We and our subsidiaries may be exposed to risks related to new laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas, thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel and related services provided by our energy subsidiaries. Governments also may pass laws or regulations encouraging or mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, changing global weather patterns have been associated with extreme weather events and could change longer-term natural catastrophe trends, including increasing the frequency and severity of hurricanes and other natural disasters which could increase future catastrophe losses at CNA and damage to property, disruption of business and higher operating costs at Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk Pipeline, HighMount and Loews Hotels.  There is currently no federal regulation that limits GHG emissions in the U.S. However, several bills were introduced in Congress in recent years that would regulate U.S. GHG emissions under a cap and trade system. Although these bills were not passed into law, some regulation of that type may be enacted in the U.S. in the near future. In addition, in 2009 the EPA adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual GHG emissions by operators of facilities that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of GHG per year, which includes Boardwalk Pipeline and HighMount. Numerous states and several regional multi-state climate initiatives have announced or adopted plans to regulate GHG emissions, though the state programs vary widely. The establishment of a GHG reporting system and registry may be a first step toward broader regulation of GHG emissions. Compliance with future laws and regulations could impose significant costs on affected companies or adversely affect the demand for and the cost to produce and transport hydrocarbon-based fuel, which would adversely affect the businesses of our energy subsidiaries.    41    Table of Contents Any significant interruption in the operation of critical computer systems could materially disrupt operations.  We and our subsidiaries have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our businesses. We are dependent upon operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our businesses. Any failure of our or our subsidiaries’ computer systems, or those of our or their customers, vendors or others with whom we and they do business, could materially disrupt business operations. Computer and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable or impaired from a variety of causes, including among others, storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. In addition, it has been reported that unknown entities or groups have mounted so-called “cyber attacks” on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal data. Any cyber attacks that affect our or our subsidiaries’ facilities could have a material adverse effect on our and their business or reputation.  Loss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect personal information could result in a materially adverse effect on our operations.  We and our subsidiaries rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the United States and abroad. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware, software and services, as well as other critical materials and services. If one or more key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, or fails to protect our proprietary information, including in some cases personal information of employees, customers or hotel guests, we and our subsidiaries may experience a material adverse effect on our or their business or reputation.  We could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long-lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries.  Our subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Most notably, we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of offshore drilling equipment at Diamond Offshore, natural gas and oil properties at HighMount, pipeline equipment at Boardwalk Pipeline and hotel properties owned by Loews Hotels.  We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting units and estimate each unit’s fair value as of the testing date. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units (each of our principal operating subsidiaries) based on estimates of future discounted cash flows, which reflect management’s judgments and assumptions regarding the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, future industry conditions and operations and other factors. Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.  We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.  We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies, and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders.    42    Table of Contents We could have liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.  As a result of our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”) prior to the separation of Lorillard from us in 2008 (the “Separation”), from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the Separation. In the Separation Agreement entered into between us and Lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business, including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. An adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and equity. We do not expect that the Separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity with respect to tobacco-related claims. We do not believe that we have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims.  Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
