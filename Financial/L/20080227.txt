Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.  Our business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries.  Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, financial condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries. In addition, the risks and uncertainties described below relating to our Carolina Group stock and our Lorillard subsidiary could lead to a material loss in the value of the Carolina Group stock.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, are public companies and file reports with the SEC. You are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities.  We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries.  We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders.  Our recent acquisition of HighMount creates risks and uncertainties.  On July 31, 2007, HighMount acquired certain exploration and production assets, and assumed certain related obligations, from subsidiaries of Dominion for approximately $4.0 billion. As with any acquisition, our acquisition of HighMount involves potential risks, including, among other things:          ·   variations from assumptions about the amount of recoverable reserves, production volumes, revenues and costs and the future price of natural gas and NGLs;              ·   an inability to successfully integrate the business;              ·   difficulty in hiring, training or retaining qualified personnel to manage and operate the business;              ·   an inability to coordinate organizations, systems and facilities needed to operate HighMount as a stand-alone business, independent from Dominion, including reliance on transition services to be provided by Dominion;              ·   the assumption of unknown liabilities and limitations on our rights to indemnity from Dominion;              ·   the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns; and              ·   unforeseen difficulties operating in a new industry.      In connection with the acquisition, we conducted a customary due diligence review of the acquired business, including among other things, assessment of recoverable reserves, title to acquired assets, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments, we performed a review of HighMount’s properties, but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due diligence, we did not inspect every well, facility or pipeline. We could not       28          Item 1A. Risk Factors    necessarily observe structural and environmental problems or reserves. We were not able to obtain contractual indemnities from Dominion for many pre-closing liabilities and risks, known or unknown, and assumed many such risks. The incurrence of an unexpected liability or the failure of the business to perform in accordance with our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  Risks Related to the Separation  We will face different risks after the Separation.  If the Separation is consummated, we will have a different operational and financial profile than before the Separation. We will no longer own any of the outstanding stock of Lorillard, our balance sheet will no longer reflect the assets and liabilities of Lorillard and our income statement and statement of cash flows will no longer reflect Lorillard’s operations. We expect that our total market capitalization will decrease following the Separation. In addition, because we will no longer be entitled to receipt of dividends from Lorillard, our ability to pay dividends and to finance capital expenditures, working capital and acquisitions may be adversely affected.  We could have liability for tobacco-related lawsuits after the Separation.  As a result of our ownership of Lorillard, from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits. We are currently a defendant in four such lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, even after the consummation of the Separation. In the Separation Agreement which is to be entered into between us and Lorillard at or prior to the time of the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries will agree to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business, including liabilities that we may incur for tobacco-related litigation against us. An adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and equity.  Risks Related to an Investment in Our Carolina Group Stock  We cannot be certain that we will continue to pay dividends on our Carolina Group stock.  Determinations as to the future dividends on Carolina Group stock primarily will depend on the dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries, our capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant. The amount of dividends that legally could be paid on Carolina Group stock if the Carolina Group were a separate Delaware corporation may be greater than the amount actually available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law and our charter. Furthermore, our ability to pay dividends on Carolina Group stock may be reduced by dividends that we pay on our common stock.  Our board of directors reserves the right to declare and pay dividends on Carolina Group stock, and could, in its sole discretion, declare and pay dividends, or refrain from declaring and paying dividends, on Carolina Group stock. Our board of directors may take such actions regardless of the amounts available for the payment of dividends on Carolina Group stock, the amount of prior dividends declared on Carolina Group stock, the voting or liquidation rights of Carolina Group stock, or any other factor.  The independence of the board of directors of Lorillard, Inc. and the board of directors of its wholly owned subsidiary, Lorillard Tobacco Company, may affect Lorillard’s payment of dividends to us and thereby inhibit our ability or willingness to pay dividends and make other distributions on our Carolina Group stock.  Our ability and willingness to pay dividends and make other distributions on Carolina Group stock, including dividends and distributions following a disposition of substantially all of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, will depend on a number of factors, including whether the independent board of directors of Lorillard Tobacco Company causes Lorillard Tobacco Company to declare and pay dividends to its parent, Lorillard, Inc. and whether, in turn, the independent board of directors of Lorillard, Inc. causes Lorillard, Inc. to declare and pay dividends to us. In the event that Lorillard Tobacco Company or Lorillard, Inc. does not distribute its earnings, we are unlikely to pay dividends on Carolina Group stock. To the extent Lorillard, Inc. does not distribute net proceeds following the sale of substantially all       29          Item 1A. Risk Factors    of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, we will not be required to apply the net proceeds to pay dividends to holders of Carolina Group stock or redeem shares of Carolina Group stock.  We expect that the boards of directors of each of Lorillard, Inc. and Lorillard Tobacco Company will continue to function independently of us and will direct the operations and management of the assets and businesses of those corporations, respectively. None of the individuals currently serving as directors of Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard Tobacco Company are officers, directors or employees of Loews Corporation.  We have allocated to the Carolina Group any liabilities or expenses that we incur as a result of tobacco-related litigation.  The Carolina Group has been allocated any and all liabilities, costs and expenses of us and Lorillard, Inc. and the subsidiaries and predecessors of Lorillard, Inc., arising out of or related to tobacco or otherwise arising out of the past, present or future business of Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors, or claims arising out of or related to the sale of any businesses previously sold by Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors, in each case, whether grounded in tort, contract, statute or otherwise, whether pending or asserted in the future.  Accordingly, we and/or Lorillard may make decisions with respect to litigation and settlement strategies designed to obtain our dismissal or release from tobacco-related litigation or liabilities. Such decisions and strategies could result, for example, in limitations on payment of dividends by Lorillard to us or an increase in Lorillard’s exposure in such litigation.  Holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock are shareholders of one company and, therefore, financial impacts on one group could affect the other group.  Holders of our common stock and holders of Carolina Group stock are all common shareholders of Loews Corporation and are subject to risks associated with an investment in a single company. Financial effects arising from one group that affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition could, if significant, affect the market price of the class of common shares relating to the other group. In addition, if we or any of our subsidiaries were to incur significant indebtedness on behalf of one group, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with an acquisition or investment, it could affect the credit rating of us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole. This, in turn, could increase our borrowing costs. Net losses of either group and dividends or distributions on shares of any class of common or preferred stock will reduce the funds legally available for payment of future dividends on Carolina Group stock.  The complex nature of the terms of our Carolina Group stock, or confusion in the marketplace about what a tracking stock is, could materially adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock.  Tracking stocks like Carolina Group stock are more complex than traditional common stock and are not directly or entirely comparable to common stock of stand-alone companies or companies that have been spun off by their parent companies. The complex nature of the terms of Carolina Group stock, and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding these terms, may materially adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock. Examples of these terms include:          ·   the discretion of our board of directors to make determinations that may affect Carolina Group stock and our common stock differently;              ·   our redemption and/or exchange rights under particular circumstances; and              ·   the disparate voting rights of Carolina Group stock and our common stock.      Confusion in the marketplace about what a tracking stock is and what it is intended to represent, and/or investors’ reluctance to invest in tracking stocks, could materially adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock.       30          Item 1A. Risk Factors    Holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock generally vote together as a single class.  Holders of Carolina Group stock generally do not have the right to vote separately as a class. Holders of Carolina Group stock have the right to vote as a separate class only to the extent required by Delaware law. We have not held, and do not plan to hold, separate meetings for holders of Carolina Group stock.  Holders of our common stock have significantly greater voting power than holders of our Carolina Group stock with respect to any matter as to which all of our common shares vote together as one class.  Each share of our common stock has one vote. Each share of Carolina Group stock is entitled to 3/10 of a vote, which is disproportionately less than the economic interest represented by each share of Carolina Group stock. When a vote is taken on any matter as to which all of our common shares are voting together as one class, holders of our common stock will have significantly greater voting power than holders of Carolina Group stock. As of February 15, 2008, holders of our common stock controlled approximately 94.2% of our combined voting power and holders of Carolina Group stock controlled approximately 5.8% of our combined voting power. The voting power of Carolina Group stock is subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and combinations with respect to either class of stock.  Holders of our Carolina Group stock may have interests different from holders of our common stock.  The existence of separate classes of our common stock could give rise to occasions when the interests of the holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock diverge or conflict or appear to diverge or conflict. Subject to its fiduciary duties, our board of directors could, in its sole discretion, from time to time, make determinations or implement policies that disproportionately affect the groups or the different classes of stock. Our board of directors is not required to select the option that would result in the highest value for the holders of Carolina Group stock. Examples include determinations by our board of directors to:          ·   pay or omit the payment of dividends on our common stock or Carolina Group stock;              ·   redeem shares of Carolina Group stock;              ·   approve dispositions of our assets attributed to either group;              ·   reallocate funds or assets between groups and determine the amount and type of consideration paid therefore;              ·   allocate business opportunities, resources and personnel;              ·   allocate the proceeds of issuances of Carolina Group stock either to the Loews Group, with a corresponding reduction in the intergroup interest, if and to the extent there is an intergroup interest, or to the combined attributed net assets of the Carolina Group;              ·   formulate public policy positions for us;              ·   establish relationships between the groups;              ·   make financial decisions with respect to one group that could be considered to be detrimental to the other group; and              ·   settle or otherwise seek to resolve actual or potential litigation against us in ways that might adversely affect Lorillard.      Any such decisions by our board of directors could have or be perceived to have a negative effect on the Carolina Group and could have a negative effect on the market price of Carolina Group stock.       31          Item 1A. Risk Factors    If our Carolina Group stock is not treated as a class of our common stock, several adverse federal income tax consequences will result.  It is possible that the issuance of Carolina Group stock could be characterized as property other than our stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such characterization could require us to recognize taxable gain with respect to the issuance of Carolina Group stock and the Carolina Group would be responsible for any tax liability attributable thereto. In addition, we would likely no longer be able to file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with the Carolina Group. These tax liabilities, if they arise, would likely have a material adverse effect on us and the Carolina Group.  Changes in the tax law or in the interpretation of current tax law may result in redemption of the Carolina Group stock or cessation of the issuance of shares of Carolina Group stock.  If there are adverse tax consequences to us or the Carolina Group resulting from the issuance of Carolina Group stock, it is possible that we would not issue shares of Carolina Group stock even if we would otherwise choose to do so. This possibility could affect the value of Carolina Group stock then outstanding. Furthermore, we are entitled to redeem Carolina Group stock for either (1) cash in an amount equal to 105% of the average market price per share of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common stock having a value equal to 100% of the ratio of the average market price per share of Carolina Group stock to the average market price per share of our common stock, if, based upon the opinion of tax counsel, there are adverse federal income tax law developments related to Carolina Group stock. In each case, the average market price would be determined over a specified 20 trading day period.  Our board of directors may, at any time until the 90th day after the disposition of 80% of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, redeem shares of our Carolina Group stock.  Our board of directors may, at any time until the 90th day after the disposition of 80% of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, redeem all outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for either (1) cash in an amount equal to 120% of the average market price per share of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common stock having a value equal to 115% of the ratio of the average market price per share of Carolina Group stock to the average market price per share of our common stock. In each case, the average market price would be determined over a specific 20 trading day period. A decision to redeem the Carolina Group stock could be made at a time when either or both of our common stock and Carolina Group stock may be considered to be overvalued or undervalued. In addition, a redemption would preclude holders of Carolina Group stock from retaining their investment in a security intended to reflect separately the economic performance of the Carolina Group. It would also give holders of shares of converted Carolina Group stock an amount of consideration that may be less than the amount of consideration a third party buyer pays or would pay for all or substantially all of the net assets attributed to the Carolina Group.  If we choose to redeem our Carolina Group stock for cash, holders of Carolina Group stock may have taxable gain or taxable income.  We may, under certain circumstances, redeem Carolina Group stock for cash. If we choose to do so, holders of Carolina Group stock would generally be subject to tax on the excess, if any, of the total consideration they receive for their Carolina Group stock over their adjusted basis in their Carolina Group stock.  Our board of directors does not owe a separate duty to holders of Carolina Group stock.  Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of two classes of capital stock or two groups of holders of the same class of capital stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all shareholders regardless of class or series, and does not have separate or additional duties to either group of shareholders. Thus, holders of Carolina Group stock who believe that a determination by our board of directors has a disparate impact on their class of stock may not be able to obtain a remedy for such a claim.  Our board of directors may change the Carolina Group policy statement without shareholder approval.  In connection with the initial issuance of Carolina Group stock, our board of directors adopted the Carolina Group policy statement to govern the relationship between the Loews Group and the Carolina Group. Our board of directors may modify, suspend or rescind the policies set forth in the Carolina Group policy statement or make additions or       32          Item 1A. Risk Factors    exceptions to them, in the sole discretion of our board of directors, without approval of our shareholders. Our board of directors may also adopt additional policies, depending upon the circumstances. Any changes to our policies could have a negative effect on the holders of Carolina Group stock.  Our directors’ and officers’ disproportionate ownership of our common stock compared to our Carolina Group stock may give rise to conflicts of interest.  Our directors and officers own shares of our common stock and have been awarded stock options with respect to shares of our common stock. As of February 15, 2008 our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 30.5 million shares of our common stock and no shares of Carolina Group stock, which represents approximately 5.4% of our combined voting power. Accordingly, our directors and officers could have an economic incentive to favor the Loews Group over the Carolina Group.  Because it is possible for an acquiror to obtain control of us by purchasing shares of our common stock without purchasing any shares of our Carolina Group stock, holders of Carolina Group stock may not share in any takeover premium.  Because holders of our common stock have significantly greater voting power than holders of Carolina Group stock, a potential acquiror could acquire control of us by acquiring shares of our common stock without purchasing any shares of Carolina Group stock. As a result, holders of Carolina Group stock might not share in any takeover premium and Carolina Group stock may have a lower market price than it would have if there were a greater likelihood that holders of Carolina Group stock would share in any takeover premium.  Holders of our Carolina Group stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group than if the Carolina Group were a separate company.  Assuming the assets attributed to the Carolina Group represent less than substantially all of our assets as a whole, our board of directors could, in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval, approve sales and other dispositions of any amount of our assets attributed to the Carolina Group because the Delaware General Corporation Law requires shareholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the entire company. Similarly, the boards of directors of Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries could decide to sell or otherwise dispose of the operating and other assets reflected in the financial statements of the Carolina Group without the approval of holders of Carolina Group stock.  If 80% or more of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group are sold, we may take one of the following actions, and if we receive any net proceeds from the sale and determine not to retain all of such proceeds as tobacco contingency reserves, we must take one of the following actions:          ·   pay a special dividend to holders of Carolina Group stock in an amount equal to their pro rata share of the net proceeds (subject to reduction for repayment of notional intergroup debt, amounts not distributed from Lorillard to us and the creation by us of reserves for tobacco-related contingent liabilities and future costs) from the disposition in the form of cash and/or securities (other than our common stock);              ·   redeem shares of Carolina Group stock for cash and/or securities (other than our common stock) in an amount equal to the pro rata share of the net proceeds (subject to reduction for repayment of notional intergroup debt) from the disposition of all of the assets attributable to the Carolina Group;              ·   redeem shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of our common stock at a 15% premium based on the respective market values of Carolina Group stock and our common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the 5th trading day prior to announcement of the sale; or              ·   take some combination of the actions described above.      Our board of directors has the discretion to choose from the foregoing options. The value of the consideration paid to holders of Carolina Group stock in the different scenarios described above could be significantly different. Our board of       33          Item 1A. Risk Factors    directors would not be required to select the option that would result in the distribution with the highest value to the holders of Carolina Group stock.  If, on the 91st day following the sale of 80% or more of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, we have not redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock and Lorillard subsequently distributes to us any previously undistributed portion of the net proceeds and/or we subsequently release any amount of net proceeds previously retained by us as a reserve for tobacco-related contingent liabilities or future costs, we will distribute the pro rata share of such amounts to holders of Carolina Group stock. At any time after:          ·   Lorillard has distributed to us all previously undistributed portions of the net proceeds;              ·   no amounts remain in reserve in respect of tobacco-related contingent liabilities and future costs; and              ·   the only asset remaining in the Carolina Group is cash and/or cash equivalents,      then we may redeem all of the outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for cash in an amount equal to the greater of (1) the pro rata share of the remaining assets of the Carolina Group and (2) $0.001 per share of Carolina Group stock.  If the Carolina Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, some of the costs of that sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, shareholders of a separate, independent company might receive an amount greater than the net proceeds that would be received by the holders of Carolina Group stock. In addition, we cannot assure that the net proceeds per share of Carolina Group stock received by its holder in connection with any redemption following a sale of Carolina Group assets will be equal to or greater than the market value per share of Carolina Group stock prior to or after announcement of a sale of assets reflected in the Carolina Group. Nor can we assure that, where consideration is based on the market value of Carolina Group stock, the market value will be equal to or greater than the net proceeds per share of Carolina Group stock.  We may cause a mandatory exchange of our Carolina Group stock.  We may exchange all outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of one or more of our qualifying subsidiaries. Such an exchange would result in the qualifying subsidiary or subsidiaries becoming a separate public company and the holders of Carolina Group stock owning shares directly in that subsidiary or those subsidiaries. If we choose to exchange shares of Carolina Group stock in this manner, the market value of the common stock received in that exchange could be less than the market value of Carolina Group stock exchanged.  If we are liquidated, amounts distributed to holders of our Carolina Group stock may not reflect the value of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group.  In the event we are liquidated, we would determine the liquidation rights of the holders of Carolina Group stock in accordance with the market capitalization of the outstanding shares of the Loews Group and the Carolina Group at a specified time prior to the time of liquidation. However, the relative market capitalization of the outstanding shares of each group may not correctly reflect the value of the net assets remaining and attributed to the groups after satisfaction of outstanding liabilities. Accordingly, the holders of Carolina Group stock could receive less consideration upon liquidation than they would if the groups were separate entities.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation  If CNA determines that loss reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims, CNA may need to increase its loss reserves.  CNA maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reserves represent CNA management’s best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by CNA, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of       34          Item 1A. Risk Factors    claims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling and case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant management judgment. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, CNA is sometimes required to add to its reserves. This is called unfavorable development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial and can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity. Please read additional information on CNA’s reserves included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA is subject to uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves which can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:          ·   increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical products;              ·   the effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other major corporate governance failures, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims, including director and officer and errors and omissions insurance claims;              ·   class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices;              ·   construction defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional insured endorsements on policies;              ·   clergy abuse claims, including passage of legislation to reopen or extend various statutes of limitations; and              ·   mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to silica, welding rods, benzene, lead and various other chemical exposure claims.      In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. In addition, CNA periodically undergoes state regulatory financial examinations, including review and analysis of its reserves. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against CNA’s earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient.  Loss reserves for asbestos and environmental pollution are especially difficult to estimate and may result in more frequent and larger additions to these reserves.  CNA’s experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&E claim and claim adjustment expenses are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported claims are subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of additional factors, including among others:          ·   coverage issues, including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits apply;              ·   inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories;              ·   continuing aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’ lawyers;              ·   the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;              ·   changes in the volume of asbestos and environmental pollution claims;           35          Item 1A. Risk Factors            ·   the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on any umbrella or excess policies CNA has issued;              ·   the number and outcome of direct actions against CNA;              ·   CNA’s ability to recover reinsurance for these claims; and              ·   changes in the legal and legislative environment in which CNA operates.      As a result of this higher degree of variability, CNA has necessarily supplemented traditional actuarial methods and techniques with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many of which involve significant judgment on the part of management. Consequently, CNA may periodically need to record changes in its claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future in these areas in amounts that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings. The sections below provide more details involving the specific factors affecting CNA’s estimation of reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&E. Additional information on A&E claims is included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  Environmental pollution claims. The estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claims is complicated by the assertion by many policyholders of claims for defense costs and indemnification. CNA and others in the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims. Key coverage issues in these claims include:          ·   whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and accordingly whether CNA would be liable for these costs);              ·   the trigger of coverage, and the allocation of liability among triggered policies;              ·   the applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions;              ·   the potential for joint and several liability; and              ·   the definition of an occurrence.      To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding to the uncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.  Further, the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability and insurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensive litigation. In many cases, courts have expanded the scope of coverage and liability for cleanup costs beyond the original intent of CNA’s insurance policies. In addition, the standards for cleanup in environmental pollution matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject to cleanup under applicable laws is unknown and the impact of various proposals to reform existing statutes and regulations is difficult to predict.  Asbestos claims. The estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult for many of the same reasons discussed above for environmental pollution claims, as well as:          ·   inconsistency of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court decisions;              ·   specific policy provisions;              ·   allocation of liability among insurers and insureds;              ·   missing policies and proof of coverage;              ·   the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties;           36          Item 1A. Risk Factors            ·   novel theories asserted by policyholders and their legal counsel;              ·   the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants;              ·   uncertainties in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds may be targeted in the future;              ·   volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands;              ·   increases in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims;              ·   the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to aggregate limits;              ·   the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation, as well as the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims;              ·   medical inflation trends;              ·   the mix of asbestos-related diseases presented; and              ·   the ability to recover reinsurance.      In addition, a number of CNA’s insureds have asserted that their claims against CNA for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. If these insureds are successful in this regard, CNA’s potential liability for their claims would be unlimited. Some of these insureds contend that their asbestos claims fall within the so-called “non-products” liability coverage within their policies, rather than the products liability coverage, and that this “non-products” liability coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the extent to which these claims will succeed and, as a result, the ultimate size of these claims.  Catastrophe losses are unpredictable.  Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, severe winter weather, and fires, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, and snow. For example, in 2005, CNA experienced substantial losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves. In addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to CNA to be finally determined. As its claim experience develops on a particular catastrophe, CNA may be required to adjust reserves, or take unfavorable development, to reflect its revised estimates of the total cost of claims. CNA believes that it could incur significant catastrophe losses in the future. Please read information on catastrophe losses included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA’s key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings could vary significantly from actual experience.  CNA’s reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remaining in force, interest rates, and future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the deferred acquisition asset may not be fully realized and the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development.       37          Item 1A. Risk Factors    High levels of retained overhead expenses associated with business lines in run-off negatively impact CNA’s operating results.  During the past several years, CNA ceased offering certain insurance products relating principally to its life, group and reinsurance segments. Many of these business lines were sold, others have been placed in run-off and, as a result, revenue has decreased. CNA’s results of operations have been materially, adversely affected by the high levels of retained overhead expenses associated with these run-off operations, and will continue to be so affected if CNA is not successful in eliminating or reducing these costs.  CNA’s premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.  CNA purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of CNA’s business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost CNA deems acceptable, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of CNA’s underwriting commitments. Please read information on reinsurance included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers.  CNA has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in the balance sheets and estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to it. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due to it from reinsurers, its claims expenses will be higher. Please read information on reinsurance included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings for CNA in the future, and thereby adversely affect CNA’s ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.  Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as its public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company, Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s. Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debtholders.  Due to the intense competitive environment in which CNA operates, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for CNA to take material unfavorable development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to further lower CNA’s ratings in the future. If CNA’s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings were downgraded below current levels, its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.  In addition, CNA believes that a lowering of our debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s circumstances. CNA has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more than one level below CNA’s current ratings. Please read information on our ratings included in the MD&A under Item 7.       38          Item 1A. Risk Factors    CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it does not meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.   Insurance companies such as CNA are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of CNA’s statutory capital and surplus reported in CNA’s statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the risk-based capital formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, state regulators may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business. If CNA is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital. Examples of events leading CNA to record a material charge against earnings include impairment of its investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience.  CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.  CNA Financial Corporation is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Dividend payments, however, must be approved by the subsidiaries’ domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment. Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year’s earned surplus. If CNA is restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, CNA may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital, which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.  CNA received subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to insurance brokers and agents, contingent commissions and bidding practices, and certain finite-risk insurance products.  Along with other companies in the industry, CNA has received subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries from and have produced documents and/or provided information to: (i) California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators concerning investigations into practices including contingent compensation arrangements, fictitious quotes, and tying arrangements; (ii) the SEC, the New York State Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the Connecticut Attorney General, the Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Delaware Department of Insurance, the Georgia Office of Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner and the California Department of Insurance concerning reinsurance products and finite insurance products purchased and sold by CNA; (iii) the Massachusetts Attorney General and the Connecticut Attorney General concerning investigations into anti-competitive practices; and (iv) the New York State Attorney General concerning declinations of attorney malpractice insurance.  The SEC and representatives of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York conducted interviews with several of CNA’s current and former executives relating to the restatement of its financial results for 2004, including CNA’s relationship with and accounting for transactions with an affiliate that were the basis for the restatement. CNA has also provided the SEC with information relating to our restatement in 2006 of prior period results. It is possible that CNA’s analyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance contracts or discontinued operations could be questioned or disputed by regulatory authorities.  CNA’s investment portfolio, which is a key component of its overall profitability, may suffer reduced returns or losses, in the event of changing interest rates or adverse credit conditions in the capital markets.  Investment returns are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability. General economic conditions, changes in financial markets such as fluctuations in interest rates, long term periods of low interest rates, credit conditions and currency, commodity and stock prices, including the short and long term effects of losses produced or threatened in relation to sub-prime residential mortgage backed securities, and many other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the returns and the overall value of its investments and the realization of investment income. In addition,       39          Item 1A. Risk Factors    any defaults in the payments due to CNA for its investments, especially with respect to fixed maturity securities, could reduce CNA’s investment income and could cause CNA to incur investment losses. Further, CNA invests a portion of its assets in equity securities and limited partnerships, which may be subject to greater volatility than its fixed income investments. In some cases, these limited partnerships use leverage and are thereby subject to even greater volatility. Although limited partnership investments generally provide higher expected return, they present greater risk and are more illiquid than CNA’s fixed income investments. As a result of all of these factors, CNA may not realize an adequate return on its investments, may incur losses on sales of its investments, and may be required to write down the value of its investments.  CNA has incurred and may incur further investment losses and may incur underwriting losses, relating to the sub-prime crisis and the related credit crisis.  CNA faces sub-prime valuation and credit exposure risks within its investment portfolio through its holdings in corporate asset-backed structured securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) which are typically collateralized with residential mortgages. During the course of 2007, the market value of some of these securities decreased as a result of the increase in delinquency rates on the underlying mortgages and a decrease in the value of the homes held as collateral for the investment. This deterioration of the collateral underlying the securities caused downgrades by rating agencies, decreased liquidity, and led to some securities going into default and has led to a material adverse impact on financial markets generally. The potential for higher delinquency and default rates may continue to adversely impact CNA’s sub-prime market valuations. In addition, the process of validating fair values provided by third parties for securities that are not regularly traded requires significant judgment on CNA’s part. Accordingly, CNA may conclude that other-than-temporary write downs of these securities are required or may experience unanticipated losses in other sectors of its overall investment portfolio.  CNA provides management and professional liability insurance and surety bonds to businesses engaged in finance, professional services and real estate. Many of these businesses have exposure directly or indirectly relating to the sub-prime crisis and the related credit crisis. As a result, CNA may experience unanticipated underwriting losses with respect to these lines of business.  CNA may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.  The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Lorillard, Inc.  Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 3,775 tobacco-related lawsuits, which are extremely costly to defend, and which could result in substantial judgments against Lorillard.  Numerous legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes are pending against Lorillard, and it is likely that similar claims will continue to be filed for the foreseeable future. In addition, several cases have been filed against Lorillard and other tobacco companies challenging certain provisions of the MSA and state statutes promulgated to carry out and enforce the MSA.  Approximately 3,775 tobacco-related cases are pending against Lorillard in the United States. Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars, are specifically pleaded in a number of cases in addition to compensatory and other damages. It is possible that the outcome of these cases, individually or in the aggregate, could result in bankruptcy. It is also possible that Lorillard may be unable to post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution of a judgment in jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on the merits of the case. Even if Lorillard is successful in defending some or all of these actions, these types of cases are very expensive to defend. A material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs.  Further, adverse decisions in actions against tobacco companies other than Lorillard could have an adverse impact on the industry, including Lorillard. In several cases in recent years, for example, various courts, including the U.S.       40          Item 1A. Risk Factors    Supreme Court, have considered the ratio of awards of actual damages to those of punitive damages. In 2006, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the verdict in Williams v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., in which plaintiff was awarded approximately $525,000 in compensatory damages and $80 million in punitive damages, a ratio of more than 150:1. In February of 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated that decision on other grounds and returned Williams to the Oregon Supreme Court for further consideration. During January of 2008, the Oregon Supreme Court reaffirmed its 2006 ruling that upheld the jury’s damages awards. Lorillard is not a party to Williams. Should appellate courts establish binding precedents regarding these or other issues, the conduct of future trials including Lorillard would be affected. Please read information included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.  A judgment has been rendered against Lorillard in the Scott litigation.  In June of 2004, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in Scott v. The American Tobacco Company, et al. (District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24, 1996), a class action on behalf of certain cigarette smokers resident in the State of Louisiana. The jury awarded plaintiffs approximately $591 million to fund cessation programs for Louisiana smokers. The court’s final judgment also reflected its award of prejudgment interest. During February of 2007, the Louisiana Court of Appeal issued a ruling that, among other things, reduced the amount of the award by approximately $328 million; struck the award of prejudgment interest, which totaled approximately $440 million as of December 31, 2006; and ruled that the only class members who are eligible to participate in the smoking cessation program are those who began smoking by September 1, 1988, and whose claims accrued by September 1, 1988. The Louisiana Court of Appeal has returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. During January of 2008, the Louisiana Supreme Court denied plaintiffs’ and defendants’ separate petitions for review. Lorillard’s share of any judgment has not been determined. It is possible that post-judgment interest could be assessed on any award to the class that survives appeal. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Lorillard recorded a pretax provision of approximately $66 million for this matter. It is possible that the parties will seek further review of this decision. For additional information on the Scott case, please read Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.  The verdict returned in the federal government’s reimbursement case, while not final, could impose significant financial burdens on Lorillard and adversely affect future sales and profits.  During August of 2006, a final judgment and remedial order was entered in United States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al. (U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, filed September 22, 1999). The court based its final judgment and remedial order on the government’s only remaining claims, which were based on the defendants’ alleged violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”). Lorillard is one of the defendants in the case. Although the verdict did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff, the final judgment and remedial order granted equitable relief and imposes a number of requirements on the defendants. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, corrective statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking. The remedial order also would place certain prohibitions on the manner in which defendants market their cigarette products and would eliminate any use of “lights” or similar product descriptors. It is likely that the remedial order, including the prohibitions on the use of the descriptors relating to low tar cigarettes, will negatively affect Lorillard’s future sales and profits. Defendants, including Lorillard, have noticed appeals from the final judgment and the remedial order. Plaintiff also has noticed an appeal from the final judgment. Defendants have received a stay of the judgment and remedial order from the District of Columbia Court of Appeal that will remain in effect while the appeal is proceeding. As a result of the government’s appeal, it is possible that certain of the government’s claims or damages could be reinstated. While trial was underway, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that plaintiff may not seek disgorgement of profits, but this appeal was interlocutory in nature and could be reconsidered in the present appeal. Prior to trial, the government had estimated that it was entitled to approximately $280.0 billion from the defendants for its disgorgement of profits claim. In addition, the government sought during trial more than $10.0 billion for the creation of nationwide smoking cessation, public education and counter-marketing programs. In its 2006 verdict, the trial court declined to award such relief. It is possible that these claims could be reinstated on appeal. Please read Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation.       41          Item 1A. Risk Factors    Lorillard is a defendant in a case that has been certified as a nationwide class action involving “lights” cigarettes and that could result in a substantial verdict.  Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al. (U.S. District Court, Eastern District, New York, filed May 11, 2004), has been certified by a federal judge as a nationwide class action on behalf of individuals who purchased “lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs’ claims in Schwab are based on defendants’ alleged RICO violations in the manufacture, marketing and sale of “lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs have estimated damages to the class to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Any damages awarded to the plaintiffs based on defendants’ violation of the RICO statute would be trebled. The federal court of appeals has agreed to review the class certification order, and it has stayed all activity before the trial court until the appeal is concluded. Please read Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation.  The Florida Supreme Court’s ruling in Engle has resulted in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard.  The case of Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al. (Circuit Court, Dade County, Florida, filed May 5, 1994) was certified as a class action on behalf of Florida residents, and survivors of Florida residents, who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction to smoking. The case was tried between 1998-2000 in a multi-phase trial that resulted in verdicts in favor of the class. During 2006, the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that, among other things determined that the case could not proceed further as a class action. During February 2008, the trial court entered an order on remand from the Florida Supreme Court that formally decertified the class.  The 2006 ruling by the Florida Supreme Court in Engle also permits members of the Engle class to file individual claims, including claims for punitive damages. Lorillard refers to these cases as the Engle Progeny Cases. The Florida Supreme Court held that these individual plaintiffs are entitled to rely on a number of the jury’s findings in favor of the plaintiffs in the first phase of the Engle trial. These findings included that smoking cigarettes causes a number of diseases; that cigarettes are addictive or dependence-producing; and that the defendants, including Lorillard, were negligent, breached express and implied warranties, placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous, and concealed or conspired to conceal the risks of smoking. Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 1,050 cases filed by members of the Engle class. These 1,050 cases are on behalf of approximately 3,000 individual plaintiffs. These cases are pending in various Florida courts. The period for filing the Engle Progeny Cases expired during January 2008, but Florida law permits plaintiffs 120 days after a suit has been initiated to effect service. As a result, the final number of Engle Progeny Cases is not yet known. For additional information on the Engle Progeny Cases, please read Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.  The U.S. Surgeon General has issued a report regarding the risks of cigarette smoking to non-smokers that could result in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, additional restrictions placed on the use of cigarettes, and additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes.  In a report entitled “The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General, 2006,” the U.S. Surgeon General summarized conclusions from previous Surgeon General’s reports concerning the health effects of exposure to second-hand smoke by non-smokers. According to this report, scientific evidence now supports six major conclusions:          ·   Second-hand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke.              ·   Children exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections and ear problems.              ·   Exposure of adults to second-hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes heart disease and lung cancer.              ·   The scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to second-hand smoke.              ·   Many millions of Americans, both children and adults, are exposed to second-hand smoke in their homes and workplaces.           42          Item 1A. Risk Factors            ·   Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects non-smokers from exposure to second-hand smoke. Separating smokers from non-smokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of non-smokers to second-hand smoke.      This report could form the basis of additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard. The report could be used to support existing litigation against Lorillard or other cigarette manufacturers. It also is possible that the Surgeon General’s report could result in additional restrictions placed on cigarette smoking or in additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes. It is possible that such additional restrictions or regulations could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States, including sales of Lorillard brands. These developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  Lorillard has substantial payment obligations under litigation settlement agreements which will materially adversely affect its cash flows and operating income in future periods.  In 1998, Lorillard, Philip Morris Incorporated, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (the “Original Participating Manufacturers”) entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (the “MSA”) with 46 states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims.  Under the State Settlement Agreements, Lorillard paid $945 million in 2007 and is obligated to pay approximately $1,050 million to $1,100 million in 2008, primarily based on 2007 estimated industry volume. Annual payments under the State Settlement Agreements are required to be paid in perpetuity and are based, among other things, on Lorillard’s domestic market share and unit volume of domestic shipments in the year preceding the year in which payment is due. Please read Note 21 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for additional information regarding the State Settlement Agreements.  Concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely affect Lorillard.  Some plaintiffs and other sources, including among others, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, have claimed that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks than non-mentholated cigarettes. If such claims were to be substantiated, Lorillard, as the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes in the United States, could face increased exposure to tobacco-related litigation. Even if those claims are not substantiated, increased concerns about the health impact of mentholated cigarettes could adversely affect Lorillard’s sales, including sales of Newport. Some critics of mentholated cigarettes have called for a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes. Any ban or limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would adversely effect our results of operation and financial condition.  Lorillard is subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes that could harm its competitive position.  Television and radio advertisements of tobacco products have been prohibited since 1971. Under the State Settlement Agreements, Lorillard generally cannot use billboard advertising, cartoon characters, sponsorship of concerts, non-tobacco merchandise bearing its brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques. In addition, the MSA prohibits the targeting of youth in advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products. Accordingly, Lorillard has determined not to advertise its cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of 18. Additional restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future. These limitations may make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if sales or market share decline for any reason. Moreover, these limitations significantly impair the ability of cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard, to launch new premium brands.  Sales of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes.  Federal excise taxes were last increased in 2002 from $0.34 per pack to $0.39 per pack. A provision in a bill passed by Congress in 2007 to expand the Children’s Health Insurance Program would have raised the federal excise tax by $0.61 per pack, but that bill was vetoed by President Bush in December of 2007 and was not enacted into law. It is expected that an increase in Federal excise taxes will be introduced by Congress again in 2008. State and local excise taxes ranged from $0.07 to $3.66 per pack in 2007. Various states and localities have raised the excise tax on cigarettes substantially       43          Item 1A. Risk Factors    in recent years. It is Lorillard’s expectation that several states will propose further increases in 2008 and in subsequent years. Lorillard believes that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including Lorillard, and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands.  Lorillard is dependent on the domestic cigarette business, which it expects to continue to contract.  Lorillard’s domestic cigarette business is currently its only significant business. The domestic cigarette market has generally been contracting and Lorillard expects it to continue to contract. Lorillard does not have foreign cigarette sales that could offset these effects, as Lorillard sold the international rights to substantially all of its brands, including Newport, in 1977. As a result of price increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti-tobacco groups and other factors, domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound annual rate of approximately 2.5% during the period 1998 through 2007, as measured by Management Science Associates, Inc. (“MSAI”). Domestic U.S. cigarette industry shipments decreased by 5.0% during 2007, as compared to 2006, and 1.5% for 2006, as compared to 2005, according to information provided by MSAI.  Lorillard derives most of its revenue from one brand.  Lorillard’s largest selling brand, Newport, accounted for approximately 93.9% of Lorillard’s sales revenue in 2007. Lorillard’s principal strategic plan revolves around the marketing and sales promotion in support of its Newport brand. Lorillard cannot ensure that it will continue to successfully implement its strategic plan with respect to Newport or that implementation of its strategic plan will result in the maintenance or growth of the Newport brand.  The use of significant amounts of promotion expenses and sales incentives in response to competitive actions and market price sensitivity may have a material adverse impact on Lorillard.  Since 1998, the cigarette market has been very price competitive due to the impact of, among other things, higher state and local excise taxes and the market share of deep discount brands. In response to these and other competitor actions and pricing pressures, Lorillard has engaged in significant use of promotional expenses and sales incentives. The cost of these measures could have a material adverse impact on Lorillard. Lorillard regularly reviews the results of its promotional spending activities and adjusts its promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain its competitive position. Accordingly, unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent periods.  Several of Lorillard’s competitors have developed alternative cigarette products.  Certain of the major cigarette makers are marketing alternative cigarette products. For example, Philip Morris has developed an alternative cigarette called Accord in which the tobacco is heated rather than burned. RAI has developed an alternative cigarette called Eclipse in which the tobacco is primarily heated, with only a small amount of tobacco burned. Vector Tobacco Inc. is marketing a cigarette offered in several packings with declining levels of nicotine, called Quest. Philip Morris and RAI have indicated that these products may deliver fewer smoke components as compared to conventional cigarettes. Lorillard has not marketed similar alternative cigarettes. Should such alternative cigarette products gain a significant share of the domestic cigarette market, Lorillard may be at a competitive disadvantage.  Lorillard may not be able to develop, produce or commercialize competitive new products and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer preferences.  Consumer health concerns and changes in regulations are likely to require Lorillard to introduce new products or make substantial changes to existing products. For example, 22 states have enacted legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to reduce the ignition propensity of their products. Lorillard believes that there may be increasing pressure from public health authorities to develop a conventional cigarette or an alternative cigarette that provides a demonstrable reduced risk of adverse health effects. Lorillard may not be able to develop a reduced risk product that is acceptable to consumers. In addition, the costs associated with developing any such new products and technologies could be substantial.       44          Item 1A. Risk Factors    The availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect Lorillard’s sales.  Sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the United States, including counterfeits of Lorillard’s Newport brand, could adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of the brands that are counterfeited and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands. The availability of counterfeit Newport cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on Lorillard’s sales volumes, revenue and profits.  Lorillard relies on a single manufacturing facility for the production of its cigarettes.  Lorillard produces all of its cigarettes at its Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing facility. If Lorillard’s manufacturing plant is damaged, destroyed or incapacitated or Lorillard is otherwise unable to operate its manufacturing facility, Lorillard may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable to meet customer demand.  Lorillard relies on a small number of suppliers for certain of its tobacco leaf.  Lorillard purchases more than 90% of its domestic leaf tobacco from one supplier, Alliance One International, Inc. In addition, Lorillard purchases all of its reconstituted tobacco from one supplier, which is an affiliate of RAI, a major competitor of Lorillard. If either of these suppliers becomes unwilling or unable to supply Lorillard and Lorillard is unable to find an alternative supplier on a timely basis, Lorillard’s operations could be disrupted resulting in lower production levels and reduced sales.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide. Worldwide demand for oil and gas, oil and gas prices, market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity. However, higher commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into increased drilling activity since Diamond Offshore’s customers’ expectations of future commodity demand and prices typically drive demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, including:          ·   worldwide demand for oil and gas;              ·   the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing;              ·   the level of production in non-OPEC countries;              ·   the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities in the Middle East, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas, further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;              ·   the worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as recessions;              ·   the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;              ·   the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;              ·   the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;              ·   available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity;           45          Item 1A. Risk Factors            ·   the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;              ·   weather conditions in the United States and elsewhere;              ·   the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;              ·   development and exploitation of alternative fuels;              ·   domestic and foreign tax policy; and              ·   advances in exploration and development technology.      Diamond Offshore’s industry is cyclical.  Diamond Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates (such as Diamond Offshore is currently experiencing in virtually all of the markets in which it operates), followed by periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time.  Growing worldwide demand for crude oil and natural gas has caused current oil and natural gas prices to rise significantly above historical averages, which has generally resulted in higher utilization and dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s drilling units, generally since the third quarter of 2004. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that the current industry cycle of high demand, short rig supply and higher dayrates will continue. Diamond Offshore may be required to idle rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts in response to market conditions in the future.  Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.  Failure to obtain and retain highly skilled personnel could hurt Diamond Offshore’s operations.  Diamond Offshore requires highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for Diamond Offshore’s business. To the extent that demand for drilling services and the size of the worldwide industry fleet increase (including the impact of newly constructed rigs), shortages of qualified personnel could arise, creating upward pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing and servicing its rigs, which could adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s results of operations. In addition, the entrance of new participants into the offshore drilling market would cause further competition for qualified and experienced personnel as these entities seek to hire personnel with expertise in the offshore drilling industry.  Diamond Offshore has experienced and continues to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages and increased competition for skilled workers as a result of the strengthening offshore drilling market. Diamond Offshore has also sustained the loss of experienced personnel to its competitors and its customers. In response to these market conditions Diamond Offshore has implemented retention programs, including increases in compensation. The heightened competition for skilled personnel could adversely impact Diamond Offshore’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows by limiting operations or further increasing costs.  The terms of some of Diamond Offshore’s dayrate drilling contracts may limit its ability to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market.  The duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and, to a lesser extent, the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractors. In periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors typically prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level. Conversely, in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, contractors generally prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of lower dayrates.       46          Item 1A. Risk Factors    Typically, as a period of high dayrates and utilization lengthens, customers who perceive a continuing long term need for equipment begin to seek increasingly long-term contracts, but often at flat or slightly lower dayrates in exchange for the term length. To the extent possible within the scope of Diamond Offshore’s customer’s requirements, Diamond Offshore seeks to have a foundation of these long-term contracts with a reasonable balance of shorter-term exposure to the spot market in an attempt to maintain upside potential while endeavoring to limit the downside impact of a potential decline in the market. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain such a balance from time to time. Diamond Offshore’s inability to fully benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market, due to the long-term nature of some of its contracts, may adversely affect profitability.  The majority of Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability of those contracts.  Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred. Many of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, Diamond Offshore may be unable to recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers.  Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control.  Diamond Offshore’s customers may terminate some of their drilling contracts if the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts. These termination payments may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time. During depressed market conditions, Diamond Offshore’s customers may also seek renegotiation of firm drilling contracts to reduce their obligations.  Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that Diamond Offshore’s current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.  As of the date of this report, Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog was approximately $11 billion for expected future work extending, in some cases, until 2015, which includes future earnings under both firm commitments and, in a few instances, anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been executed. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that Diamond Offshore will be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control or that Diamond Offshore will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement where one does not currently exist. Diamond Offshore’s inability to perform under our contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Diamond Offshore” included in Item 7 of this report.  Rig conversions, upgrades or new builds may be subject to delays and cost overruns.  From time to time, Diamond Offshore may undertake to add new capacity through conversions or upgrades to rigs or through new construction. Diamond Offshore is currently upgrading one of its drilling units, the Ocean Monarch, to ultra-deepwater capability at an estimated aggregate cost of $305 million. Diamond Offshore expects delivery of the upgraded Ocean Monarch during the fourth quarter of 2008. Diamond Offshore also has entered into agreements to construct two new jack-up drilling units with delivery expected in the second quarter of 2008 at an aggregate cost of approximately $320 million, including drillpipe and capitalized interest. These projects and other projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:       47          Item 1A. Risk Factors            ·   shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;              ·   work stoppages;              ·   unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;              ·   unanticipated cost increases;              ·   weather interferences;              ·   difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;              ·   design and engineering problems;              ·   customer acceptance delays;              ·   shipyard failures or unavailablity; and              ·   failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes.      Failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract, resulting in a loss of revenue to Diamond Offshore. If a drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances, Diamond Offshore may not be able to secure replacement contract on as favorable terms.  Diamond Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards and Diamond Offshore is not fully insured against all of them.  Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, punchthroughs, craterings and natural disasters such as hurricanes or fires. The occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations and environmental damage. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. In addition, offshore drilling operators are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Damage to the environment could also result from our operations, particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires. Diamond Offshore may also be subject to damage claims by oil and gas companies or other parties.  Pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable, and Diamond Offshore does not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover its rigs. Diamond Offshore’s insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover its losses, or may have exclusions of coverage for some losses. Diamond Offshore does not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks, including, among other things, liability risk for certain amounts of excess coverage and certain physical damage risk. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will necessarily be financially able to indemnify it against all these risks. In addition, no assurance can be made that Diamond Offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that it will be able to obtain insurance against some risks.  Diamond Offshore is self-insured for a portion of physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  For physical damage due to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as of the date of this report Diamond Offshore’s deductible is $75 million per occurrence (or lower for some rigs if they are declared a constructive total loss)       48          Item 1A. Risk Factors    with an annual aggregate limit of $125 million. Accordingly, Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage for all physical damage to its rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the policy period ending April 30, 2008 is limited to $125 million. If named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause significant damage to Diamond Offshore’s rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Diamond Offshore’s international operations involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations.  Diamond Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world that may expose it to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:          ·   terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances;              ·   piracy or assaults on property or personnel;              ·   kidnapping of personnel;              ·   expropriation of property or equipment;              ·   renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;              ·   changing political conditions;              ·   foreign and domestic monetary policies;              ·   the inability to repatriate income or capital;              ·   regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;              ·   travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats; and              ·   changing taxation policies.      In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and regulations relating to:          ·   the equipping and operation of drilling units;              ·   repatriation of foreign earnings;              ·   oil and gas exploration and development;              ·   taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and              ·   use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.      Some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors, require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These practices may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete in those regions. It is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments, including initiatives by OPEC, may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete.       49          Item 1A. Risk Factors    Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts offshore Mexico expose it to greater risks than they normally assume.  As of the date of this report, Diamond Offshore has three intermediate semisubmersible rigs and two jack-up rigs drilling offshore Mexico for PEMEX - Exploracion Y Produccion (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico. The terms of these contracts expose Diamond Offshore to greater risks than they normally assume, such as exposure to greater environmental liability, and can be terminated by PEMEX on short term notice, contractually or by statute, subject to certain conditions. While Diamond Offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating safeguards in place mitigate these risks, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a negative impact on our future operations or financial results.  Fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses.  Due to Diamond Offshore’s international operations, Diamond Offshore may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. Diamond Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise.  Diamond Offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings.  Certain of Diamond Offshore’s international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited, a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary. Since forming this subsidiary it has been Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary to finance foreign operations. During 2007, this subsidiary made a non-recurring distribution to its U.S. parent company, and Diamond Offshore recognized U.S. federal income tax expense on the portion of the distribution that consisted of earnings of the subsidiary that had not previously been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. As of December 31, 2007, the amount of previously untaxed earnings of this subsidiary was zero. Notwithstanding the non-recurring distribution made in December 2007, it remains Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest the future earnings of the subsidiary to finance foreign activities. Diamond Offshore does not expect to provide for U.S. taxes on any future earnings generated by the subsidiary, except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to U.S. federal income tax. Should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of Diamond Offshore’s subsidiary, it may be required to record additional U.S. income taxes that, if material, could have an adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, HighMount Exploration & Production LLC  HighMount may not be able to replace reserves and sustain production at current levels. Replacing reserves is risky and uncertain and requires significant capital expenditures.  HighMount’s future success depends largely upon its ability to find, develop or acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless HighMount replaces the reserves produced through successful development, exploration or acquisition, its proved reserves will decline over time. HighMount may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future or to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs.  By their nature, undeveloped reserves are less certain. Thus, HighMount must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of reserves. HighMount expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from its operating activities. If HighMount’s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund its capital expenditure budget, there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available or available at favorable terms to meet those requirements.  Estimates of natural gas and NGL reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise.  Estimating the volume of proved natural gas and NGL reserves is a complex process and is not an exact science because of numerous uncertainties inherent in the process. The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The       50          Item 1A. Risk Factors    process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of:          ·   the quality and quantity of available data;              ·   the interpretation of that data;              ·   the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and              ·   the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.      Actual future production, commodity prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves most likely will vary from HighMount’s estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of HighMount’s reserves. In addition, HighMount may adjust estimates of proved reserves upward or downward to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling and prevailing commodity prices.  The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and NGL properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10.0% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times, and the risks associated with our business, or the oil and gas industry in general, will affect the accuracy of the 10.0% discount factor.  If commodity prices decrease, HighMount may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of its properties.  HighMount may be required, under full cost accounting rules, to write down the carrying value of its natural gas and NGL properties if commodity prices decline significantly, or if it makes substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves, or increases its estimates of development costs or experiences deterioration in its exploration results. HighMount utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities. Under full cost accounting, HighMount is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or “ceiling,” of the book value of HighMount’s natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value (discounted at the required rate of 10.0%) of the future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges, calculated using prevailing prices on the last day of the period.  If the net book value of HighMount’s exploration and production (“E&P”) properties (reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability) exceeds its ceiling limitation, SEC regulations require HighMount to impair or “write down” the book value of its E&P properties. A write down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and NGL prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Depending on the magnitude of any future impairment, a ceiling test write down could significantly reduce HighMount’s income, or produce a loss. As ceiling test computations involve the prevailing price on the last day of the quarter, it is impossible to predict the timing and magnitude of any future impairment.  Drilling for and producing natural gas and NGLs is a high risk activity with many uncertainties.  HighMount’s future success will depend in part on the success of its exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. HighMount’s E&P activities are subject to numerous risks beyond its control, including the risk that drilling will not result in oil and natural gas production volumes that are commercially viable. HighMount’s decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. HighMount’s cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following:       51          Item 1A. Risk Factors            ·   lack of acceptable prospective acreage;              ·   inadequate capital resources;              ·   unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents;              ·   adverse weather conditions;              ·   unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, labor or services;              ·   reductions in commodity prices;              ·   limitations in the market for natural gas and NGLs;              ·   title problems;              ·   compliance with governmental regulations; and              ·   mechanical difficulties.      HighMount’s business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.  HighMount is not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect HighMount’s business, financial condition or results of operations. HighMount’s E&P activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing natural gas and NGLs, including the possibility of:          ·   environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;              ·   abnormally pressured formations;              ·   mechanical difficulties, such as stuck drilling and service tools and casing collapse;              ·   fires and explosions;              ·   personal injuries and death; and              ·   natural disasters.      If any of these events occur, HighMount could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life, damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, suspension of HighMount’s operations and repairs to resume operations, any of which could adversely affect its ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses. HighMount may elect not to obtain insurance, if the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.  HighMount engages in commodity price hedging activities.  HighMount is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in commodity prices. The extent of HighMount’s commodity price risk is related to the effectiveness and scope of HighMount’s hedging activities. To the extent HighMount hedges its commodity price risk, HighMount will forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in its favor. Furthermore, because HighMount has entered into       52          Item 1A. Risk Factors    derivative transactions related to only a portion of the volume of its expected natural gas supply and production of NGLs, HighMount will continue to have direct commodity price risk on the unhedged portion. HighMount’s actual future supply and production may be significantly higher or lower than HighMount estimates at the time it enters into derivative transactions for that period.  As a result, HighMount’s hedging activities may not be as effective as HighMount intends in reducing the volatility of its cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of cash flows. In addition, even though HighMount’s management monitors its hedging activities, these activities can result in substantial losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement, the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective, or HighMount’s hedging policies and procedures are not properly followed or do not work as planned.  Natural gas, NGL and other commodity prices are volatile.  The commodity price HighMount receives for its production heavily influences its revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. HighMount is subject to risks due to frequent and often substantial fluctuations in commodity prices. NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and HighMount expects this volatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond HighMount’s control. These factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including:          ·   the impact of market and basis differentials - market price spreads between two points across Highmount’s natural gas system;              ·   the impact of weather on the demand for these commodities;              ·   the level of domestic production and imports of these commodities;              ·   natural gas storage levels;              ·   actions taken by foreign producing nations;              ·   the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems;              ·   the availability and marketing of competitive fuels;              ·   the impact of energy conservation efforts; and              ·   the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.      Lower commodity prices may decrease HighMount’s revenues and may reduce the amount of natural gas and NGLs that HighMount can produce economically.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP  Boardwalk Pipeline is undertaking large, complex expansion projects which involve significant risks that may adversely affect its business.  Boardwalk Pipeline is currently undertaking several large, complex pipeline expansion projects and it may consider additional expansion projects in the future. In pursuing these projects, Boardwalk Pipeline has experienced significant cost overruns, including penalties to contractors, and may experience additional cost increases in the future. Boardwalk Pipeline has also experienced construction delays and may experience additional delays in the future. Delays in construction have resulted in reduced transportation rates and liquidated damage payments to customers, as well as lost revenue opportunities and could, in the future result in similar losses or, in some cases, provide customers the right to terminate their transportation agreements relating to the delayed project.       53          Item 1A. Risk Factors    These cost overruns and construction delays have resulted from a variety of factors, including the following:          ·   delays in obtaining regulatory approvals;              ·   adverse weather conditions;              ·   delays in obtaining key materials; and              ·   shortages of qualified labor and escalating costs of labor and materials resulting from the high level of construction activity in the pipeline industry.      In pursuing current or future expansion projects, Boardwalk Pipeline could experience additional delays or cost increases for the reasons described above or as a result of other factors beyond its control. It may not be able to complete its current or future expansion projects on the terms, at the cost, or under the schedule that they anticipate, or at all. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline cannot be certain that, if completed, these projects will perform in accordance with their expectations and other areas of their business may suffer as a result of the diversion of management’s attention and other resources from other business concerns. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from expansion projects. Please read Item 1, “Business – Boardwalk Pipeline Partners – Expansion Projects.”  Completion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s expansion projects will require significant amounts of debt and equity financing which may not be available to it on acceptable terms, or at all.  Boardwalk Pipeline plans to fund its expansion capital expenditures with proceeds from sales of its debt and equity securities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. However, Boardwalk Pipeline cannot be certain that it will be able to issue debt and equity securities on terms or in the proportions that it expects, or at all, particularly in light of the cost increases and construction delays experienced to date on its expansion projects, current credit market disruptions surrounding sub-prime residential mortgage concerns and the impact that those factors and other events are having and may have on the public securities markets generally and on the market for Boardwalk Pipeline’s securities in particular. A significant increase in indebtedness, or an increase in indebtedness that is proportionately greater than its issuances of equity, as well as the project cost increases and credit market conditions discussed above could negatively impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s credit ratings or its ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under its revolving credit agreement. If Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to finance its expansion projects as expected, it could be required to seek alternative financing, the terms of which may not be attractive to it, or to revise or cancel its expansion plans.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to FERC rate-making policies.  Action by the FERC on currently pending matters as well as matters arising in the future could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to establish reasonable rates, or to charge rates that would cover future increases in Boardwalk Pipeline’s costs, or even to continue to collect rates to maintain Boardwalk Pipeline’s current revenue levels that cover current costs, including a reasonable return. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot make assurances that it will be able to recover all of its costs through existing or future rates.  In 2005, FERC established a policy regarding the ability of a regulated entity to collect an allowance for income taxes in its cost of service. Generally, FERC has stated it will permit a pipeline that is a partnership (or other pass-through entity) to include in its cost-of-service an income tax allowance to the extent that its partners have an actual or potential income tax liability on the jurisdictional income generated by the partnership (or other pass-through entity). FERC will review pipelines’ ability to include such an income tax allowance in their costs of service on a case-by-case basis, and the burden is on the pipelines to show that it had such actual or potential income tax liability. That policy has been further refined in 2006 and 2007 through a series of FERC orders and decisions issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Most recently, FERC’s income tax allowance policy was upheld on all issues subject to appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a decision issued in May 2007. In December 2007, FERC issued an order that again affirmed its income tax allowance policy and further clarified the implementation of that policy. If the FERC were to change its income tax allowance policy in the future, such changes could materially and adversely impact the rates Boardwalk Pipeline is permitted to charge as future rates are approved for its interstate transportation services.       54          Item 1A. Risk Factors    In a related interstate oil pipeline proceeding, FERC noted that the tax deferral features of a publicly traded partnership may cause some investors to receive, for some indeterminate duration, cash distributions in excess of their taxable income, which FERC characterized as a “tax savings.” FERC stated a concern that this creates an opportunity for those investors to earn an additional equity return funded by ratepayers. Responding to this concern, FERC adjusted the pipeline’s equity rate of return downward based on the percentage by which the publicly traded partnership’s cash flow exceeded taxable income assumed in the methodology for calculating the rate of return. A rehearing request is pending before FERC on this issue. If FERC establishes a policy of lowering a regulated entities’ equity rate of return to compensate for what it considers to be a “tax savings,” it is also likely that the level of maximum lawful rates would decrease from current levels.  If a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline were to file a rate case or if Boardwalk Pipeline was to be required to defend its rates, Boardwalk Pipeline would be required to establish pursuant to the income tax policy statement that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in its cost of service was just and reasonable. To establish that its tax allowance is just and reasonable, Boardwalk Pipeline’s general partner may elect to require owners of Boardwalk Pipeline’s units to recertify their status as being subject to United States federal income taxation on the income generated by Texas Gas or Gulf South. Boardwalk Pipeline can provide no assurance that the certification and re-certification procedures provided in Boardwalk Pipeline’s partnership agreement will be sufficient to establish that its unitholders, or its unitholders’ owners, are subject to United States federal income taxation on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline. If Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to establish that the master partnership’s unitholders, or its unitholders’ owners, are subject to United States federal income tax liability on the income generated by the jurisdictional pipelines, the FERC could disallow a substantial portion of Texas Gas’ or Gulf South’s income tax allowance. If the FERC were to disallow a substantial portion of Texas Gas’ or Gulf South’s income tax allowance, it is likely that the level of maximum lawful rates could decrease from current levels.  The outcome of certain FERC proceedings involving FERC policy statements is uncertain and could affect the level of return on equity that Boardwalk Pipeline may be able to achieve in any future rate proceeding.  In an effort to provide some guidance and to obtain further public comment on FERC’s policies concerning return on equity determinations, on July 19, 2007, FERC issued its Proposed Proxy Policy Statement, Composition of Proxy Groups for Determining Gas and Oil Pipeline Return on Equity. In the Proposed Proxy Policy Statement, FERC proposes to permit inclusion of publicly traded partnerships in the proxy group analysis relating to return on equity determinations in rate proceedings, provided that the analysis be limited to actual publicly traded partnership distributions capped at the level of the pipeline’s earnings and that evidence be provided in the form of multiyear analysis of past earnings demonstrating a publicly traded partnership’s ability to provide stable earnings over time.  In a decision issued shortly after FERC issued its Proposed Proxy Policy Statement, the D.C. Circuit vacated FERC’s orders in proceeding involving High Island Offshore System and Petal Gas Storage. The Court determined that FERC had failed to adequately reflect risks of interstate pipeline operations both in populating the proxy group (from which a range of equity returns was determined) with entities the record indicated had lower risk, while excluding publicly traded partnerships primarily engaged in interstate pipeline operations, and in the placement of the pipeline under review in each proceeding within that range of equity returns. Although the Court accepted for the sake of argument FERC’s rationale for excluding publicly traded partnerships from the proxy group (i.e., publicly traded partnership distributions may exceed earnings) it observed this proposition was “not self-evident.”  The ultimate outcome of these proceedings is not certain and may result in new policies being established at FERC that would not allow the full use of publicly traded partnership distributions to unitholders in any proxy group comparisons or other negative adjustments used to determine return on equity in future rate proceedings. In addition, the FERC may adopt other policies or institute other proceedings that could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to achieve a reasonable level of return on equity in any future rate proceeding.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which Boardwalk Pipeline may not be adequately insured.  There are a variety of operating risks inherent in Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems, all of which could cause substantial financial losses. Any       55          Item 1A. Risk Factors    of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations and substantial revenue losses. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.  Boardwalk Pipeline currently possesses property, business interruption and general liability insurance, but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms.  Because of the natural decline in gas production from existing wells, Boardwalk Pipeline’s success depends on its ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas.  For the years 2003 to 2006, gas production from the Gulf Coast region, which supplies the majority of Boardwalk Pipeline’s throughput, has declined an average of approximately 13.0% per year according to the Energy Information Administration. A large part of this decline was due to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot give any assurance regarding the gas production industry’s ability to find new sources of domestic supply. Production from existing wells and gas supply basins connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems will naturally decline further over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates, or the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates. Accordingly, to maintain or increase throughput levels on its pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline must continually obtain access to new supplies of natural gas. The primary factors affecting Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to obtain new sources of natural gas to its pipelines include: (1) the level of successful drilling activity near Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines; (2) Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for these supplies; (3) the successful completion of new liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) facilities near Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities; and (4) Boardwalk Pipeline’s gas quality requirements.  The level of drilling activity is dependent on a number of factors beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. The primary factor that impacts drilling decisions is the price of oil and natural gas. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the fields served or to be served by Boardwalk Pipeline, which would lead to reduced throughput levels on its pipelines. Other factors that impact production decisions include producers’ capital budget limitations, the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits, the availability and cost of drilling rigs and other drilling equipment, and regulatory changes. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves were discovered in areas served by Boardwalk Pipeline, producers may choose not to develop those reserves or may connect them to different pipelines.  Imported LNG is expected to be a significant component of future natural gas supply to the United States. Much of this increase in LNG supply is expected to be imported through new LNG facilities to be developed over the next decade. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot predict which, if any, of these projects will be constructed. If a significant number of these new projects fail to be developed with their announced capacity, or there are significant delays in such development, or if they are built in locations where they are not connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems or they do not influence sources of supply on its systems, Boardwalk Pipeline may not realize expected increases in future natural gas supply available for transportation through its systems.   If Boardwalk Pipeline is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply basins, or if the expected increase in natural gas supply through imported LNG is not realized, throughput on its pipeline systems would decline.  Successful development of LNG import terminals in the eastern or northeastern United States could reduce the demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services.  Development of new, or expansion of existing, LNG facilities on the East Coast could reduce the need for customers in the northeastern United States to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast and other supply basins connected to the Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems. This could reduce the amount of gas transported by Boardwalk Pipeline for delivery off-system to other interstate pipelines serving the northeast. If Boardwalk Pipeline is not able to replace these volumes with volumes to other markets or other regions, throughput on its pipeline systems will decline.       56          Item 1A. Risk Factors     Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time existing transportation contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 25.0% of the firm contract load on Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems, excluding agreements related to the expansion projects, was due to expire on or before December 31, 2008. Upon expiration, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long term basis. A key determinant of the value that customers can realize from firm transportation on a pipeline is the basis differential, which can be affected by, among other things, the availability of supply, available capacity, storage inventories, weather and general market demand in the respective areas.  The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control, including:          ·   existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to Boardwalk Pipeline’s markets;              ·   the growth in demand for natural gas in Boardwalk Pipeline’s markets;              ·   whether the market will continue to support long term contracts;              ·   the current basis differentials or market price spreads between two points across the Boardwalk Pipeline systems;              ·   whether Boardwalk Pipeline’s business strategy continues to be successful; and              ·   the effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices.      Boardwalk Pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues.  Boardwalk Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2007, Atmos Energy accounted for approximately 10.0% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s total operating revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of these contracts and those with other key customers on favorable terms as a result of competition, creditworthiness or for other reasons.  Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers.  Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to credit risk from the nonperformance by its customers of their contractual obligations, in large part relating to volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned to them, generally under parking and lending services and no-notice services. If any significant customer of Boardwalk Pipeline should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas they owe Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Please read information on credit risk included in Credit Risk under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  Boardwalk Pipeline depends on third party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to its pipelines  Boardwalk Pipeline depends upon third party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from its pipelines. For example, Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline system can deliver approximately 500 MMcf per day to a major pipeline connection with Texas Eastern at Kosciusko, Mississippi. If this or any other pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect could cause a material reduction in volumes transported on or stored at facilities of Boardwalk Pipeline.       57          Item 1A. Risk Factors    Significant changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand, and reduce system throughput.  Higher natural gas prices could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in the throughput on the Boardwalk Pipeline systems. In addition, reduced price volatility could reduce the revenues generated by Boardwalk Pipeline’s parking and lending and interruptible storage services. In general terms, the price of natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in supply, changes in demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. These factors include:          ·   worldwide economic conditions;              ·   weather conditions and seasonal trends;              ·   levels of domestic production and consumer demand;              ·   the availability of LNG;              ·   a material decrease in the price of natural gas could have an adverse effect on the shippers who have contracted for capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s planned expansion projects;              ·   the availability of adequate transportation capacity;              ·   the price and availability of alternative fuels;              ·   the effect of energy conservation measures;              ·   the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation; and              ·   the anticipated future prices of natural gas, LNG and other commodities.      Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally  In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, terrorism, hurricanes and other natural disasters, competition, government regulation, dependence on key executives and employees, litigation, dependence on information technology and compliance with environmental laws.  Future acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.  Future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad, as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on the businesses of certain of our subsidiaries, including the following:  CNA. CNA continues to face exposure to losses arising from terrorist acts, despite the passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 extended, until December 31, 2014, the program established within the U.S. Department of Treasury by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. This program requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage and the federal government to share in insured losses arising from acts of terrorism. Given the unpredictability of the nature, targets, severity and frequency of potential terrorist acts, this program does not provide complete protection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism. Further, the laws of certain states restrict our ability to mitigate this residual exposure. For example, some states mandate property insurance coverage of damage from fire following a loss, thereby prohibiting CNA from excluding terrorism exposure. In addition, some states generally prohibit CNA from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers’ compensation policies. Consequently, there is substantial uncertainty as to CNA’s ability to contain its terrorism exposure effectively since CNA continues to issue forms of coverage, in particular, workers’ compensation, that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act.       58          Item 1A. Risk Factors    Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk Pipeline and HighMount. The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies might lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for oil and gas, which could affect the market for Diamond Offshore’s oil and gas offshore drilling services, Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering and storage services and HighMount’s natural gas exploration and production activities. In addition, it has been reported that terrorists might target domestic energy facilities. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to increase the security of their energy assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure their assets, completely protect them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.  Loews Hotels. The travel and tourism industry went into a steep decline in the periods following the 2001 World Trade Center event which had a negative impact on the occupancy levels and average room rates at Loews Hotels. Future terrorist attacks could similarly lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels.  Certain of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to the impact of hurricanes and other natural disasters.  In addition to CNA’s exposure to catastrophe losses discussed above, the businesses operated by several of our other subsidiaries are exposed to significant harm from the effects of natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and related flooding and other damage. While much of the damage caused by natural disasters is covered by insurance, we cannot be sure that such coverage will be available or be adequate in all cases. These risks include the following:  Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore operates its offshore rig fleet in waters that can be severely impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters, including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In late August 2005, one of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the Ocean Warwick, was seriously damaged during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in Diamond’s fleet and its warehouse in New Iberia, Louisiana sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, or in some cases both storms. In addition to damaging or destroying rig equipment, some or all of which may be covered by insurance, catastrophes of this kind result in additional operating expenses for Diamond Offshore, including the cost of reconnaissance aircraft, rig crew over-time and employee assistance, hurricane relief supplies, temporary housing and office space and the rental of mooring equipment and others which may not be covered by insurance.  Boardwalk Pipeline. The nature and location of Boardwalk Pipeline’s business, particularly with regard to its assets in the Gulf Coast region, may make Boardwalk Pipeline susceptible to catastrophic losses especially from hurricanes or named storms. Various other events can cause catastrophic losses, including windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, and severe winter weather and fires. The frequency and severity of these events are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves. Although Boardwalk Pipeline carries insurance, in the event of a loss the coverage could be insufficient or there could be a material delay in the receipt of the insurance proceeds.  Loews Hotels. Hotels operated by Loews Hotels are exposed to damage, business interruption and reductions in travel and tourism in markets affected by significant natural disasters such as hurricanes. For example, Loews Hotels’ properties located in Florida and New Orleans suffered significant damage from hurricanes and related flooding during the past three years.  Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations.  The businesses operated by certain of our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal, state and local governmental regulations which imposes or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies. Governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies. Risks faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following:  CNA. The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders rather than its investors. Each state in which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which CNA does business. Their regulations relate to, among other things:          ·   standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;           59          Item 1A. Risk Factors            ·   restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;              ·   restrictions on CNA’s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas;              ·   the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;              ·   the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;              ·   potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;              ·   licensing of insurers and agents;              ·   approval of policy forms;              ·   limitations on the ability of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and              ·   limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.      Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. CNA also is required by the states to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.  Lorillard. A bill that would grant the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products was introduced in Congress in February 2007. The bill is being supported by Philip Morris and opposed by Lorillard, RAI and most other tobacco manufacturers. It has been considered in hearings by Congressional committees in both houses of Congress during 2007, and one Senate committee has approved the bill with certain modifications. Lorillard is aware of reports that a subcommittee of the House of Representatives will likely schedule a hearing on this bill in early March of 2008. The proposed bill would:          ·   require larger and more severe health warnings on packs and cartons;              ·   ban the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as “low-tar” and “light”;              ·   require the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers;              ·   require pre-market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products;              ·   require the reduction or elimination of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes;              ·   allow the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes;              ·   allow the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sales of cigarettes;              ·   permit inconsistent state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation; and              ·   grant the FDA the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions.      In addition, some states have enacted or proposed regulations, including with respect to mandatory disclosure of ingredients, including flavorings, some of which are trade secrets. State and local laws or rules that prohibit or restrict smoking in public places and workplaces continue to be enacted and proposed. Lorillard cannot predict the ultimate       60          Item 1A. Risk Factors    impact of these laws or regulatory proposals, but believes they will continue to reduce sales and increase costs. Extensive and inconsistent regulation by multiple states could prove to be particularly disruptive to Lorillard’s business.  It is possible that such additional regulation could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States (including sales of Lorillard brands) and an increase in costs, to Lorillard, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We believe that such regulation may adversely affect Lorillard’s ability to compete against its larger competitors, including Philip Morris, who may be able to more quickly and cost-effectively comply with these new rules and regulations.  Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore’s operations are affected from time to time in varying degrees by governmental laws and regulations. The drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or may significantly limit drilling activity.  Governments in some foreign countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s operations by limiting drilling opportunities.  The Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, or MMS, has established guidelines for drilling operations in the GOM. Diamond Offshore believes that it is currently in compliance with the existing regulations set forth by the MMS with respect to its operations in the GOM; however, these regulations are continually under review. Implementation of additional MMS regulations may subject Diamond Offshore to increased costs of operating, or a reduction in the area and/or periods of operation, in the GOM.  HighMount. All of HighMount’s operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among other things: permits to drill and to conduct other operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; and the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area); the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties; maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells; venting or flaring of natural gas and the ratability of production.  HighMount’s operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants, and the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. In addition, HighMount’s operations may require it to obtain permits for, among other things, air emissions, discharges into surface waters, and the construction and operation of underground injection wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other non-hazardous oilfield wastes.  Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC and the United States Department of Transportation, among other federal and state authorities. In addition to the FERC rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its services, the FERC’s regulatory authority also extends to:          ·   operating terms and conditions of service;              ·   the types of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer to its customers;           61          Item 1A. Risk Factors            ·   construction of new facilities;              ·   acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;              ·   accounts and records; and              ·   relationships with affiliated companies involved in all aspects of the natural gas and electricity businesses.      The FERC action in any of these areas or modifications of its current regulations can adversely impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, the costs incurred in its operations, the construction of new facilities or Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. Another example is the time the FERC takes to approve the construction of new facilities, which could give Boardwalk Pipeline’s non-regulated competitors time to offer alternative projects or raise the costs of Boardwalk Pipeline’s projects to the point where they are no longer economical.  The United States Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has issued a final rule requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rule refers to as high consequence areas (“HCAs”) where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.  The businesses operated by our subsidiaries face intense competition.  Each of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries faces intense competition in its industry and will be harmed materially if it is unable to compete effectively. Certain of the competitive risks faced by those companies include:  CNA. All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. CNA may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  Lorillard. Lorillard competes primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. Lorillard is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its business. The competitive environment and Lorillard’s competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors’ introduction of low-priced products or innovative products, higher cigarette taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products.  Lorillard’s principal competitors are the two other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, Philip Morris and RAI. RAI was formed in 2004 as a result of the merger of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (now a wholly owned subsidiary of RAI) and the U.S. operations of Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of British American Tobacco p.l.c.). Lorillard also competes against numerous other smaller manufacturers or importers of cigarettes. If Lorillard’s major competitors were to significantly increase the level of price discounts offered to consumers, Lorillard could respond by increasing price discounts, which could have a materially adverse effect on its profitability and results of operations.  Diamond Offshore. The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than Diamond Offshore. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job, although rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered. Mergers among oil and gas exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available customers. The drilling industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors.       62          Item 1A. Risk Factors    HighMount. HighMount competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business, including acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining goods, services and labor, including drilling rigs and well completion services. HighMount also competes in the marketing of produced natural gas and NGLs. Some of HighMount’s competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than HighMount. Factors that affect HighMount’s ability to acquire producing properties include available funds, available information about the property and standards established by HighMount for minimum projected return on investment. Competition for sales of natural gas and NGLs is also presented by alternative fuel sources, including heating oil, imported liquefied natural gas and other fossil fuels.  Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline competes primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines in the transportation and storage of natural gas. Natural gas also competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The principal elements of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability. The FERC’s policies promoting competition in gas markets are having the effect of increasing the gas transportation options for Boardwalk Pipeline’s traditional customer base. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems or, in cases where Boardwalk Pipeline does not have long term fixed rate contracts, could force Boardwalk Pipeline to lower its transportation or storage rates. Competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that significantly decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, such as competing or alternative forms of energy, a recession or other adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes against a number of intrastate pipelines which have significant regulatory advantages over its and other interstate pipelines because of the absence of FERC regulation. In view of potential rate increases, construction and service flexibility available to intrastate pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline may lose customers and throughput to intrastate competitors.  We and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation.  We and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation in the normal course of business. Litigation is costly and time consuming to defend and could result in a material expense. Please read information on litigation included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Certain of the litigation risks faced by us and our subsidiaries are as follows:  CNA. CNA faces substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims and A&E matters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered by reserves that CNA has established. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify and may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts that include punitive or treble damages.  Lorillard. As discussed in more detail above, Lorillard is a defendant in a large number of tobacco-related cases and other litigation, in some instances seeking damages from Lorillard ranging into the billions of dollars. We are a defendant in certain of these cases as well.  We and our subsidiaries are each dependent on a small number of key executives and other key personnel to operate our businesses successfully.  Our success and the success of our operating subsidiaries substantially depends upon each company’s ability to attract and retain high quality executives and other qualified employees. In many instances, there may be only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we and our subsidiaries compete and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the successful implementation of our and our subsidiaries’ business strategies. For example, Lorillard is currently experiencing difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified personnel in some areas of its business, due primarily to the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry. In addition, Diamond Offshore and HighMount have experienced and continue to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages and increased competition for skilled workers as a result of the strengthening offshore drilling and oil and gas markets. Diamond Offshore has also sustained the loss of experienced personnel to competitors and customers. In response to these market conditions, Diamond Offshore and HighMount have implemented retention programs, including increases in compensation.       63          Item 1A. Risk Factors    Certain of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.  Certain of our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and/or financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws or. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent in recent years, and may in some cases impose “strict liability,” rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. These laws and regulations may expose us and our subsidiaries to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. For example:          ·   as discussed in more detail above, many of CNA’s policyholders have made claims for defense costs and indemnification in connection with environmental pollution matters;              ·   as an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable U.S. waters and some offshore areas, Diamond Offshore may be liable for, among other things, damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to those operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed;              ·   the risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in natural gas transportation, gathering and storage, including with respect to, among other things, the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, compliance with clean air standards and the abandonment and reclamation of Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, sites and other properties; and              ·   development, production and sale of natural gas and NGLs in the United States are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those related to discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection, permits for drilling operations, bonds for ownership, development and production of oil and gas properties and reports concerning operations, which could result in liabilities for personal injuries, property damage, spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages, suspension or termination of HighMount’s operations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties.
