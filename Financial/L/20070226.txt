Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.  Our business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries.   Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, financial condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries. In addition, the risks and uncertainties described below relating to our Carolina Group stock and our Lorillard subsidiary could lead to a material loss in the value of the Carolina Group stock.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, are public companies and file reports with the SEC. You are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities.   We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our cash flow from our subsidiaries.   We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders.  In prior years, we have restated our financial results and identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.  In May of 2005, we restated our financial results for prior years to correct CNA’s accounting for several reinsurance contracts, primarily with a former affiliate, and to correct CNA’s equity accounting for that affiliate. In February of 2006, we restated our financial results for prior years to correct the accounting for discontinued operations acquired by CNA in its merger with The Continental Corporation in 1995. In addition, in March of 2006, we restated our financial results for prior years to correct classification errors within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  As a result of the foregoing restatements, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. We also determined that our internal control over financial reporting as of such dates was not effective. Our system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management, Audit Committee and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of our published financial statements. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the implementing rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission,          25                 Item 1A. Risk Factors            the periodic reports we file with the SEC include information on our system of disclosure controls and procedures, as well as our overall internal control over financial reporting.   While we have remediated the referenced material weaknesses, if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we could be scrutinized by regulators in a manner that extends beyond the SEC’s requests for information relating to the restatements (as further described in the CNA risk factor titled CNA is responding to subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to insurance brokers and agents, contingent commissions and bidding practices, and certain finite-risk insurance products below). We could also be scrutinized by securities analysts and investors. As a result of this scrutiny, we could suffer a loss of public confidence in our financial reporting capabilities and thereby face adverse effects on our business and the market price of our securities.   Risks Related to an Investment in Our Carolina Group Stock  We cannot be certain that we will continue to pay dividends on our Carolina Group stock.   Determinations as to the future dividends on Carolina Group stock primarily will depend on the dividends paid to us by our subsidiaries, our capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant. The amount of dividends that legally could be paid on Carolina Group stock if the Carolina Group were a separate Delaware corporation may be greater than the amount actually available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law and our charter. Furthermore, our ability to pay dividends on Carolina Group stock may be reduced by dividends that we pay on our common stock.   Our board of directors reserves the right to declare and pay dividends on Carolina Group stock, and could, in its sole discretion, declare and pay dividends, or refrain from declaring and paying dividends, on Carolina Group stock. Our board of directors may take such actions regardless of the amounts available for the payment of dividends on Carolina Group stock, the amount of prior dividends declared on Carolina Group stock, the voting or liquidation rights of Carolina Group stock, or any other factor.   The independence of the board of directors of Lorillard, Inc. and the board of directors of its wholly owned subsidiary, Lorillard Tobacco Company, may affect Lorillard’s payment of dividends to us and thereby inhibit our ability or willingness to pay dividends and make other distributions on our Carolina Group stock.   Our ability and willingness to pay dividends and make other distributions on Carolina Group stock, including dividends and distributions following a disposition of substantially all of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, will depend on a number of factors, including whether the independent board of directors of Lorillard Tobacco Company causes Lorillard Tobacco Company to declare and pay dividends to its parent, Lorillard, Inc. and whether, in turn, the independent board of directors of Lorillard, Inc. causes Lorillard, Inc. to declare and pay dividends to us. In the event that Lorillard Tobacco Company or Lorillard, Inc. does not distribute its earnings, we are unlikely to pay dividends on Carolina Group stock. To the extent Lorillard, Inc. does not distribute net proceeds following the sale of substantially all of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, we will not be required to apply the net proceeds to pay dividends to holders of Carolina Group stock or redeem shares of Carolina Group stock.  We expect that the boards of directors of each of Lorillard, Inc. and Lorillard Tobacco Company will continue to function independently of us and will direct the operations and management of the assets and businesses of those corporations, respectively. None of the individuals currently serving as directors of Lorillard, Inc. or Lorillard Tobacco Company are officers, directors or employees of Loews Corporation. Notwithstanding our right, as sole shareholder, to elect and remove directors of Lorillard, Inc., we have no present intention to remove any person currently serving as a director of Lorillard, Inc. Moreover, we expect that in the event of any future vacancies on the board of directors of Lorillard, Inc., we will nominate individuals who are not officers, directors or employees of Loews Corporation to fill such vacancies.   We have allocated to the Carolina Group any liabilities or expenses that we incur as a result of tobacco-related litigation.   The Carolina Group has been allocated any and all liabilities, costs and expenses of us and Lorillard, Inc. and the subsidiaries and predecessors of Lorillard, Inc., arising out of or related to tobacco or otherwise arising out of the past,          26                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             present or future business of Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors, or claims arising out of or related to the sale of any businesses previously sold by Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries or predecessors, in each case, whether grounded in tort, contract, statute or otherwise, whether pending or asserted in the future.    Accordingly, we and/or Lorillard may make decisions with respect to litigation and settlement strategies designed to obtain our dismissal or release from tobacco-related litigation or liabilities. Such decisions and strategies could result, for example, in limitations on payment of dividends by Lorillard to us or an increase in Lorillard’s exposure in such litigation.  The Engle Agreement may affect Lorillard’s payment of dividends to us and thereby inhibit our ability or willingness to pay dividends on our Carolina Group stock.   Under the Engle Agreement if Lorillard, Inc. does not maintain a balance sheet net worth of at least $921.2 million, the stay pursuant to the agreement would terminate. Because dividends from Lorillard, Inc. to us are deducted from the balance sheet net worth of Lorillard, Inc., the Engle Agreement may affect the payment of dividends by Lorillard, Inc. to us. For a description of the Engle Agreement, please read MD&A under Item 7 and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.   Holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock are shareholders of one company and, therefore, financial impacts on one group could affect the other group.   Holders of our common stock and holders of Carolina Group stock are all common shareholders of Loews Corporation and are subject to risks associated with an investment in a single company. Financial effects arising from one group that affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition could, if significant, affect the market price of the class of common shares relating to the other group. In addition, if we or any of our subsidiaries were to incur significant indebtedness on behalf of one group, including indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with an acquisition or investment, it could affect the credit rating of us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole. This, in turn, could increase our borrowing costs. Net losses of either group and dividends or distributions on shares of any class of common or preferred stock will reduce the funds legally available for payment of future dividends on Carolina Group stock.   The complex nature of the terms of our Carolina Group stock, or confusion in the marketplace about what a tracking stock is, could materially adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock.   Tracking stocks like Carolina Group stock are more complex than traditional common stock and are not directly or entirely comparable to common stock of stand-alone companies or companies that have been spun off by their parent companies. The complex nature of the terms of Carolina Group stock, and the potential difficulties investors may have in understanding these terms, may materially adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock. Examples of these terms include:           ·   the discretion of our board of directors to make determinations that may affect Carolina Group stock and our common stock differently;               ·   our redemption and/or exchange rights under particular circumstances; and             ·   the disparate voting rights of Carolina Group stock and our common stock.         Confusion in the marketplace about what a tracking stock is and what it is intended to represent, and/or investors’ reluctance to invest in tracking stocks, could materially adversely affect the market price of Carolina Group stock.   Holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock generally vote together as a single class.   Holders of Carolina Group stock generally do not have the right to vote separately as a class. Holders of Carolina Group stock have the right to vote as a separate class only to the extent required by Delaware law. We have not held, and do not plan to hold, separate meetings for holders of Carolina Group stock.       27                Item 1A. Risk Factors           Holders of our common stock will have significantly greater voting power than holders of our Carolina Group stock with respect to any matter as to which all of our common shares vote together as one class.   Each share of our common stock has one vote. Each share of Carolina Group stock is entitled to 3/10 of a vote, which is disproportionately less than the economic interest represented by each share of Carolina Group stock. When a vote is taken on any matter as to which all of our common shares are voting together as one class, holders of our common stock will have significantly greater voting power than holders of Carolina Group stock. As of February 9, 2007, holders of our common stock controlled approximately 94.4% of our combined voting power and holders of Carolina Group stock controlled approximately 5.6% of our combined voting power. The voting power of Carolina Group stock is subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and combinations with respect to either class of stock.  Holders of our Carolina Group stock may have interests different from holders of our common stock.   The existence of separate classes of our common stock could give rise to occasions when the interests of the holders of our common stock and Carolina Group stock diverge or conflict or appear to diverge or conflict. Subject to its fiduciary duties, our board of directors could, in its sole discretion, from time to time, make determinations or implement policies that disproportionately affect the groups or the different classes of stock. Our board of directors is not required to select the option that would result in the highest value for the holders of Carolina Group stock. Examples include determinations by our board of directors to:         ·   pay or omit the payment of dividends on our common stock or Carolina Group stock;            ·   redeem shares of Carolina Group stock;            ·   approve dispositions of our assets attributed to either group;            ·   reallocate funds or assets between groups and determine the amount and type of consideration paid therefore;            ·   allocate business opportunities, resources and personnel;             ·   allocate the proceeds of issuances of Carolina Group stock either to the Loews Group, with a corresponding reduction in the intergroup interest, if and to the extent there is an intergroup interest, or to the combined attributed net assets of the Carolina Group;            ·   formulate public policy positions for us;            ·   establish relationships between the groups;            ·   make financial decisions with respect to one group that could be considered to be detrimental to the other group; and            ·   settle or otherwise seek to resolve actual or potential litigation against us in ways that might adversely affect Lorillard.         Any such decisions by our board of directors could have or be perceived to have a negative effect on the Carolina Group and could have a negative effect on the market price of Carolina Group stock.   If our Carolina Group stock is not treated as a class of our common stock, several adverse federal income tax consequences will result.   It is possible that the issuance of Carolina Group stock could be characterized as property other than our stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such characterization could require us to recognize taxable gain with respect to the issuance of Carolina Group stock and the Carolina Group would be responsible for any tax liability attributable thereto. In addition, we would likely no longer be able to file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with the Carolina Group. These tax liabilities, if they arise, would likely have a material adverse effect on us and the Carolina Group.       28                Item 1A. Risk Factors           Changes in the tax law or in the interpretation of current tax law may result in redemption of the Carolina Group stock or cessation of the issuance of shares of Carolina Group stock.   If there are adverse tax consequences to us or the Carolina Group resulting from the issuance of Carolina Group stock, it is possible that we would not issue shares of Carolina Group stock even if we would otherwise choose to do so. This possibility could affect the value of Carolina Group stock then outstanding. Furthermore, we are entitled to redeem Carolina Group stock for either (1) cash in an amount equal to 105% of the average market price per share of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common stock having a value equal to 100% of the ratio of the average market price per share of Carolina Group stock to the average market price per share of our common stock, if, based upon the opinion of tax counsel, there are adverse federal income tax law developments related to Carolina Group stock. In each case, the average market price would be determined over a specified 20 trading day period.   Our board of directors may, at any time until the 90th day after the disposition of 80% of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, redeem shares of our Carolina Group stock.   Our board of directors may, at any time until the 90th day after the disposition of 80% of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, redeem all outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for either (1) cash in an amount equal to 120% of the average market price per share of Carolina Group stock or (2) our common stock having a value equal to 115% of the ratio of the average market price per share of Carolina Group stock to the average market price per share of our common stock. In each case, the average market price would be determined over a specific 20 trading day period. A decision to redeem the Carolina Group stock could be made at a time when either or both of our common stock and Carolina Group stock may be considered to be overvalued or undervalued. In addition, a redemption would preclude holders of Carolina Group stock from retaining their investment in a security intended to reflect separately the economic performance of the Carolina Group. It would also give holders of shares of converted Carolina Group stock an amount of consideration that may be less than the amount of consideration a third-party buyer pays or would pay for all or substantially all of the net assets attributed to the Carolina Group.   If we choose to redeem our Carolina Group stock for cash, holders of Carolina Group stock may have taxable gain or taxable income.   We may, under certain circumstances, redeem Carolina Group stock for cash. If we choose to do so, holders of Carolina Group stock would generally be subject to tax on the excess, if any, of the total consideration they receive for their Carolina Group stock over their adjusted basis in their Carolina Group stock.   Our board of directors does not owe a separate duty to holders of Carolina Group stock.   Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of two classes of capital stock or two groups of holders of the same class of capital stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all shareholders regardless of class or series, and does not have separate or additional duties to either group of shareholders. Thus, holders of Carolina Group stock who believe that a determination by our board of directors has a disparate impact on their class of stock may not be able to obtain a remedy for such a claim.   Our board of directors may change the Carolina Group policy statement without shareholder approval.   In connection with the initial issuance of Carolina Group stock, our board of directors adopted the Carolina Group policy statement to govern the relationship between the Loews Group and the Carolina Group. Our board of directors may modify, suspend or rescind the policies set forth in the Carolina Group policy statement or make additions or exceptions to them, in the sole discretion of our board of directors, without approval of our shareholders. Our board of directors may also adopt additional policies, depending upon the circumstances. Any changes to our policies could have a negative effect on the holders of Carolina Group stock.   Our directors’ and officers’ disproportionate ownership of our common stock compared to our Carolina Group stock may give rise to conflicts of interest.   Our directors and officers own shares of our common stock and have been awarded stock options with respect to shares of our common stock. As of February 9, 2007 our directors and executive officers beneficially owned          29                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             approximately 38.2 million shares of our common stock and no shares of Carolina Group stock, which represents approximately 6.6% of our combined voting power. Accordingly, our directors and officers could have an economic incentive to favor the Loews Group over the Carolina Group.   Because it is possible for an acquiror to obtain control of us by purchasing shares of our common stock without purchasing any shares of our Carolina Group stock, holders of Carolina Group stock may not share in any takeover premium.   Because holders of our common stock have significantly greater voting power than holders of Carolina Group stock, a potential acquiror could acquire control of us by acquiring shares of our common stock without purchasing any shares of Carolina Group stock. As a result, holders of Carolina Group stock might not share in any takeover premium and Carolina Group stock may have a lower market price than it would have if there were a greater likelihood that holders of Carolina Group stock would share in any takeover premium.  Holders of our Carolina Group stock may receive less consideration upon a sale of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group than if the Carolina Group were a separate company.   Assuming the assets attributed to the Carolina Group represent less than substantially all of our assets as a whole, our board of directors could, in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval, approve sales and other dispositions of any amount of our assets attributed to the Carolina Group because the Delaware General Corporation Law requires shareholder approval only for a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the entire company. Similarly, the boards of directors of Lorillard, Inc. or its subsidiaries could decide to sell or otherwise dispose of the operating and other assets reflected in the financial statements of the Carolina Group without the approval of holders of Carolina Group stock.   If 80% or more of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group are sold, we may take one of the following actions, and if we receive any net proceeds from the sale and determine not to retain all of such proceeds as tobacco contingency reserves, we must take one of the following actions:        ·   pay a special dividend to holders of Carolina Group stock in an amount equal to their pro rata share of the net proceeds (subject to reduction for repayment of notional debt, amounts not distributed from Lorillard to us and the creation by us of reserves for tobacco-related contingent liabilities and future costs) from the disposition in the form of cash and/or securities (other than our common stock);            ·   redeem shares of Carolina Group stock for cash and/or securities (other than our common stock) in an amount equal to the pro rata share of the net proceeds (subject to reduction for repayment of notional debt) from the disposition of all of the assets attributable to the Carolina Group;            ·   redeem shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of our common stock at a 15% premium based on the respective market values of Carolina Group stock and our common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the 5th trading day prior to announcement of the sale; or             ·   take some combination of the actions described above.        Our board of directors has the discretion to choose from the foregoing options. The value of the consideration paid to holders of Carolina Group stock in the different scenarios described above could be significantly different. Our board of directors would not be required to select the option that would result in the distribution with the highest value to the holders of Carolina Group stock.   If, on the 91st day following the sale of 80% or more of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group, we have not redeemed all of the outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock and Lorillard subsequently distributes to us any previously undistributed portion of the net proceeds and/or we subsequently release any amount of net proceeds previously retained by us as a reserve for tobacco-related contingent liabilities or future costs, we will distribute the pro rata share of such amounts to holders of Carolina Group stock. At any time after:        ·   Lorillard has distributed to us all previously undistributed portions of the net proceeds;             30                 Item 1A. Risk Factors                 ·   no amounts remain in reserve in respect of tobacco-related contingent liabilities and future costs; and             ·   the only asset remaining in the Carolina Group is cash and/or cash equivalents,      then we may redeem all of the outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for cash in an amount equal to the greater of (1) the pro rata share of the remaining assets of the Carolina Group and (2) $0.001 per share of Carolina Group stock.  If the Carolina Group were a separate, independent company and its shares were acquired by another person, some of the costs of that sale, including corporate level taxes, might not be payable in connection with that acquisition. As a result, shareholders of a separate, independent company might receive an amount greater than the net proceeds that would be received by the holders of Carolina Group stock. In addition, we cannot assure that the net proceeds per share of Carolina Group stock received by its holder in connection with any redemption following a sale of Carolina Group assets will be equal to or greater than the market value per share of Carolina Group stock prior to or after announcement of a sale of assets reflected in the Carolina Group. Nor can we assure that, where consideration is based on the market value of Carolina Group stock, the market value will be equal to or greater than the net proceeds per share of Carolina Group stock.   We may cause a mandatory exchange of our Carolina Group stock.   We may exchange all outstanding shares of Carolina Group stock for shares of one or more of our qualifying subsidiaries. Such an exchange would result in the qualifying subsidiary or subsidiaries becoming a separate public company and the holders of Carolina Group stock owning shares directly in that subsidiary or those subsidiaries. If we choose to exchange shares of Carolina Group stock in this manner, the market value of the common stock received in that exchange could be less than the market value of Carolina Group stock exchanged.   If we are liquidated, amounts distributed to holders of our Carolina Group stock may not reflect the value of the assets attributed to the Carolina Group.   In the event we are liquidated, we would determine the liquidation rights of the holders of Carolina Group stock in accordance with the market capitalization of the outstanding shares of the Loews Group and the Carolina Group at a specified time prior to the time of liquidation. However, the relative market capitalization of the outstanding shares of each group may not correctly reflect the value of the net assets remaining and attributed to the groups after satisfaction of outstanding liabilities. Accordingly, the holders of Carolina Group stock could receive less consideration upon liquidation than they would if the groups were separate entities.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation  If CNA determines that loss reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims, CNA may need to increase its loss reserves.  CNA maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reserves represent CNA management’s best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by CNA, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling and case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant management judgment. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, CNA is sometimes required to add to our reserves. This is called unfavorable development and results in a charge to our earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial and can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity. Please read additional information on CNA’s reserves included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.         31                 Item 1A. Risk Factors           CNA is subject to uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves which can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:        ·   increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical products;            ·   the effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other major corporate governance failures, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims, including director and officer and errors and omissions insurance claims;            ·   class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices;            ·   construction defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional insured endorsements on policies;             ·   clergy abuse claims, including passage of legislation to reopen or extend various statutes of limitations; and            ·   mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to silica, welding rods, benzene, lead and various other chemical exposure claims.      In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. In addition, CNA periodically undergoes state regulatory financial examinations, including review and analysis of its reserves. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against CNA’s earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges can be substantial and can materially adversely affect our results of operations and equity.  Loss reserves for asbestos, environmental pollution and mass torts are especially difficult to estimate and may result in more frequent and larger additions to these reserves.  CNA’s experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to APMT claim and claim adjustment expenses is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort claims is subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of additional factors, including among others:        ·   coverage issues, including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits apply;            ·   inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories;            ·   increasingly aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’ lawyers;            ·   the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;            ·   changes in the volume of asbestos, environmental pollution and mass tort claims which cannot now be anticipated;            ·   continued increases in mass tort claims relating to silica and silica-containing products;            ·   the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on any umbrella or excess policies CNA has issued;            ·   the number and outcome of direct actions against CNA;           32                 Item 1A. Risk Factors                 ·   CNA’s ability to recover reinsurance for these claims; and            ·   changes in the legal and legislative environment in which CNA operates.      As a result of this higher degree of variability, CNA has necessarily supplemented traditional actuarial methods and techniques with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many of which involve significant judgment on the part of management. Consequently, CNA may periodically need to record changes in its claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future in these areas in amounts that may be material. The sections below provide more details involving the specific factors affecting CNA’s estimation of reserves for casualty coverages relating to environmental pollution and asbestos. Please read information on APMT included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  Environmental pollution claims. The estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claims is complicated by the assertion by many policyholders of claims for defense costs and indemnification. CNA and others in the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims. Key coverage issues in these claims include:        ·   whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and accordingly whether CNA would be liable for these costs);            ·   the trigger of coverage, and the allocation of liability among triggered policies;            ·   the applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions;            ·   the potential for joint and several liability; and            ·   the definition of an occurrence.      To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding to the uncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.  Further, the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability and insurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensive litigation. In many cases, courts have expanded the scope of coverage and liability for cleanup costs beyond the original intent of CNA’s insurance policies. In addition, the standards for cleanup in environmental pollution matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject to cleanup under applicable laws is unknown and the impact of various proposals to reform existing statutes and regulations is difficult to predict.   Asbestos claims. The estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult for many of the same reasons discussed above for environmental pollution claims, as well as:        ·   inconsistency of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court decisions;            ·   specific policy provisions;            ·   allocation of liability among insurers and insureds;            ·   missing policies and proof of coverage;            ·   the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties;            ·   novel theories asserted by policyholders and their legal counsel;            ·   the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants;            33                 Item 1A. Risk Factors                 ·   uncertainties in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds may be targeted in the future;            ·   volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands;            ·   increases in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims;            ·   the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to aggregate limits;            ·   the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation, as well as the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims;            ·   medical inflation trends;            ·   the mix of asbestos-related diseases presented; and            ·   the ability to recover reinsurance.       In addition, a number of CNA’s insureds have asserted that their claims against CNA for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. If these insureds are successful in this regard, CNA’s potential liability for their claims would be unlimited. Some of these insureds contend that their asbestos claims fall within the so-called “non-products” liability coverage within their policies, rather than the products liability coverage, and that this “non-products” liability coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the extent to which these claims will succeed and, as a result, the ultimate size of these claims.  Catastrophe losses are unpredictable.  Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, severe winter weather and fires, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, and snow. For example, in 2005, CNA experienced substantial losses from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and in 2004, CNA experienced substantial losses from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne. The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves. In addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to CNA to be finally determined. As its claim experience develops on a particular catastrophe, CNA may be required to adjust reserves, or take additional unfavorable development, to reflect its revised estimates of the total cost of claims. CNA believes that it could incur significant catastrophe losses in the future. Please read information on catastrophe losses included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA’s key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings could vary significantly.  CNA’s reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remaining in force, interest rates, and/or future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the deferred acquisition costs may not be fully recovered and the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development.        34                 Item 1A. Risk Factors           High levels of retained overhead expenses associated with business lines in run-off negatively impact CNA’s operating results.  During the past few years, CNA ceased offering certain insurance products relating principally to its life, group and reinsurance segments. Many of these business lines were sold, others have been placed in run-off and, as a result, revenue will progressively decrease. CNA’s results of operations have been materially, adversely affected by the high levels of retained overhead expenses associated with these run-off operations, and will continue to be so affected if CNA is not successful in eliminating or reducing these costs.  CNA’s premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.  CNA purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of CNA’s business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost CNA deems acceptable, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of CNA’s underwriting commitments. Please read information on Reinsurance included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers.  CNA has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in the balance sheets and estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to it. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due to it from reinsurers, its claims expenses will be higher. Please read information on reinsurance included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings for CNA in the future, and thereby adversely affect CNA’s ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.  Ratings are an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as its public debt, are rated by four major rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc. Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debtholders. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.  Due to the intense competitive environment in which CNA operates, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for CNA to take material unfavorable development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to further lower CNA’s ratings in the future. If CNA’s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings were downgraded below current levels, its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on our business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of our insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.  In addition, CNA believes that a lowering of our debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s circumstances. CNA has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally          35                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             more than one level below CNA’s current ratings. Please read information on our ratings included in the MD&A under Item 7.   CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it does not meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.  Insurance companies such as CNA are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of CNA’s statutory capital and surplus reported in CNA’s statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the risk-based capital formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, state regulators may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business. If CNA is required to record a charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital. Examples of events leading CNA to record a charge against earnings include impairment of its investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience.  CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.  CNA Financial Corporation is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Dividend payments, however, must be approved by the subsidiaries’ domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment. Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year’s earned surplus. If CNA is restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, CNA may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital, which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.   CNA is responding to subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries relating to insurance brokers and agents, contingent commissions and bidding practices, and certain finite-risk insurance products.  Along with other companies in the industry, CNA has received subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries from: (i) California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, West Virginia and the Canadian Council of Insurance Regulators concerning investigations into practices including contingent compensation arrangements, fictitious quotes, and tying arrangements; (ii) the SEC, the New York State Attorney General, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the Connecticut Attorney General, the Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Delaware Department of Insurance, the Georgia Office of Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner and the California Department of Insurance concerning reinsurance products and finite insurance products purchased and sold by CNA; (iii) the Massachusetts Attorney General and the Connecticut Attorney General concerning investigations into anti-competitive practices; and (iv) the New York State Attorney General concerning declinations of attorney malpractice insurance. CNA continues to respond to these subpoenas, interrogatories and inquiries to the extent they are still open.  Subsequent to receipt of the SEC subpoena, CNA produced documents and provided additional information at the SEC’s request. In addition, the SEC and representatives of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York conducted interviews with several of CNA’s current and former executives relating to the restatement of its financial results for 2004, including CNA’s relationship with and accounting for transactions with an affiliate that were the basis for the restatement. The SEC also requested information relating to our restatement in 2006 of prior period results. It is possible that CNA’s analyses of, or accounting treatment for, finite reinsurance contracts or discontinued operations could be questioned or disputed by regulatory authorities. As a result, further restatements of CNA’s financial results are possible.       36                Item 1A. Risk Factors           CNA’s investment portfolio, which is a key component of its overall profitability, may suffer reduced returns or losses, especially with respect to its equity in various limited partnership net assets which are often subject to greater leverage and volatility.  Investment returns are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability. General economic conditions, stock market conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, and many other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the returns and the overall value of its equity investments and its ability to control the timing of the realization of investment income. In addition, any defaults in the payments due to CNA for its investments, especially with respect to liquid corporate and municipal bonds, could reduce CNA’s investment income and realized investment gains or could cause CNA to incur investment losses. Further, CNA invests a portion of its assets in equity investments, primarily through limited partnerships, which are subject to greater volatility than its fixed income investments. In some cases, these limited partnerships use leverage and are thereby subject to even greater volatility. Although limited partnership investments generally provide higher expected return, they present greater risk and are more illiquid than CNA’s fixed income investments. As a result of these factors, CNA may not realize an adequate return on its investments, may incur losses on sales of its investments and may be required to write down the value of its investments.  CNA may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.  The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates.   Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Lorillard, Inc.  Lorillard is a defendant in approximately 2,840 tobacco-related lawsuits, which are extremely costly to defend, and which could result in substantial judgments against Lorillard.   Numerous legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes are pending against Lorillard, and it is likely that similar claims will continue to be filed for the foreseeable future. Settlements and victories by plaintiffs in highly publicized cases against Lorillard and other tobacco companies, together with acknowledgments by Lorillard and other tobacco companies regarding the health effects of smoking, may stimulate further claims. In addition, adverse outcomes in pending cases could have adverse effects on the ability of Lorillard to prevail in smoking and health litigation.   Approximately 2,840 tobacco-related cases are pending against Lorillard in the United States. Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars, are specifically pleaded in a number of cases in addition to compensatory and other damages. It is possible that the outcome of these cases, individually or in the aggregate, could result in bankruptcy. It is also possible that Lorillard may be unable to post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution of a judgment in jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on the merits of the case. Even if Lorillard is successful in defending some or all of these actions, these types of cases are very expensive to defend. A material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs.  Further, adverse decisions in actions against tobacco companies other than Lorillard could have an adverse impact on the industry, including Lorillard. For example, in 2006 the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed the verdict in Williams v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., in which plaintiff was awarded approximately $525,000 in compensatory damages and $79.5 million in punitive damages, a ratio of more than 150:1. The Oregon Supreme Court had determined that the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was not inconsistent with U.S. Supreme Court precedents in this area. In February of 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated that decision on other grounds and returned Williams to the Oregon Supreme Court for further consideration. Lorillard is not a party to Williams. Please read information included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.  A substantial judgment has been rendered against Lorillard in the Scott litigation.   In June of 2004, the court entered a final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in Scott v. The American Tobacco Company, et al. (District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, filed May 24, 1996), a class action on behalf of certain cigarette smokers resident in the State of Louisiana. The jury awarded plaintiffs approximately $591.0 million to fund          37                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             cessation programs for Louisiana smokers. The court’s final judgment also reflected its award of prejudgment interest. During February of 2007, the Louisiana Court of Appeal issued a ruling that, among other things, reduced the amount of the award by approximately $312.0 million; struck the award of prejudgment interest, which totaled approximately $440.0 million as of December 31, 2006; and ruled that the only class members who are eligible to participate in the smoking cessation program are those who began smoking by September 1, 1988, and whose claims accrued by September 1, 1988. The Louisiana Court of Appeal has returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. Lorillard’s share of any judgment has not been determined. It is possible that the parties will seek further review of this decision. For additional information on the Scott case, please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.   The verdict returned in the federal government’s reimbursement case, while not final, could impose significant financial burdens on Lorillard and adversely affect future sales and profits.  During August of 2006, a final judgment and remedial order was entered in United States of America v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al. (U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, filed September 22, 1999). Lorillard is one of the defendants in the case. Although the verdict did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff, the final judgment and remedial order granted equitable relief and imposes a number of requirements on the defendants. Such requirements include, but are not limited to, corrective statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking. The remedial order also would place certain prohibitions on the manner in which defendants market their cigarette products and would eliminate any use of “lights” or similar product descriptors. It is likely that the remedial order, including the prohibitions on the use of the descriptors relating to low tar cigarettes, will negatively affect Lorillard’s future sales and profits. Defendants, including Lorillard, have noticed appeals from the final judgment and the remedial order. Plaintiff also has noticed an appeal from the final judgment. Defendants have received a stay of the judgment and remedial order from the District of Columbia Court of Appeal that will remain in effect while the appeal is proceeding. As a result of the government’s appeal, it is possible that certain of the government’s claims or damages could be reinstated. While trial was underway, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that plaintiff may not seek disgorgement of profits, but this appeal was interlocutory in nature and could be reconsidered in the present appeal. Prior to trial, the government had estimated that it was entitled to approximately $280.0 billion from the defendants for its disgorgement of profits claim. In addition, the government sought during trial more than $10.0 billion for the creation of nationwide smoking cessation, public education and counter-marketing programs. In its 2006 verdict, the trial court declined to award such relief. It is possible that these claims could be reinstated on appeal. Please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation.  Lorillard is a defendant in a case that has been certified as a nationwide class action and that could result in a substantial verdict.  Schwab v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., et al. (U.S. District Court, Eastern District, New York, filed May 11, 2004), has been certified by a federal judge as a nationwide class action on behalf of individuals who purchased “lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs’ claims in Schwab are based on defendants’ alleged RICO violations in the manufacture, marketing and sale of “lights” cigarettes. Plaintiffs have estimated damages to the class to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Any damages awarded to the plaintiffs based on defendants’ violation of the RICO statute would be trebled. The federal court of appeals has agreed to review the class certification order, and it has stayed all activity before the trial court until the appeal is concluded. Please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation.  The Florida Supreme Court’s approval of an order vacating a $16.3 billion judgment against Lorillard in the Engle litigation is not final.  Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., et al. (Circuit Court, Dade County, Florida, filed May 5, 1994) was certified as a class action on behalf of Florida residents, and survivors of Florida residents, who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction to cigarettes. During 2000, a jury awarded the certified class approximately $16.3 billion in punitive damages against Lorillard. This award was part of a verdict against other major tobacco companies that totaled $145.0 billion in punitive damages. The verdict bears interest at the rate of 10.0% per year. During 2006, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the 2003 holding of an intermediate appellate court that the $145.0 billion punitive damages award must be vacated. The Florida Supreme Court also determined that the case could not          38                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             proceed further as a class action and decertified the class. The Florida Supreme Court has formally concluded its consideration of Engle, but the time for plaintiffs to seek review of the case by the U.S. Supreme Court has not expired.   In the event that the circuit court’s $16.3 billion punitive damages judgment against Lorillard is reinstated and ultimately upheld, the amount of that judgment would significantly exceed the assets of Lorillard. Even if the circuit court’s $16.3 billion punitive damages judgment were reduced, the reduced amount of the final judgment might ultimately exceed the assets of Lorillard and result in a liquidation or bankruptcy of Lorillard. For additional information on the Engle case, please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.  The Florida Supreme Court’s ruling in Engle could encourage additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard.  The 2006 ruling by the Florida Supreme Court in Engle permits members of the decertified class to file individual claims, including claims for punitive damages. The opportunity for filing such cases concludes during January of 2008. The Florida Supreme Court held that these individual plaintiffs are entitled to rely on some of the jury’s findings in favor of the plaintiffs in the first phase of the Engle trial on a number of issues including, among other things, that smoking cigarettes causes a number of diseases; that cigarettes are addictive or dependence-producing; and that the defendants, including Lorillard, were negligent, breached express and implied warranties, placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous, and concealed or conspired to conceal the risks of smoking. The Supreme Court further held that these first phase jury findings will be binding on the Engle defendants, including Lorillard, in any such future case filed by a member of the former class. It is possible that a significant number of additional individual lawsuits will be filed against cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard, by former class members. It is not possible to estimate the number or ultimate outcome of lawsuits that could be filed as a result of this decision. In the aggregate, these claims may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional information on the Engle case, please read Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.  The United States Surgeon General has issued a report regarding the risks of cigarette smoking to non-smokers that could result in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, additional restrictions placed on the use of cigarettes, and additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes.  In a report entitled “The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General, 2006,” the United States Surgeon General summarized conclusions from previous Surgeon General’s reports concerning the health effects of exposure to second-hand smoke by non-smokers. According to this report, scientific evidence now supports six major conclusions:         ·   Second-hand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke.            ·   Children exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory infections and ear problems.            ·   Exposure of adults to second-hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes heart disease and lung cancer.            ·   The scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to second-hand smoke.            ·   Many millions of Americans, both children and adults, are exposed to second-hand smoke in their homes and workplaces.            ·   Eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects non-smokers from exposure to second-hand smoke. Separating smokers from non-smokers, cleaning the air, and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of non-smokers to second-hand smoke.      This report could form the basis of additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard. The report could be used to support existing litigation against Lorillard or other cigarette manufacturers. It also is possible that the          39                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             Surgeon General’s report could result in additional restrictions placed on cigarette smoking or in additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes. It is possible that such additional restrictions or regulations could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States, including sales of Lorillard brands. These developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.   Lorillard has substantial payment obligations under litigation settlement agreements which will materially adversely affect its cash flows and operating income in future periods.   Lorillard and other manufacturers of tobacco products are parties to the State Settlement Agreements with the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories, which settled the asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and certain other claims of those states and territories.  Under the State Settlement Agreements, Lorillard is obligated to pay approximately $925.0 million to $975.0 million in 2007, primarily based on 2006 estimated industry volume. Annual payments under the State Settlement Agreements are required to be paid in perpetuity and are based, among other things, on Lorillard’s domestic market share and unit volume of domestic shipments in the year preceding the year in which payment is due. Please read Note 20 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 for additional information regarding the State Settlement Agreements.  Concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely affect Lorillard.   Some plaintiffs and other sources, including among others, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, have claimed that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks than non-mentholated cigarettes. If such claims were to be substantiated, Lorillard, as the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes in the United States, could face increased exposure to tobacco-related litigation. Even if those claims are not substantiated, increased concerns about the health impact of mentholated cigarettes could adversely affect Lorillard’s sales, including sales of Newport.   Lorillard is subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes that could harm its competitive position.   Television and radio advertisements of tobacco products have been prohibited since 1971. Under the State Settlement Agreements, Lorillard generally cannot use billboard advertising, cartoon characters, sponsorship of concerts, non-tobacco merchandise bearing its brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques. In addition, the Master Settlement Agreement prohibits the targeting of youth in advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products. Accordingly, Lorillard has determined not to advertise its cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of 18. Additional restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future. These limitations may make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if sales or market share decline for any reason. Moreover, these limitations significantly impair the ability of cigarette manufacturers, including Lorillard, to launch new premium brands.   Sales of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal, state and local excise taxes.   In 1999, federal excise taxes were $0.24 per pack and state excise taxes ranged from $0.03 to $1.00 per pack. In 2006, the federal excise tax was $0.39 per pack and combined state and local excise taxes ranged from $0.07 to $3.66 per pack. During 2006, excise tax increases ranging from $0.05 to $1.00 per pack of 20 cigarettes were implemented in six states and two municipalities. Proposals continue to be made to increase federal, state and local tobacco excise taxes. Lorillard believes that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that future increases, the extent of which cannot be predicted, could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry, including Lorillard, and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands.  Lorillard is dependent on the U.S. cigarette business, which we expect to continue to contract.   Lorillard’s U.S. cigarette business is currently its only significant business. The U.S. cigarette market has generally been contracting and we expect it to continue to contract. Lorillard does not have foreign cigarette sales that could offset these effects, as it sold the international rights to substantially all of its brands, including Newport, in 1977. As a result of price increases, restrictions on advertising and promotions, increases in regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, a          40                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             decline in the social acceptability of smoking, increased pressure from anti-tobacco groups and other factors, U.S. cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound annual rate of approximately 2.6% over the period 1997 through 2006, as measured by Management Science Associates. Domestic U.S. cigarette industry shipments decreased by 2.4% during 2006, as compared to 2005, and 3.2% for 2005, as compared to 2004, according to information provided by Management Science Associates.   Lorillard derives most of its revenue from the sales of one product in the premium market.   Lorillard’s largest selling brand, Newport, accounted for approximately 93.3% of Lorillard’s sales revenue in 2006. Newport is positioned in the premium segment of the U.S. cigarette market. Lorillard’s principal strategic plan revolves around the advertising and promotion of its Newport brand. Lorillard cannot ensure that it will continue to successfully implement its strategic plan with respect to Newport or that implementation of its strategic plan will result in the maintenance or growth of the Newport brand.   The use of significant amounts of promotion expenses and sales incentives in response to competitive actions and market price sensitivity may have a material adverse impact on Lorillard.  The cigarette market over recent years has been very price competitive due to the impact of, among other things, higher state and local excise taxes and the market share of deep discount brands. In response to these and other competitor actions and pricing pressures, Lorillard has engaged in significant use of promotional expenses and sales incentives. The cost of these measures could have a material adverse impact on Lorillard. Lorillard regularly reviews the results of its promotional spending activities and adjusts its promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain its competitive position. Accordingly, unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent periods.  Several of Lorillard’s competitors have developed alternative cigarette products.   Certain of the major cigarette makers are marketing alternative cigarette products. For example, Philip Morris has developed an alternative cigarette called Accord in which the tobacco is heated rather than burned. Reynolds American has developed an alternative cigarette called Eclipse in which the tobacco is primarily heated, with only a small amount of tobacco burned. Vector Tobacco Inc. is marketing a cigarette offered in several packings with declining levels of nicotine, called Quest. Philip Morris and Reynolds American have indicated that these products may deliver fewer smoke components as compared to conventional cigarettes. Lorillard has not marketed similar alternative cigarettes. Should such alternative cigarette products gain a significant share of the U.S. cigarette market, Lorillard may be at a competitive disadvantage.   Lorillard may not be able to develop, produce or commercialize competitive new products and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer preferences.   Consumer health concerns and changes in regulations are likely to require Lorillard to introduce new products or make substantial changes to existing products. For example, six states have enacted legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to reduce the ignition propensity of their products. Lorillard believes that there may be increasing pressure from public health authorities to develop a conventional cigarette or an alternative cigarette that provides a demonstrable reduced risk of adverse health effects. Lorillard may not be able to develop a reduced risk product that is acceptable to consumers. In addition, the costs associated with developing any such new products and technologies could be substantial.   The availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect Lorillard’s sales.   Sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the United States, including counterfeits of Lorillard’s Newport brand, could adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of the brands that are counterfeited and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands. The availability of counterfeit Newport cigarettes could have a material adverse effect on Lorillard’s sales volumes, revenue and profits.       41                Item 1A. Risk Factors           Lorillard relies on a single manufacturing facility for the production of its cigarettes.   Lorillard produces all of its cigarettes at its Greensboro, North Carolina manufacturing facility. If Lorillard’s manufacturing plant is damaged, destroyed or incapacitated or Lorillard is otherwise unable to operate its manufacturing facility, Lorillard may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable to meet customer demand.   Lorillard relies on a small number of suppliers for certain of its tobacco leaf.  Lorillard purchases more than 90% of its domestic leaf tobacco from one supplier, Alliance One International, Inc. In addition, Lorillard purchases all of its reconstituted tobacco from one supplier, which is an affiliate of Reynolds American, Inc., a major competitor of Lorillard. If either of these suppliers becomes unwilling or unable to supply Lorillard and Lorillard is unable to find an alternative supplier on a timely basis, Lorillard’s operations could be disrupted resulting in lower production levels and reduced sales.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP  Boardwalk Pipeline’s expansion projects may not be completed or completed on materially different terms or timing than initially anticipated. If completed, the expansion project may not achieve the intended benefits.  Boardwalk Pipeline has announced significant proposed expansion projects and may consider additional expansion projects in the future. Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates that it will be required to seek additional financing in the future to fund current and future expansion projects and may not be able to secure such financing on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to complete the expansion projects on time as a result of weather conditions, delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals, delays in obtaining key materials, labor difficulties and land owner opposition, difficulties with partners or potential partners or other factors beyond its control. If Boardwalk Pipeline does not meet designated schedules for approval and construction of its expansion projects, certain of its customers may have the right to terminate their precedent agreements relating to the expansion projects. Certain customers may also have the right to receive liquidated damages. Even if expansion projects are completed, the total cost of the expansion projects may be higher than anticipated and the performance of Boardwalk Pipeline’s business following the expansion projects may not meet expectations. Further, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to timely and effectively integrate the expansion projects into operations, such integration may result in unforeseen operating difficulties or unanticipated costs and the expansion projects might divert the attention of management from other business concerns. Any of these or other factors could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the expansion projects and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to FERC rate-making policies.   Action by the FERC on currently pending matters as well as matters arising in the future could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to establish rates, or to charge rates that would cover future increases in Boardwalk Pipeline’s costs, or even to continue to collect rates that cover current costs. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot make assurances that it will be able to recover all of its costs through existing or future rates. An adverse determination in any future rate proceeding brought by or against Texas Gas or Gulf South could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   On July 20, 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) issued its opinion in BP West Coast Products, LLC v. FERC (“BP West Coast”) and vacated the portion of the FERC’s decision applying the FERC’s Lakehead policy to determine an allowance for income taxes in the regulated cost of service. In its Lakehead decision, the FERC allowed an oil pipeline limited partnership to include in its cost of service an income tax allowance to the extent that its unitholders were corporations subject to income tax. The D.C. Circuit emphasized that a regulated pipeline’s cost of service should include only “appropriate cost[s]” and compared income taxes paid by owners of equity interests in a pipeline to the costs of bookkeeping paid by such owners, indicating the court’s belief that such costs paid by an entity other than the regulated entity would not be recoverable in the rates of the pipeline. In May and June 2005, the FERC issued a statement of general policy and an order on remand of BP West Coast, respectively, in which the FERC stated it will permit pipelines to include in cost-of-service a tax allowance to reflect actual or potential tax liability on their public utility income attributable to all partnership or limited liability company interests, if the          42                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income. Whether a pipeline’s owners have such actual or potential income tax liability will be reviewed by the FERC on a case-by-case basis. Although the new policy is generally favorable for pipelines that are organized as pass-through entities, it still entails risk due to the case-by-case review requirement. In December 2005, the FERC issued a case-specific review of the income tax allowance issue in the SFPP, L.P. proceeding. The FERC ruled favorably to SFPP, L.P. on all income tax issues and set forth guidelines regarding the type of evidence necessary for the pipeline to determine its income tax allowance. The FERC’s BP West Coast remand decision, the new tax allowance policy, and the December 2005 order have been appealed to the D.C. Circuit. As a result, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings is not certain and could result in changes to the FERC’s treatment of income tax allowances in cost of service. If the FERC were to change its tax allowance policies in the future, or if current policy was reversed or changed on appeal by a court, such changes could materially and adversely impact the rates Boardwalk Pipeline is permitted to charge as future rates are approved for its interstate transportation services.   Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which Boardwalk Pipeline may not be adequately insured.   There are a variety of operating risks inherent in Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems, all of which could cause substantial financial losses. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations and substantial revenue losses. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from these risks.   Boardwalk Pipeline currently possesses property, business interruption and general liability insurance, but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs on commercially reasonable costs and terms.   Because of the natural decline in gas production from existing wells, Boardwalk Pipeline’s success depends on its ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas.   For the years 2003 to 2005, gas production from the Gulf Coast region, which supplies the majority of Boardwalk Pipeline’s throughput, has declined an average of approximately 11.0% per year according to the Energy Information Administration (the “EIA”). A large part of this decline was due to the effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot give any assurance regarding the gas production industry’s ability to find new sources of domestic supply. Production from existing wells and gas supply basins connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems will naturally decline further over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these wells may also be less than Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates, or the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than Boardwalk Pipeline anticipates. Accordingly, to maintain or increase throughput levels on its pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline must continually obtain access to new supplies of natural gas. The primary factors affecting Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to obtain new sources of natural gas to its pipelines include: (1) the level of successful drilling activity near Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines; (2) Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for these supplies; (3) the successful completion of new liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) facilities near Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities; and (4) Boardwalk Pipeline’s gas quality requirements.   The level of drilling activity is dependent on a number of factors beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. The primary factor that impacts drilling decisions is the price of oil and natural gas. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the fields served or to be served by Boardwalk Pipeline, which would lead to reduced throughput levels on its pipelines. Other factors that impact production decisions include producers’ capital budget limitations, the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits, the availability and cost of drilling rigs and other drilling equipment, and regulatory changes. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves were discovered in areas served by Boardwalk Pipeline, producers may choose not to develop those reserves or may connect them to different pipelines.        43                Item 1A. Risk Factors           Imported LNG is expected to be a significant component of future natural gas supply to the United States. Much of this increase in LNG supply is expected to be imported through new LNG facilities to be developed over the next decade. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot predict which, if any, of these projects will be constructed. If a significant number of these new projects fail to be developed with their announced capacity, or there are significant delays in such development, or if they are built in locations where they are not connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems or they do not influence sources of supply on its systems, Boardwalk Pipeline may not realize expected increases in future natural gas supply available for transportation through its systems.   If Boardwalk Pipeline is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing supply basins, or if the expected increase in natural gas supply through imported LNG is not realized, throughput on its pipeline systems would decline.  Successful development of LNG import terminals in the eastern or northeastern United States could reduce the demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services.   Development of new, or expansion of existing, LNG facilities on the East Coast could reduce the need for customers in the northeastern United States to transport natural gas from the Gulf Coast and other supply basins connected to the Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems. This could reduce the amount of gas transported by Boardwalk Pipeline for delivery off-system to other interstate pipelines serving the northeast. If Boardwalk Pipeline is not able to replace these volumes with volumes to other markets or other regions, throughput on its pipeline systems will decline.  Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates.   Boardwalk Pipeline’s primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time existing transportation contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation. As of December 31, 2006, approximately 14.0% of the firm contract load on the Boardwalk Pipeline systems was due to expire on or before December 31, 2007. Upon expiration, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long-term basis. A key determinant of the value that customers can realize from firm transportation on a pipeline is the basis differential, which can be affected by, among other things, the availability of supply, available capacity, storage inventories, weather and general market demand in the respective areas.  The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control, including:         ·   existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to Boardwalk Pipeline’s markets;             ·   the growth in demand for natural gas in Boardwalk Pipeline’s markets;             ·   whether the market will continue to support long-term contracts;              ·   the reduction of current basis differentials-market price spreads between two points across the Boardwalk Pipeline systems;            ·   whether Boardwalk Pipeline’s strategy continues to be successful; and            ·   the effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices.         The northeastern terminus of the Texas Gas pipeline system is in Lebanon, Ohio, where it connects with other interstate natural gas pipelines delivering natural gas to East Coast and Midwest metropolitan areas and other indirect markets. Pipeline capacity into Lebanon is approximately 48.0% greater than pipeline capacity leaving that point, creating a bottleneck for supply into areas of high demand. Approximately 21.0% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s long-term contracts with firm deliveries to Lebanon expire by the end of 2007. While demand for natural gas from Boardwalk Pipeline’s Lebanon, Ohio terminus and other interconnects in that region has remained strong in the past, there can be no assurance regarding continued demand for gas from the Gulf Coast region, including East Texas, in the face of other          44                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             sources of natural gas for various indirect markets, including pipelines from Canada, a new proposed pipeline from the Rockies, and new LNG facilities proposed to be constructed along the East Coast.   Boardwalk Pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues.  Boardwalk Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, ProLiance Energy, LLC and Atmos Energy accounted for approximately 18.4%, 20.1% and 32.3% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s total operating revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of these contracts and those with other key customers on favorable terms as a result of competition, creditworthiness or for other reasons.   Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers.   Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to credit risk from the nonperformance by its customers of their contractual obligations, in large part relating to volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned to them, generally under parking and lending services and no-notice services. If any significant customer of Boardwalk Pipeline should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas they owe Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s financial condition, results of operation and cash flows. Please read information on credit risk included in Credit Risk under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   Boardwalk Pipeline depends on third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to its pipelines.   Boardwalk Pipeline depends upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from its pipelines. For example, Gulf South’s pipeline system can deliver approximately 500.0 Mcf per day to a major pipeline connection with Texas Eastern at Kosciusko, Mississippi. If this or any other pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facility, lack of capacity or any other reason, Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnect could cause a material reduction in volumes transported on or stored at facilities of Boardwalk Pipeline.  Significant changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand, and reduce system throughput.   Higher natural gas prices could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in the throughput on the Boardwalk Pipeline systems. In addition, reduced price volatility could reduce the revenues generated by Boardwalk Pipeline’s parking and lending and interruptible storage services. In general terms, the price of natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in supply, changes in demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. These factors include:         ·   worldwide economic conditions;             ·   weather conditions and seasonal trends;             ·   levels of domestic production and consumer demand;             ·   the availability of LNG;             ·   a material decrease in the price of natural gas could have an adverse effect on the shippers who have contracted for capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s planned expansion projects;            ·   the availability of adequate transportation capacity;             ·   the price and availability of alternative fuels;             ·   the effect of energy conservation measures;             ·   the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation; and            45                Item 1A. Risk Factors                 ·   the anticipated future prices of natural gas, LNG and other commodities.       Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide. Oil and gas prices, market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity. However, higher commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased drilling activity since Diamond Offshore’s customers’ expectations of future commodity prices typically drive demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, including:        ·   the political environment of oil-producing regions, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities in the Middle East or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;            ·   worldwide demand for oil and gas;            ·   the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;            ·   the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;            ·   the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;            ·   available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity;            ·   the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;            ·   weather conditions in the United States and elsewhere;            ·   the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing;            ·   the level of production in non-OPEC countries;            ·   the policies of the various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves; and            ·   advances in exploration and development technology.        Diamond Offshore’s industry is cyclical.  Diamond Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates (such as Diamond Offshore is currently experiencing in the markets in which it operates), followed by periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time.   Current oil and natural gas prices are significantly above historical averages, which has resulted in higher utilization and dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s drilling units, generally beginning in the third quarter of 2004. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that the current industry cycle of high demand, short rig supply and higher dayrates will continue. Diamond Offshore may be required to idle rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts in response to market conditions in the future.       46                Item 1A. Risk Factors           Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.  The terms of some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may limit its ability to benefit from increasing dayrates in a rising market.  The duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by market demand and the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractor and its customers. In periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors typically prefer well-to-well contracts that allow contractors to profit from increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level. Conversely, in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, contractors generally prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers prefer well-to-well contracts that allow them to obtain the benefit of lower dayrates.   To the extent possible, Diamond Offshore seeks to have a foundation of long-term contracts with a reasonable balance of single-well, well-to-well and short-term contracts to minimize the downside impact of a decline in the market while still participating in the benefit of increasing dayrates in a rising market. However, Diamond Offshore cannot be sure that it will be able to achieve or maintain such a balance from time to time. Diamond Offshore’s inability to fully benefit from increasing dayrates in a rising market due to the long-term nature of its contracts, may adversely impact its profitability.  The majority of Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units are fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability of those contracts.  Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred. Many of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate clauses, Diamond Offshore may be unable to recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers.  Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control.  Diamond Offshore’s customers may terminate some of their drilling contracts if the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts. These termination payments may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time. During depressed market conditions, Diamond Offshore’s customers may also seek renegotiation of firm drilling contracts to reduce their obligations.  Rig conversions, upgrades or newbuilds may be subject to delays and cost overruns.  From time to time, Diamond Offshore may undertake to add new capacity through conversions or upgrades to rigs or through new construction. Diamond Offshore has entered into agreements to upgrade two of its drilling units to ultra-deepwater capability at an estimated aggregate cost of $553.0 million. The shipyard portion of the upgrade of one rig has been completed, and Diamond Offshore expects that the unit will return to the Gulf of Mexico in mid-2007. Diamond Offshore expects delivery of its other semisubmersible unit during the fourth quarter of 2008. Diamond Offshore also has entered into agreements to construct two new jack-up drilling units with delivery expected in the first quarter of 2008 at an aggregate cost of approximately $320.0 million, including drillpipe and capitalized interest. These projects and other projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:       47                Item 1A. Risk Factors                 ·   shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;            ·   work stoppages;           ·   unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;           ·   unanticipated cost increases;            ·   weather interferences;            ·   difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;           ·   design and engineering problems;            ·   shipyard failures; and           ·   failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes.       Failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract.  Diamond Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards and Diamond Offshore is not fully insured against all of them.  Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, punchthroughs, craterings and natural disasters such as hurricanes or fires. The occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations and environmental damage. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. In addition, offshore drilling operators are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Damage to the environment could also result from our operations, particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires. Diamond Offshore may also be subject to damage claims by oil and gas companies or other parties.  Pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable, and Diamond Offshore does not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover its rigs. Diamond Offshore’s insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover its losses, or may have exclusions of coverage for some losses. Diamond Offshore does not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks, including, among other things, war risk, liability risk for certain amounts of excess coverage and certain physical damage risk. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will necessarily be financially able to indemnify it against all these risks. In addition, no assurance can be made that Diamond Offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that it will be able to obtain insurance against some risks.  Diamond Offshore significantly increased its insurance deductibles and has elected to self-insure for a portion of its liability exposure and for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.   Because the amount of insurance coverage available to Diamond Offshore has been significantly limited and the cost for such coverage has increased substantially, Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for a portion of its liability exposure and for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Although Diamond Offshore continues to carry physical damage insurance for certain other losses, Diamond Offshore significantly increased its deductibles to offset or mitigate premium increases. Diamond Offshore’s deductible for physical damage insurance is currently $150.0 million per occurrence (or lower for some rigs if they are declared a constructive total loss). Diamond Offshore continues to carry liability insurance with coverages similar to prior years, except that Diamond Offshore elected to self-insure for a portion of its excess liability coverage related to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Diamond Offshore’s deductible for liability coverage generally has increased to $5.0 million per occurrence, but its deductibles arising in connection with certain liabilities relating to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have increased to $10.0 million per occurrence, with no annual aggregate deductible. To the extent that Diamond Offshore incurs certain liabilities related to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in excess          48                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             of $75.0 million, Diamond Offshore is self-insured for up to a maximum retention of $17.5 million per occurrence in addition to these deductibles. These changes result in a higher risk of losses that are not covered by third party insurance contracts. If named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause significant damage to Diamond Offshore’s rigs or equipment or to the property of others for which it may be liable, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   Diamond Offshore’s international operations involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations.  Diamond Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world that may expose it to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:        ·   terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances;            ·   piracy;            ·   kidnapping of personnel;            ·   expropriation of property or equipment;            ·   foreign and domestic monetary policy;            ·   the inability to repatriate income or capital;            ·   regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions; and            ·   changing taxation policies.      In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and regulations relating to:        ·   the equipping and operation of drilling units;            ·   repatriation of foreign earnings;            ·   oil and gas exploration and development;            ·   taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and            ·   use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.        No prediction can be made as to what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments, including initiatives by OPEC, may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete.  Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts in the Mexican GOM expose it to greater risks than they normally assume.  As of the date of this report, Diamond Offshore has three intermediate semisubmersible rigs and one jack-up rig drilling offshore Mexico under contract with PEMEX, the national oil company of Mexico, and has two additional intermediate semisubmersibles contracted to begin working for PEMEX in the third quarter of 2007. The terms of these contracts expose Diamond Offshore to greater risks than they normally assume, such as exposure to greater environmental liability, and can be terminated by PEMEX on short-term notice, contractually or by statute, subject to certain conditions. While Diamond Offshore believes that the financial terms of these contracts and its operating safeguards in place mitigate these risks, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have a negative impact on our future operations or financial results.       49                Item 1A. Risk Factors           Fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses.  Due to Diamond Offshore’s international operations, Diamond Offshore may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. Diamond Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally  In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, terrorism, hurricanes and other natural disasters, competition, government regulation, dependence on key executives and employees, litigation, dependence on information technology and compliance with environmental laws.   Future acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.  Future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad, as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on the businesses of certain of our subsidiaries, including the following:  CNA. CNA may bear substantial losses from future acts of terrorism. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (“TRIEA”) extended, until December 31, 2007, the program established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. Under this program, insurers are required to offer terrorism insurance and the federal government will share the risk of loss by commercial property and casualty insurers arising from future terrorist attacks. TRIEA does not provide complete protection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism. Please read information on TRIEA included in the MD&A under Item 7.  Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk Pipeline. The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies might lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for oil and natural gas, which could affect the market for DiamondOffshore’s oil and gas offshore drilling services and Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering and storage services. In addition, it has been reported that terrorists might target domestic energy facilities. While Diamond Offshore and Boardwalk Pipeline take steps that they believe are appropriate to increase the security of their energy assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure their assets, completely protect them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.   Loews Hotels. The travel and tourism industry went into a steep decline in the periods following the 2001 World Trade Center event which had a negative impact on the occupancy levels and average room rates at Loews Hotels. Future terrorist attacks could similarly lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels.  Certain of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to the impact of hurricanes and other natural disasters.  In addition to CNA’s exposure to catastrophe losses discussed above, the businesses operated by several of our other subsidiaries are exposed to significant harm from the effects of natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and related flooding and other damage. While much of the damage caused by natural disasters is covered by insurance, we cannot be sure that such coverage will be available or be adequate in all cases. These risks include the following:  Boardwalk Pipeline. A substantial portion of the Gulf South pipeline assets and a smaller portion of the Texas Gas pipeline assets are located in the Gulf Coast region of the United States and, as such, are exposed to the impact of hurricanes, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita which struck that region in 2005. Boardwalk Pipeline experienced a variety of damage from those storms, including damage to its physical facilities and rights of way, loss of customers, such as the City of New Orleans, damaged or destroyed by the storm and loss of natural gas supply from facilities of suppliers damaged or destroyed by the storm. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline could be required to relocate some of its pipeline facilities, possibly at its expense, as the Gulf Coast region is reconstructed.       50                Item 1A. Risk Factors           Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore operates its offshore rig fleet in waters that can be severely impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters, including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In late August 2005, one of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the Ocean Warwick, was seriously damaged during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in Diamond’s fleet and its warehouse in New Iberia, Louisiana sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, or in some cases both storms. In addition to damaging or destroying rig equipment, some or all of which may be covered by insurance, catastrophes of this kind result in additional operating expenses for Diamond, including the cost of reconnaissance aircraft, rig crew over-time and employee assistance, hurricane relief supplies, temporary housing and office space and the rental of mooring equipment and others which may not be covered by insurance.  Loews Hotels. Hotels operated by Loews Hotels are exposed to damage, business interruption and reductions in travel and tourism in markets affected by significant natural disasters such as hurricanes. For example, Loews Hotels’ properties located in Florida and New Orleans suffered significant damage from hurricanes and related flooding during the past two years.   Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations.   The businesses operated by certain of our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal, state and local governmental regulations which imposes or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies. Governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies. Risks faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following:   CNA. The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders rather than its investors. Each state in which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which CNA does business. Their regulations relate to, among other things:        ·   standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;            ·   restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;            ·   restrictions on CNA’s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance;            ·   the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;            ·   the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;            ·   potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies;            ·   licensing of insurers and agents;            ·   approval of policy forms; and            ·   limitations on the ability of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.        Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. CNA also is required by the states to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.  Lorillard. A wide variety of federal and state laws and local regulations limit the advertising, sale and use of cigarettes, and these laws have proliferated in recent years. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) is granted authority to regulate tobacco products, as has been proposed for many years, Lorillard believes such regulation would          51                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             provide Philip Morris, as the largest tobacco company in the country, with a competitive advantage. Lorillard believes that FDA regulations could:        ·   require larger and more severe health warnings on packs and cartons;             ·   ban the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as “low-tar” and “light”;             ·   require the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers;             ·   require pre-market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products;             ·   allow the FDA to require the reduction or elimination of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes;             ·   allow the FDA to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes;             ·   place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sales of cigarettes;             ·   permit state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation; and             ·   grant the FDA the authority to impose broad additional restrictions.       In addition, some states have enacted or proposed regulations, including with respect to mandatory disclosure of ingredients, including flavorings, some of which are trade secrets. State and local laws or rules that prohibit or restrict smoking in public places and workplaces continue to be enacted and proposed. Lorillard cannot predict the ultimate impact of these laws or regulatory proposals, but believes they will continue to reduce sales and increase costs. Extensive and inconsistent regulation by multiple states could prove to be particularly disruptive to Lorillard’s business.   Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC and the United States Department of Transportation, among other federal and state authorities. In addition to the FERC rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its services, the FERC’s regulatory authority also extends to:        ·   operating terms and conditions of service;             ·   the types of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer to its customers;             ·   construction of new facilities;             ·   acquisition, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;             ·   accounts and records; and             ·   relationships with affiliated companies involved in all aspects of the natural gas and electricity businesses.       The FERC action in any of these areas or modifications of its current regulations can adversely impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, the costs incurred in its operations, the construction of new facilities or Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. Another example is the time the FERC takes to approve the construction of new facilities, which could give Boardwalk Pipeline’s non-regulated competitors time to offer alternative projects or raise the costs of Boardwalk Pipeline’s projects to the point where they are no longer economical.  The United States Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety has issued a final rule requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and          52                  Item 1A. Risk Factors            take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rule refers to as high consequence areas (“HCAs”) where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.    Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore’s operations are affected from time to time in varying degrees by governmental laws and regulations. The drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or may significantly limit drilling activity.  The businesses operated by our subsidiaries face intense competition.  Each of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries faces intense competition in its industry and will be harmed materially if it is unable to compete effectively. Certain of the competitive risks faced by those companies include:  CNA. All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. CNA may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. In addition, the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 has encouraged growth in the number, size and financial strength of CNA’s potential competitors by removing barriers that previously prohibited holding companies from simultaneously owning commercial banks, insurers and securities firms.  Lorillard. The cigarette market is highly concentrated, as Lorillard’s two major competitors, Philip Morris USA and Reynolds American, Inc., had a combined market share of approximately 77.1% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Reynolds American owns the third and fourth leading menthol brands, Kool and Salem, which had a combined share of the menthol segment of approximately 18.3% for the year ended December 31, 2006. This concentration of U.S. market share could make it more difficult for Lorillard to compete for shelf space in retail outlets, access to which is already exacerbated by the restrictive marketing programs of these larger competitors, and could impact price competition among menthol brands.  In addition to competing with major cigarette makers, Lorillard competes with a significant number of smaller competitors, many of which are not subject to the same payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements as Lorillard and thereby enjoy competitive cost and pricing advantages. As a result of their cost and pricing advantages, the smaller manufacturers have developed meaningful market share, principally in the deep discount cigarette segment. Lorillard’s focus on the premium market and its obligations under the State Settlement Agreements make it very difficult to compete successfully in the deep discount market.   Diamond Offshore. The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than Diamond Offshore. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job, although rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered. Mergers among oil and natural gas exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available customers.  Diamond Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates (such as we are currently experiencing), followed by periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and lower dayrates. Periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time.  Although oil and natural gas prices are currently significantly above historical averages, resulting in higher utilization and dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s drilling units, generally beginning in the third quarter of 2004, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that the current industry cycle of high demand, short rig supply and higher dayrates will continue. Diamond Offshore may be required to idle rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts in response to market conditions in the future.       53                Item 1A. Risk Factors           Significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition. Diamond Offshore believes that there are currently 100 jack-up rigs and floaters (semisubmersible rigs and drillships) on order and scheduled for delivery between 2007 and 2010. Improvements in dayrates and expectations of sustained improvements in rig utilization rates and dayrates may result in the construction of additional new rigs. These increases in rig supply could result in depressed rig utilization and greater price competition from both existing competitors, as well as new entrants into the offshore drilling market. As of the date of this report, not all of the rigs currently under construction have contracted for future work, which may further intensify price competition as scheduled delivery dates occur. In addition, competing contractors are able to adjust localized supply and demand imbalances by moving rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates.   Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline competes primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines in the transportation and storage of natural gas. Natural gas also competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The principal elements of competition among pipelines are rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability. The FERC’s policies promoting competition in gas markets are having the effect of increasing the gas transportation options for Boardwalk Pipeline’s traditional customer base. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems or, in cases where Boardwalk Pipeline does not have long-term fixed rate contracts, could force Boardwalk Pipeline to lower its transportation or storage rates. Competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that significantly decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, such as competing or alternative forms of energy, a recession or other adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes against a number of intrastate pipelines which have significant regulatory advantages over its and other interstate pipelines because of the absence of FERC regulation. In view of potential rate increases, construction and service flexibility available to intrastate pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline may lose customers and throughput to intrastate competitors.  We and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation.  We and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation in the normal course of business. Litigation is costly and time consuming to defend and could result in a material expense. Please read information on litigation included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Certain of the litigation risks faced by us and our subsidiaries are as follows:  CNA. CNA faces substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims and APMT matters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered by reserves that CNA has established. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify and may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts that include punitive or treble damages. Accordingly, unfavorable results in these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.  Lorillard. As discussed in more detail above, Lorillard is a defendant in a large number of tobacco-related cases and other litigation, in some instances seeking damages from Lorillard ranging into the billions of dollars. We are a defendant in certain of these cases as well.   We and our subsidiaries are each dependent on a small number of key executives and other key personnel to operate our businesses successfully.   Our success and the success of our operating subsidiaries substantially depends upon each company’s ability to attract and retain high quality executives and other qualified employees. In many instances, there may be only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we and our subsidiaries compete and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the successful implementation of our and our subsidiaries’ business strategies. For example, Lorillard is currently experiencing difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified personnel in some areas of its business, due primarily to the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry. In addition, Diamond Offshore has experienced and continues to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages and increased competition for skilled workers as a result of the          54                 Item 1A. Risk Factors             strengthening offshore drilling market. Diamond Offshore has also sustained the loss of experienced personnel to competitors. In response to these market conditions, Diamond Offshore has implemented retention programs, including increases in compensation.   Certain of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.  Certain of our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and/or financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws or. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent in recent years, and may in some cases impose “strict liability,” rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. These laws and regulations may expose us and our subsidiaries to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. For example:        ·   as discussed in more detail above, many of CNA’s policyholders have made claims for defense costs and indemnification in connection with environmental pollution matters;            ·   as an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable U.S. waters and some offshore areas, Diamond Offshore may be liable for, among other things, damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to those operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed;            ·   the risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in natural gas transportation, gathering and storage, including with respect to, among other things, the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from Boardwalk’s facilities, compliance with clean air standards and the abandonment and reclamation of Boardwalk’s facilities, sites and other properties; and            ·   Bulova no longer manufactures time pieces; however, it has substantial ongoing clean-up obligations and will continue to incur substantial costs, which could exceed Bulova’s current estimates, related to contaminated properties that were previously operated by Bulova as manufacturing sites.
