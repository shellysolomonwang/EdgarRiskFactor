Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.  Our business faces many risks. We have described below some of the more significant risks which we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries.  Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, financial condition or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries.  You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the SEC or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, are public companies and file reports with the SEC. You are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries before investing in any of their securities.  We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.  We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and our creditors and shareholders.       23          Item 1A. Risk Factors   Continued deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to additional investment losses and lower cash balances at the parent company, which could impair our ability to fund acquisitions, share buybacks, dividends or other investments or to fund capital needed by our subsidiaries .  For more than a year, we have been experiencing severe volatility, illiquidity, uncertainty and disruption in the capital and credit markets and the overall economy, including among other things, large bankruptcies, government intervention in a number of large financial institutions, growing levels of defaults on indebtedness, recessionary economic conditions and widening of credit spreads. These conditions resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses and substantially reduced investment income, including a significant decline in income from limited partnership investments, at CNA and the parent company during 2008. Continued deterioration of the economy and the credit and capital markets, including lower pricing levels of fixed income and equity securities, could result in further such losses and further reduced investment income, which would among other things reduce the cash balances available at the parent company. Please see MD&A under Item 7 of this Report for additional information on our Investments.  Certain of our operating subsidiaries require substantial amounts of capital or other financial support from time to time to fund expansions, enhance capital, refinance indebtedness or satisfy rating agency or regulatory requirements or for other reasons. Sufficient capital to satisfy these needs may not be available to our subsidiaries when needed on acceptable terms from the credit or capital markets or other third parties. In such cases, we have in the past, and may in the future, provide substantial amounts of debt or equity capital to our subsidiaries, which may not be on market terms. Any such investments further reduce the amount of cash available at the parent company which might otherwise be used to fund acquisitions, share buybacks, dividends or other investments or to fund other capital requirements of our subsidiaries. In addition, significantly reduced levels of cash at the parent company could make us unable or unwilling to fund future capital needs of our subsidiaries and result in a downgrade of our ratings by the major credit rating agencies.  We could have liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.  As a result of our ownership of Lorillard prior to the Separation, which was consummated in June 2008, from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits. We are currently a defendant in four such lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the Separation. In the Separation Agreement entered into between us and Lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business, including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. An adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and equity. We do not expect that the Separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity with respect to tobacco-related claims. We do not believe that we had or have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation  CNA may continue to incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from the severe disruption in the capital and credit markets.  CNA maintains a large portfolio of fixed income and equity securities, including large amounts of corporate and government issued debt securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed and other structured securities, equity and equity-based securities and investments in limited partnerships which pursue a variety of long and short investment strategies across a broad array of asset classes. CNA’s investment portfolio supports its obligation to pay future insurance claims and provides investment returns which are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability.  For more than a year, capital and credit markets have experienced severe levels of volatility, illiquidity, uncertainty and overall disruption. Despite government intervention, market conditions have led to the merger or failure of a number of prominent financial institutions and government sponsored entities, sharply increased unemployment and reduced economic activity. In addition, significant declines in the value of assets and securities that began with the residential sub-prime mortgage crisis have spread to nearly all classes of investments, including most of those held in CNA’s investment portfolio. As a result, during 2008 CNA incurred significant realized and unrealized losses in its investment       24            Item 1A. Risk Factors    portfolio and experienced substantial declines in its net investment income which have materially adversely impacted the Company’s results of operations and stockholders’ equity.  In addition, certain categories of CNA’s investments are particularly subject to significant exposures in the current market environment. Although CNA normally expects limited partnership investments to provide higher returns over time, since 2008, they have presented greater risk, greater volatility and higher illiquidity than CNA’s fixed income investments. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) also present greater risks due to the credit deterioration in the commercial real estate market. Notably, even senior tranches of CMBS have experienced significant price erosion due to market concerns involving the valuation and credit performance of commercial real estate.  If these economic and market conditions persist, CNA may continue to experience reduced investment income and to incur substantial additional realized and unrealized losses on its investments. As a result, the Company’s results of operations, and CNA’s business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted. Additional information on CNA’s investment portfolio is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA may continue to incur underwriting losses as a result of the global economic crisis.  Overall global economic conditions may continue to be recessionary and highly unfavorable. Although many lines of CNA’s business have both direct and indirect exposure to this economic crisis, the exposure is especially high for the lines of business that provide management and professional liability insurance, as well as surety bonds, to businesses engaged in real estate, financial services and professional services. As a result, CNA has experienced and may continue to experience unanticipated underwriting losses with respect to these lines of business. Additionally, CNA could experience declines in its premium volume and related insurance losses. Consequently, our results of operations, stockholders’ equity and CNA’s business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be adversely impacted.  CNA’s valuation of investments and impairment of securities requires significant judgment.  CNA’s investment portfolio is exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks, many of which are unpredictable. CNA exercises significant judgment in analyzing these risks and in validating fair values provided by third parties for securities in its investment portfolio that are not regularly traded. CNA also exercises significant judgment in determining whether the impairment of particular investments is temporary or other-than-temporary. Securities with exposure to sub-prime residential mortgage collateral or Alternative A (“Alt-A”) collateral are particularly sensitive to fairly small changes in actual collateral performance and assumptions as to future collateral performance.  During 2008, CNA incurred significant unrealized losses in its investment portfolio. In addition, CNA recorded significant other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) losses primarily in the corporate and other taxable bonds, asset-backed bonds and non-redeemable preferred equity securities sectors.  Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, CNA may incur further unrealized losses and conclude that further other-than-temporary write downs of its investments are required. As a result, the Company’s results of operations, and CNA’s business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted. Additional information on CNA’s investment portfolio is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA is unable to predict the impact of governmental efforts taken and proposed to be taken in response to the economic and credit crisis.  The Federal government has implemented various measures, including the establishment of the Troubled Assets Relief Program pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, in an effort to deal with the ongoing economic and credit crisis. In addition, there are numerous proposals for further legislative and regulatory actions at both the Federal and state levels, particularly with respect to the financial services industry. Since these new laws and regulations could involve critical matters affecting CNA’s operations, they may have an impact on CNA’s business and its overall financial condition. Due to this significant uncertainty, CNA is unable to determine whether its actions in response to       25            Item 1A. Risk Factors   these governmental efforts will be effective or to predict with any certainty the overall impact these governmental efforts will have on it.  CNA may continue to incur significant losses from its investments in financial institutions.  CNA’s investment portfolio includes preferred stock and hybrid debt securities issued by banks and other financial institutions. To date, government sponsored efforts to recapitalize the financial system both in the United States, as well as overseas, have been inconsistent and unpredictable. The uncertainty surrounding these efforts and their potential impact on existing financial institution securities has caused these securities to experience adverse price movement and rating agency downgrades. If this uncertainty continues or if regulatory decisions negatively affect CNA’s investments in financial institutions, CNA may continue to incur significant losses in its investment portfolio. As a result, the Company’s results of operations and CNA’s, business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted. Additional information on CNA’s investment portfolio is included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings for CNA, and thereby adversely affect CNA’s ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.  Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as its public debt, are rated by rating agencies, namely, A.M. Best Company, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s. Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debtholders.  Due to the intense competitive environment in which CNA operates, the severe disruption in the capital and credit markets, the uncertainty in determining reserves and the potential for CNA to take material unfavorable development in the future, and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies, the rating agencies may take action to lower CNA’s ratings in the future. If CNA’s property and casualty insurance financial strength ratings were downgraded below current levels, its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain markets, and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves. Recently, Moody’s and A.M. Best have revised their outlook on CNA from stable to negative.  In addition, it is possible that a lowering of our debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse impact on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s circumstances. CNA has entered into several settlement agreements and assumed reinsurance contracts that require collateralization of future payment obligations and assumed reserves if its ratings or other specific criteria fall below certain thresholds. The ratings triggers are generally more than one level below CNA’s current ratings. Please read information on CNA’s ratings included in the MD&A under Item 7.  CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.  Insurance companies such as CNA are subject to risk-based capital standards set by state regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. These standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of CNA’s statutory capital and surplus reported in CNA’s statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the risk-based capital formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, state regulators may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business. If CNA is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimates or circumstances, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital. Examples of events leading CNA to record a material charge against earnings include impairment of its investments or unexpectedly poor claims experience.  During the fourth quarter of 2008, CNA took several actions to replenish its capital position and bolster the statutory surplus of its operating insurance subsidiaries. One of these actions was the November 7, 2008 purchase by Loews of       26            Item 1A. Risk Factors   12,500 shares of CNA’s non-voting cumulative preferred stock (“2008 Senior Preferred”) for $1.25 billion. Loews, which owned approximately 90% of CNA’s outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2008, has also provided CNA with substantial amounts of capital in prior years. Given the ongoing turmoil in the capital and credit markets, CNA may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all. In addition, Loews may be restricted in its ability or willingness to provide additional capital support to CNA. As a result, if CNA is in need of additional capital, CNA may be required to secure this funding from sources other than Loews on terms that are not favorable.  CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its working capital needs, are limited by state regulators in their ability to pay dividends.  CNA Financial Corporation is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Dividend payments, however, must be approved by the subsidiaries’ domiciliary state departments of insurance and are generally limited to amounts determined by formula, which varies by state. The formula for the majority of the states is the greater of 10% of the prior year statutory surplus or the prior year statutory net income, less the aggregate of all dividends paid during the twelve months prior to the date of payment. Some states, however, have an additional stipulation that dividends cannot exceed the prior year’s earned surplus. If CNA is restricted, by regulatory rule or otherwise, from paying or receiving inter-company dividends, CNA may not be able to fund its working capital needs and debt service requirements from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital, which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.  If CNA determines that loss reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims, CNA may need to increase its loss reserves.  CNA maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims and for future policy benefits. Reserves represent CNA management’s best estimate at a given point in time. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates derived by CNA, generally utilizing a variety of reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain, such as estimates of claims severity, frequency of claims, mortality, morbidity, expected interest rates, inflation, claims handling and case reserving policies and procedures, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Many of these uncertainties are not precisely quantifiable and require significant management judgment. As trends in underlying claims develop, particularly in so-called “long tail” or long duration coverages, CNA is sometimes required to add to its reserves. This is called unfavorable development and results in a charge to CNA’s earnings in the amount of the added reserves, recorded in the period the change in estimate is made. These charges can be substantial and can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity. Please read additional information on CNA’s reserves included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA is subject to uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves which can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict. Examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include:        ·    increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical products;            ·    the effects of accounting and financial reporting scandals and other major corporate governance failures, which have resulted in an increase in the number and size of claims, including director and officer and errors and omissions insurance claims;            ·    class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices;            ·    construction defect claims, including claims for a broad range of additional insured endorsements on policies;           27            Item 1A. Risk Factors         ·    clergy abuse claims, including passage of legislation to reopen or extend various statutes of limitations; and            ·    mass tort claims, including bodily injury claims related to silica, welding rods, benzene, lead and various other chemical exposure claims.      In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. In addition, CNA periodically undergoes state regulatory financial examinations, including review and analysis of its reserves. If estimated reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against CNA’s earnings for the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These changes could be substantial and could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and equity and CNA’s business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings.  Loss reserves for asbestos and environmental pollution are especially difficult to estimate and may result in more frequent and larger additions to these reserves.  CNA’s experience has been that establishing reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&E claim and claim adjustment expenses are subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported claims are subject to a higher degree of variability due to a number of additional factors, including among others:        ·    coverage issues, including whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether policy limits apply;            ·    inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories;            ·    continuing aggressive tactics of plaintiffs’ lawyers;            ·    the risks and lack of predictability inherent in major litigation;            ·    changes in the volume of asbestos and environmental pollution claims;            ·    the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on any umbrella or excess policies CNA has issued;            ·    the number and outcome of direct actions against CNA;            ·    CNA’s ability to recover reinsurance for these claims; and            ·    changes in the legal and legislative environment in which CNA operates.      As a result of this higher degree of variability, CNA has necessarily supplemented traditional actuarial methods and techniques with additional estimating techniques and methodologies, many of which involve significant judgment on the part of CNA. Consequently, CNA may periodically need to record changes in its claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the future in these areas in amounts that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings. Additional information on A&E claims is included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  Asbestos claims. The estimation of reserves for asbestos claims is particularly difficult in light of the factors noted above. In addition, CNA’s ability to estimate the ultimate cost of asbestos claims is further complicated by the following:        ·    inconsistency of court decisions and jury attitudes, as well as future court decisions;            ·    interpretation of specific policy provisions;            ·    allocation of liability among insurers and insureds;           28            Item 1A. Risk Factors         ·    missing policies and proof of coverage;            ·    the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties;            ·    novel theories asserted by policyholders and their legal counsel;            ·    the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants;            ·    uncertainties in predicting the number of future claims and which other insureds may be targeted in the future;            ·    volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands;            ·    increases in the number of non-impaired claimants and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims;            ·    the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage that is not subject to aggregate limits;            ·    the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation, as well as the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims;            ·    medical inflation trends;            ·    the mix of asbestos-related diseases presented; and            ·    the ability to recover reinsurance.      In addition, a number of CNA’s insureds have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. If these insureds are successful in this regard, CNA’s potential liability for their claims would be unlimited. Some of these insureds contend that their asbestos claims fall within the so-called “non-products” liability coverage within their policies, rather than the products liability coverage, and that this “non-products” liability coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit. It is difficult to predict the extent to which these claims will succeed and, as a result, the ultimate size of these claims.  Environmental pollution claims. The estimation of reserves for environmental pollution claims is complicated by liability and coverage issues arising from these claims. CNA and others in the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims. In addition to the coverage issues noted in the asbestos claims section above, key coverage issues in environmental pollution claims include the following:        ·    whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies (and accordingly whether CNA would be liable for these costs);            ·    the trigger of coverage, and the allocation of liability among triggered policies;            ·    the applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions;            ·    the potential for joint and several liability; and            ·    the definition of an occurrence.      To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues, thus adding to the uncertainty of the outcome of many of these claims.  Further, the scope of federal and state statutes and regulations determining liability and insurance coverage for environmental pollution liabilities have been the subject of extensive litigation. In many cases, courts have expanded the scope of coverage and liability for cleanup costs beyond the original intent of CNA’s insurance policies. In addition, the       29            Item 1A. Risk Factors   standards for cleanup in environmental pollution matters are unclear, the number of sites potentially subject to cleanup under applicable laws is unknown and the impact of various proposals to reform existing statutes and regulations is difficult to predict.  Catastrophe losses are unpredictable.  Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, severe winter weather, and fires, and their frequency and severity are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, and snow. The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves. In addition, as in the case of catastrophe losses generally, it can take a long time for the ultimate cost to CNA to be finally determined. As its claim experience develops on a particular catastrophe, CNA may be required to adjust reserves, or take unfavorable development, to reflect its revised estimates of the total cost of claims. CNA believes that it could incur significant catastrophe losses in the future. Therefore, our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted. Please read information on catastrophe losses included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA’s key assumptions used to determine reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings could vary significantly from actual experience.  CNA’s reserves and deferred acquisition costs for its long term care product offerings are based on certain key assumptions including morbidity, which is the frequency and severity of illness, sickness and diseases contracted, policy persistency, which is the percentage of policies remaining in force, interest rates, and future health care cost trends. If actual experience differs from these assumptions, the deferred acquisition asset may not be fully realized and the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add to reserves, or take unfavorable development. Therefore, our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings could be materially adversely impacted.  CNA’s premium writings and profitability are affected by the availability and cost of reinsurance.  CNA purchases reinsurance to help manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expenses in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of CNA’s business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost CNA deems acceptable, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of CNA’s underwriting commitments. Therefore, our financial results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. Please read information on reinsurance included in MD&A under Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers.  CNA has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables in the balance sheets and estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers have experienced deteriorating financial conditions or have been downgraded by rating agencies. A continuation or worsening of the current highly unfavorable global economic conditions, along with the severe disruptions in the capital and credit markets, could similarly impact all of CNA’s other reinsurers. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to it. If CNA is not able to collect the amounts due to it from reinsurers, its claims expenses will be higher. Please read information on reinsurance included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.       30            Item 1A. Risk Factors   Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices.  Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide. Worldwide demand for oil and gas, oil and gas prices, market expectations of potential changes in these prices and a variety of political and economic factors significantly affect this level of activity. However, higher or lower commodity demand and prices do not necessarily translate into increased or decreased drilling activity since Diamond Offshore’s customers’ project development time, reserve replacement needs, as well as expectations of future commodity demand and prices all combine to drive demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs. Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, including:        ·    worldwide demand for oil and gas;            ·    the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly called OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing;            ·    the level of production in non-OPEC countries;            ·    the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities in the Middle East, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas, further acts of terrorism in the United States or elsewhere;            ·    the worldwide economic environment or economic trends, such as recessions;            ·    the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;            ·    the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;            ·    the rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves;            ·    available pipeline and other oil and gas transportation capacity;            ·    the ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;            ·    weather conditions in the United States and elsewhere;            ·    the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;            ·    development and exploitation of alternative fuels;            ·    domestic and foreign tax policy; and            ·    advances in exploration and development technology.      The current global financial and credit crisis may have a negative impact on Diamond Offshore’s business and financial condition.  The recent worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations. The continued shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in equity markets could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession. Such deterioration has resulted in reduced demand for crude oil and natural gas, exploration and production activity and offshore drilling services that could lead to declining dayrates earned by Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs and a decrease in new contract activity. In addition, the current credit crisis and recession have had and could continue to have an impact on Diamond Offshore’s customers and suppliers, including among other things, causing them to fail to meet their       31            Item 1A. Risk Factors   obligations to Diamond Offshore. Similarly, the current credit crisis could affect lenders participating in Diamond Offshore’s credit facility, making them unable to fulfill their commitments and obligations. The current credit crisis could also limit Diamond Offshore’s ability to secure additional financing, if needed, due to difficulties accessing the capital markets, which could limit its ability to react to changing business and economic conditions.  Diamond Offshore’s industry is cyclical.  Diamond Offshore’s industry has historically been cyclical. There have been periods of high demand, short rig supply and high dayrates, followed by periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Diamond Offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such business cycles. Periods of excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods of time. In response to contraction in demand for Diamond Offshore’s services, it may be required to idle rigs or to enter into lower rate contracts. Prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates could also result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.  Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.  As of February 5, 2009, Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling backlog was approximately $10.3 billion for contracted future work extending, in some cases, until 2016. Contract backlog may include future earnings under both firm commitments and, in a few instances, anticipated commitments for which definitive agreements have not yet been executed. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that it will be able to perform under these contracts due to events beyond its control or that Diamond Offshore will be able to ultimately execute a definitive agreement where one does not currently exist. In addition, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its customers will be able to or willing to fulfill their contractual commitments. Diamond Offshore’s inability to perform under its contractual obligations or to execute definitive agreements or its customers’ inability to fulfill their contractual commitments may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.  Diamond Offshore relies heavily on a relatively small number of customers.  Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. However, the number of potential customers has decreased in recent years as a result of mergers among the major international oil companies and large independent oil companies. In 2008, Diamond Offshore’s five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 40% of its consolidated revenues. Diamond Offshore expects Petrobras, which accounted for approximately 13.0% of Diamond Offshore’s consolidated revenues in 2008 to continue to be a significant customer in 2009. While it is normal for Diamond Offshore’s customer base to change over time as work programs are completed, the loss of any major customer may have a material adverse effect on Diamond Offshore’s business.  The terms of some of Diamond Offshore’s dayrate drilling contracts may limit its ability to benefit from increasing dayrates in an improving market or to preserve dayrates and utilization during periods of decreasing dayrates.  The duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by customer requirements and, to a lesser extent, the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractors. In periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, contractors typically prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly profit from increasing dayrates. In contrast, during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level. Conversely, in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, contractors generally prefer longer term contracts, but often at flat or slightly lower dayrates to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of lower dayrates.  To the extent possible within the scope of its customer’s requirements, Diamond Offshore seeks to have a foundation of these long-term contracts with a reasonable balance of shorter term exposure to the spot market in an attempt to maintain upside potential while endeavoring to limit the downside impact of a potential decline in the market. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that it will be able to achieve or maintain such a balance from time to time.       32            Item 1A. Risk Factors   Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability of those contracts.  Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling units provide for the payment of a fixed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs incurred. Many of Diamond Offshore’s operating costs, such as labor costs, are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond Diamond Offshore’s control. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, Diamond Offshore may be unable to recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers.  Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may be terminated due to events beyond its control.  Diamond Offshore’s customers may terminate some of their drilling contracts if the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party. In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods by tendering contractually specified termination amounts. These termination payments may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of a contract. In addition, the early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time.  Diamond Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards and Diamond Offshore is not fully insured against all of them.  Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, punchthroughs, craterings and natural disasters such as hurricanes or fires. The occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel, damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations and environmental damage. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. In addition, offshore drilling operators are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Damage to the environment could also result from our operations, particularly through oil spillage or extensive uncontrolled fires. Diamond Offshore may also be subject to damage claims by oil and gas companies or other parties.  Pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable, and Diamond Offshore does not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover its rigs. Diamond Offshore’s insurance policies and contractual rights to indemnity may not adequately cover its losses, or may have exclusions of coverage for some losses. Diamond Offshore does not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks, including, among other things, liability risk for certain amounts of excess coverage and certain physical damage risk. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains or that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will necessarily be financially able to indemnify it against all these risks. In addition, no assurance can be made that Diamond Offshore will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that it will be able to obtain insurance against some risks.  Diamond Offshore is self-insured for a portion of physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  For physical damage due to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Diamond Offshore’s deductible is $75 million per occurrence (or lower for some rigs if they are declared a constructive total loss) with an annual aggregate limit of $125 million. Accordingly, Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage for all physical damage to its rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for the policy period that expires May 1, 2009 is limited to $125 million.       33            Item 1A. Risk Factors   Diamond Offshore’s international operations involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations.  Diamond Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world that may expose it to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:        ·    terrorist acts, war and civil disturbances;            ·    piracy or assaults on property or personnel;            ·    kidnapping of personnel;            ·    expropriation of property or equipment;            ·    renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;            ·    changing political conditions;            ·    foreign and domestic monetary policies;            ·    the inability to repatriate income or capital;            ·    fluctuations in currency exchange rates;            ·    regulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;            ·    travel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats; and            ·    changing taxation policies.      In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and regulations relating to:        ·    the equipping and operation of drilling units;            ·    repatriation of foreign earnings;            ·    oil and gas exploration and development;            ·    taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and            ·    use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.      Some foreign governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors, require use of a local agent or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These practices may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete in those regions. It is difficult to predict what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry. The actions of foreign governments, including initiatives by OPEC, may adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s ability to compete.       34            Item 1A. Risk Factors   Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts offshore Mexico expose it to greater risks than they normally assume.  Diamond Offshore currently operates and expects to continue to operate rigs drilling offshore Mexico for PEMEX - Exploracion Y Produccion (“PEMEX”), the national oil company of Mexico. The terms of these contracts expose Diamond Offshore to greater risks than they normally assume, such as exposure to greater environmental liability. In addition, each contract can be terminated by PEMEX on 30 days notice, contractually or by statute, subject to certain conditions.  Fluctuations in exchange rates and nonconvertibility of currencies could result in losses.  Due to Diamond Offshore’s international operations, Diamond Offshore may experience currency exchange losses where revenues are received and expenses are paid in nonconvertible currencies or where it does not hedge an exposure to a foreign currency. Diamond Offshore may also incur losses as a result of an inability to collect revenues because of a shortage of convertible currency available to the country of operation, controls over currency exchange or controls over the repatriation of income or capital. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that financial hedging arrangements will effectively hedge any foreign currency fluctuation losses that may arise.  Diamond Offshore may be required to accrue additional tax liability on certain of its foreign earnings.  Certain of Diamond Offshore’s international rigs are owned and operated, directly or indirectly, by Diamond Offshore International Limited (“DOIL”), a wholly-owned Cayman Islands subsidiary. Since forming this subsidiary it has been Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of this subsidiary to finance foreign operations. During 2007, DOIL made a non-recurring distribution to its U.S. parent company, and Diamond Offshore recognized U.S. federal income tax expense on the portion of the distribution that consisted of earnings of the subsidiary that had not previously been subjected to U.S. federal income tax. Notwithstanding the non-recurring distribution made in December of 2007, it remains Diamond Offshore’s intention to indefinitely reinvest the future earnings of DOIL to finance foreign activities, except for the earnings of Diamond East Asia Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of DOIL formed in December of 2008. It is Diamond Offshore’s intention to repatriate the earnings of Diamond East Asia Limited, and U.S. income taxes will be provided on such earnings. Diamond Offshore does not expect to provide for U.S. taxes on any future earnings generated by DOIL, except to the extent that these earnings are immediately subjected to U.S. federal income tax or as they relate to Diamond East Asia Limited. Should a future distribution be made from any unremitted earnings of this subsidiary, Diamond Offshore may be required to record additional U.S. income taxes that, if material, could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Rig conversions, upgrades or new builds may be subject to delays and cost overruns.  From time to time, Diamond Offshore may undertake to add new capacity through conversions or upgrades to rigs or through new construction. Projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:        ·    shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;            ·    work stoppages;            ·    unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;            ·    unanticipated cost increases;            ·    weather interferences;            ·    difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;            ·    design and engineering problems;            ·    customer acceptance delays;           35            Item 1A. Risk Factors         ·    shipyard failures or unavailability; and            ·    failure or delay of third party service providers and labor disputes.      Failure to complete a rig upgrade or new construction on time, or failure to complete a rig conversion or new construction in accordance with its design specifications may, in some circumstances, result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of a drilling contract, resulting in a loss of revenue to Diamond Offshore. If a drilling contract is terminated under these circumstances, Diamond Offshore may not be able to secure replacement contract with as favorable terms.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, HighMount Exploration & Production LLC  HighMount may not be able to replace reserves and sustain production at current levels. Replacing reserves is risky and uncertain and requires significant capital expenditures.  HighMount’s future success depends largely upon its ability to find, develop or acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless HighMount replaces the reserves produced through successful development, exploration or acquisition, its proved reserves will decline over time. HighMount may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future or to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs.  By their nature, undeveloped reserves are less certain. Thus, HighMount must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of reserves. HighMount expects to fund its capital expenditures with cash from its operating activities. If HighMount’s cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund its capital expenditure budget, there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available or available at favorable terms to meet those requirements.  Estimates of natural gas and NGL reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise.  Estimating the volume of proved natural gas and NGL reserves is a complex process and is not an exact science because of numerous uncertainties inherent in the process. The process relies on interpretations of available geological, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise. The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of:        ·    the quality and quantity of available data;            ·    the interpretation of that data;            ·    the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and            ·    the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.      Actual future production, commodity prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves most likely will vary from HighMount’s estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of HighMount’s reserves. In addition, HighMount may adjust estimates of proved reserves upward or downward to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing commodity prices and prevailing development expenses.  The timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and NGL properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10.0% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times, and the risks associated with our business, or the oil and gas industry in general, will affect the accuracy of the 10.0% discount factor.       36            Item 1A. Risk Factors   If commodity prices decrease, HighMount may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of its properties.  HighMount may be required, under full cost accounting rules, to write down the carrying value of its natural gas and NGL properties if commodity prices decline significantly, or if it makes substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves, or increases its estimates of development costs or experiences deterioration in its exploration results. HighMount utilizes the full cost method of accounting for its exploration and development activities. Under full cost accounting, HighMount is required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The ceiling test is an impairment test and generally establishes a maximum, or “ceiling,” of the book value of HighMount’s natural gas properties that is equal to the expected after tax present value (discounted at the required rate of 10.0%) of the future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges, calculated using prevailing prices on the last day of the period.  If the net book value of HighMount’s exploration and production (“E&P”) properties (reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability) exceeds its ceiling limitation, SEC regulations require HighMount to impair or “write down” the book value of its E&P properties. A write down may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas and NGL prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Depending on the magnitude of any future impairment, a ceiling test write down could significantly reduce HighMount’s income, or produce a loss. As ceiling test computations involve the prevailing price on the last day of the quarter, it is impossible to predict the timing and magnitude of any future impairment. Additional information on the ceiling test is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.  HighMount may incur significant goodwill impairment charges if market conditions deteriorate.  HighMount evaluates goodwill for impairment annually, or when events or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate, that would indicate an impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired when the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. HighMount’s annual impairment test, which is performed as of April 30th each year, is based on several factors requiring judgment. A significant decrease in expected cash flows or changes in market conditions may represent an impairment indicator requiring an assessment for the potential impairment of recorded goodwill. Also, a ceiling test impairment may represent a triggering event requiring HighMount to perform an interim period goodwill impairment test. Should market conditions continue to significantly deteriorate, including further declining commodity prices, HighMount could be required to record additional goodwill impairments that may be significant. Please read “Critical Accounting Estimates” in Part II, Item 7.  Natural gas, NGL and other commodity prices are volatile.  The commodity price HighMount receives for its production heavily influences its revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. HighMount is subject to risks due to frequent and often substantial fluctuations in commodity prices. NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and HighMount expects this volatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas and NGLs depend upon factors beyond HighMount’s control. These factors include demand, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including:        ·    the impact of market and basis differentials - market price spreads between two points across HighMount’s natural gas system;            ·    the impact of weather on the demand for these commodities;            ·    the level of domestic production and imports of these commodities;            ·    the impact of changes in technologies on the level of supply;            ·    natural gas storage levels;            ·    actions taken by foreign producing nations;            ·    the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems;           37            Item 1A. Risk Factors         ·    the availability and marketing of competitive fuels;            ·    the impact of energy conservation efforts; and            ·    the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.      Lower commodity prices may decrease HighMount’s revenues and may reduce the amount of natural gas and NGLs that HighMount can produce economically.  HighMount engages in commodity price hedging activities.  HighMount is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in commodity prices. The extent of HighMount’s commodity price risk is related to the effectiveness and scope of HighMount’s hedging activities. To the extent HighMount hedges its commodity price risk, HighMount will forego the benefits it would otherwise experience if commodity prices or interest rates were to change in its favor. Furthermore, because HighMount has entered into derivative transactions related to only a portion of the volume of its expected natural gas supply and production of NGLs, HighMount will continue to have direct commodity price risk on the unhedged portion. HighMount’s actual future supply and production may be significantly higher or lower than HighMount estimates at the time it enters into derivative transactions for that period.  As a result, HighMount’s hedging activities may not be as effective as HighMount intends in reducing the volatility of its cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of cash flows. In addition, even though HighMount’s management monitors its hedging activities, these activities can result in substantial losses. Such losses could occur under various circumstances, including if a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable hedging arrangement, the hedging arrangement is imperfect or ineffective, or HighMount’s hedging policies and procedures are not properly followed or do not work as planned.  Drilling for and producing natural gas and NGLs is a high risk activity with many uncertainties.  HighMount’s future success will depend in part on the success of its exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. HighMount’s E&P activities are subject to numerous risks beyond its control, including the risk that drilling will not result in oil and natural gas production volumes that are commercially viable. HighMount’s decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. HighMount’s cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following:        ·    lack of acceptable prospective acreage;            ·    inadequate capital resources;            ·    unexpected drilling conditions; pressure or irregularities in formations; equipment failures or accidents;            ·    adverse weather conditions;            ·    unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, labor or services;            ·    reductions in commodity prices;            ·    the impact of changes in technologies on commodity prices;            ·    limitations in the market for natural gas and NGLs;            ·    title problems;           38            Item 1A. Risk Factors         ·    compliance with governmental regulations; and            ·    mechanical difficulties.      HighMount’s business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.  HighMount is not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect HighMount’s business, financial condition or results of operations. HighMount’s E&P activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing natural gas and NGLs, including the possibility of:        ·    environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;            ·    abnormally pressured formations;            ·    mechanical difficulties, such as stuck drilling and service tools and casing collapse;            ·    fires and explosions;            ·    personal injuries and death; and            ·    natural disasters.      If any of these events occur, HighMount could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life, damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, suspension of HighMount’s operations and repairs to resume operations, any of which could adversely affect its ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses. HighMount may elect not to obtain insurance if the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP  Boardwalk Pipeline is undertaking large, complex expansion projects which involve significant risks that may adversely affect its business.  Boardwalk Pipeline is currently undertaking several large, complex pipeline and storage expansion projects and it may undertake additional expansion projects in the future. In pursuing these and previous projects, Boardwalk Pipeline experienced significant cost overruns and may experience cost increases in the future. Boardwalk Pipeline also experienced construction delays and may experience additional delays in the future. Delays in construction could result from a variety of factors and have resulted in penalties under customer contracts such as liquidated damage payments and could in the future result in similar losses. In some cases, certain customers could have the right to terminate their transportation agreements if the related expansion project is not completed by a date specified in their precedent agreements.  The cost overruns and construction delays Boardwalk Pipeline experienced have resulted from a variety of factors, including the following:        ·    delays in obtaining regulatory approvals;            ·    difficult construction conditions, including adverse weather conditions and encountering higher density rock formations than anticipated;            ·    delays in obtaining key materials; and            39             Item 1A. Risk Factors         ·    shortages of qualified labor and escalating costs of labor and materials resulting from the high level of construction activity in the pipeline industry.      In pursuing current or future expansion projects, Boardwalk Pipeline could experience additional delays or cost increases for the reasons described above or as a result of other factors. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to complete its current or future expansion projects on the expected terms, cost or schedule, or at all. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline cannot be certain that, if completed, these projects will perform in accordance with its expectations. Other areas of Boardwalk Pipeline’s business may suffer as a result of the diversion of management’s attention and other resources from other business concerns to its expansion projects. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its expansion projects. Please read Item 1, “Business – Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP – Expansion Projects,” for more information.  Completion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s expansion projects will require Boardwalk Pipeline to raise significant amounts of debt and equity financing. Ongoing disruption of the credit and capital markets may hinder or prevent Boardwalk Pipeline and its customers from meeting future capital needs.  Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, experiencing extraordinary disruption and volatility following adverse changes in global capital markets. Recently, market conditions have resulted in numerous bankruptcies, insolvencies, forced sales of financial institutions as well as market intervention by governments around the globe. The debt and equity capital markets are exceedingly distressed and banks and other commercial lenders have substantially curtailed their lending activities as a result of, among other things, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk and current weak economic conditions. These circumstances continue to make it difficult to obtain funding.  As a result, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets and commercial credit markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets has diminished significantly. Many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity – at all or on terms similar to the debt being refinanced – and reduced and in some cases ceased to provide funding to borrowers. In some cases, lenders under existing revolving credit facilities have been unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations, including one lender under Boardwalk Pipeline’s revolving credit facility. If additional lenders under Boardwalk Pipeline’s credit facility were to fail to fund their share of the credit facility, Boardwalk Pipeline’s borrowing capacity could be further reduced. Although the Company has indicated that it is willing to invest additional capital in Boardwalk Pipeline to finance its expansion projects to the extent the public markets remain unavailable on acceptable terms, we have not committed to any transaction at this time and any additional investment by us would be subject to review and approval by Boardwalk Pipeline’s independent Conflicts Committee. Due to these factors, Boardwalk Pipeline cannot be certain that new debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms or that Boardwalk Pipeline will be able to continue to access the full amount of the remaining commitments under its revolving credit facility in the future.  These circumstances have impacted Boardwalk Pipeline’s business, or may impact its business in a number of ways including but not limited to:        ·    limiting the amount of capital available to Boardwalk Pipeline to fund new growth capital projects and acquisitions, which would limit Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to grow its business, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures and increase distributions to its unitholders;            ·    adversely affecting Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to refinance outstanding indebtedness at maturity on favorable or fair terms or at all; and            ·    weakening the financial strength of certain of Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, increasing the credit risk associated with those customers and/or limiting their ability to grow which could affect their ability to pay for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services or prompt them to reduce throughput or contracted capacity on its pipelines.           40            Item 1A. Risk Factors   A portion of the expected maximum daily capacity of Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline expansion projects is contingent on receiving and maintaining authority from PHMSA to operate at higher operating pressures.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to transport a portion of the expected maximum capacity on each of its expansion project pipelines is contingent on Boardwalk Pipeline’s receipt of authority to operate those pipelines at higher operating pressures under special permits issued by PHMSA. The ability to operate at higher operating pressures increases the transportation capacity of the pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline has received both the special permit and the authority to operate from PHMSA for the East Texas Pipeline, which was completed in 2008. Boardwalk Pipeline has also received the special permits for its Southeast and Gulf Crossing pipeline expansions and Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals, but Boardwalk Pipeline has not received authority from PHMSA to operate under these permits. Absent such authority, Boardwalk Pipeline will not be able to transport all of the contracted for quantities of natural gas on these pipelines. PHMSA retains discretion as to whether to grant, or to maintain in force, authority to operate a pipeline at higher operating pressures. To the extent PHMSA does not grant Boardwalk Pipeline authority to operate any of its expansion pipelines under a special permit or withdraws previously granted authority, Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation capacity made available to the market and its transportation revenues would be reduced.  Boardwalk Pipeline has discovered anomalies in a small number of pipe segments on its East Texas Pipeline. As a result, and as a prudent operator, Boardwalk Pipeline has elected to reduce operating pressure on this pipeline to 20.0% below its previous operating level, which was below the pipeline’s maximum non-special permit operating pressure. Boardwalk Pipeline does not expect to return to normal operating pressure, or to operate at higher pressure under the special permit, until after Boardwalk Pipeline has completed its investigation and remediation measures, as appropriate, and PHMSA has concurred with Boardwalk Pipeline’s determination to increase operating pressure. Operating at lower pressure reduces the amount of gas that can flow through a pipeline and therefore will reduce Boardwalk Pipeline’s expected revenues and cash flow from the affected pipeline. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline will incur costs to replace defective pipe segments on the East Texas Pipeline and expects to temporarily shut down this pipeline when performing the necessary remedial measures, up to and including replacing certain pipe segments. Boardwalk Pipeline cannot determine at this time the amount of costs it will incur or when it might raise the operating pressure on this pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline has not completed testing all of its expansion pipelines and could find anomalies on other pipelines which could have similar impacts with respect to those pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline will not receive authority from PHMSA to operate any of its expansion pipelines at higher pressures under special permits until it has fully tested and, as needed, remediated any anomalies on each such pipeline.  Boardwalk Pipeline is exposed to credit risk relating to nonperformance by its customers.  Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Boardwalk Pipeline’s exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by Boardwalk Pipeline to them under certain no-notice services and PAL services. If any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by Boardwalk Pipeline, or contracted for with Boardwalk Pipeline, or to repay the gas they owe Boardwalk Pipeline, it could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s business. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline’s FERC gas tariffs only allow Boardwalk Pipeline to require limited credit support in the event that Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation customers are unable to pay for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services. As contracts expire, the failure of any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers could also result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity. Item 7A of this Report contains more information on credit risk arising from gas loaned to customers.  Upon completion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s expansion projects, Boardwalk Pipeline’s customer mix will have changed, leading to changes in credit risk.  Historically, the customers accounting for the majority of Boardwalk Pipeline’s throughput and revenues have been gas marketers and LDCs with investment grade ratings. After completion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s current expansion projects, producers of natural gas as a group will comprise a significantly larger portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s throughput and revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline expects one producer to represent over 10.0% of its 2009 revenues. Historically producers have had lower credit ratings than LDCs and marketers. Therefore the expected change in Boardwalk Pipeline’s customer base could result in higher total credit risk. The loss of access to credit for any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s major customers, or a systemic loss of access to credit for any customer group in the aggregate,       41            Item 1A. Risk Factors   could reduce Boardwalk Pipeline’s receipt of payment for services rendered or otherwise reduce the level of services required by Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers.  Boardwalk Pipeline depends on certain key customers for a significant portion of its revenues. The loss of any of these key customers could result in a decline in its revenues.  Boardwalk Pipeline relies on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues. Boardwalk Pipeline may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts and key customers on favorable terms. The loss of all or even a portion of the contracted volumes of these customers, as a result of competition, creditworthiness or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s business, unless Boardwalk Pipeline is able to contract for comparable volumes from other customers at favorable rates.  Significant changes in energy prices could affect supply and demand, reduce system throughput and adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues and available cash.  Due to the natural decline in traditional gas production connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s system, Boardwalk Pipeline’s success depends on its ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas, which is dependent on factors beyond its control, including the price level of natural gas. In general terms, the price of natural gas fluctuates in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control. These factors include:        ·    worldwide economic conditions;            ·    weather conditions, seasonal trends and hurricane disruptions;            ·    the relationship between the available supplies and the demand for natural gas;            ·    the availability of LNG;            ·    the availability of adequate transportation capacity;            ·    storage inventory levels;            ·    the price and availability of alternative fuels;            ·    the effect of energy conservation measures;            ·    the nature and extent of, and changes in, governmental regulation and taxation; and            ·    the anticipated future prices of natural gas, LNG and other commodities.      Since the summer of 2008, the price level of natural gas has dropped substantially. It is difficult to predict future changes in gas prices, however the recent global economic slowdown would generally indicate a bias toward downward pressure on prices rather than an increase. Further downward movement in gas prices could negatively impact producers in nontraditional supply areas such as the Barnett Shale, the Bossier Sands, the Caney Woodford Shale and the Fayetteville Shale, including producers who have contracted for capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s expansion projects. Significant financial difficulties experienced by Boardwalk Pipeline’s producer customers could impact their ability to pay for services rendered or otherwise reduce their demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services.  High natural gas prices may result in a reduction in the demand for natural gas. A reduced level of demand for natural gas could reduce the utilization of capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, reduce the demand for Boardwalk Pipeline’s services and could result in the non-renewal of contracted capacity as contracts expire.       42            Item 1A. Risk Factors   Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to FERC’s rate-making policies which could limit Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.  Boardwalk Pipeline is subject to extensive regulations relating to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its transportation and storage operations. For the cost-based services Boardwalk Pipeline offers, FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge. The basic elements that FERC considers are the cost of providing the service, the volumes of gas being transported, how costs are allocated between services and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. While neither Gulf South nor Texas Gas has an obligation to file a rate case, Boardwalk Pipeline’s Gulf Crossing pipeline has an obligation to file either a rate case or a cost-and-revenue study within three years of being placed in service to justify its rates. Customers of Boardwalk Pipeline’s subsidiaries or FERC can challenge the existing rates on any of its pipelines. Such a challenge could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to establish reasonable transportation rates, to charge rates that would cover future increases in Boardwalk Pipeline’s costs or even to continue to collect rates to maintain its current revenue levels that are designed to permit a reasonable opportunity to recover current costs and depreciation and earn a reasonable return. Additionally, FERC can propose changes or modifications to any of its existing rate-related policies.  If Boardwalk Pipeline’s subsidiaries were to file a rate case or if Boardwalk Pipeline had to defend its rates in a proceeding commenced by a customer or FERC, Boardwalk Pipeline would be required, among other things, to establish that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in Boardwalk Pipeline’s cost of service is just and reasonable. Under current FERC policy, since Boardwalk Pipeline is a limited partnership and does not pay U.S. federal income taxes, this would require Boardwalk Pipeline to show that its unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to federal income taxation. To support such a showing Boardwalk Pipeline’s general partner may elect to require owners of Boardwalk Pipeline’s units to re-certify their status as being subject to U.S. federal income taxation on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline’s subsidiaries or Boardwalk Pipeline may attempt to provide other evidence. Boardwalk Pipeline can provide no assurance that the evidence it might provide to FERC will be sufficient to establish that Boardwalk Pipeline’s unitholders (or their ultimate owners) are subject to U.S. federal income tax liability on the income generated by Boardwalk Pipeline’s jurisdictional pipelines. If Boardwalk Pipeline is unable to make such a showing, FERC could disallow a substantial portion of the income tax allowance included in the determination of the maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline’s subsidiaries, which could result in a reduction of such maximum rates from current levels.  Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to recover all of its costs through existing or future rates. An adverse determination in any future rate proceeding brought by or against any of Boardwalk Pipeline’s subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its business.  Capacity leaving Boardwalk Pipeline’s Lebanon, Ohio terminus is limited.  The northeastern terminus of Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems is in Lebanon, Ohio, where it connects with other interstate natural gas pipelines delivering gas to Northeast, Midwest and East Coast markets. Pipeline capacity into Lebanon is significantly greater than pipeline capacity leaving that point, creating a bottleneck for supply into areas of high demand. This situation may be compounded when the new Rockies Express pipeline reaches Lebanon later in 2009 while the remaining segments of that pipeline downstream of Lebanon are still under construction. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 55.0% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s long-term contracts with firm deliveries to Lebanon will expire or have the ability to terminate by the end of 2010. Supply volumes from the Rocky Mountains, Canada and LNG import terminals may compete with and displace volumes from the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent in order to serve the Northeast, Midwest and East Coast markets.  Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time existing transportation contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 17.0% of the contracts for firm transportation capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, excluding agreements related to the expansion projects not yet in service, was due to expire on or before December 31, 2009. Upon expiration, Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to extend contracts with existing customers or obtain replacement contracts at favorable rates or on a long term basis. A key determinant of       43            Item 1A. Risk Factors   the value that customers can realize from firm transportation on a pipeline and the price they are willing to pay for transportation is the price differential between physical locations, which can be affected by, among other things, the availability of supply, available capacity, storage inventories, weather and general market demand in the respective areas.  The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond Boardwalk Pipeline’s control, including:        ·    existing and new competition to deliver natural gas to Boardwalk Pipeline’s markets;            ·    the growth in demand for natural gas in Boardwalk Pipeline’s markets;            ·    whether the market will continue to support long term contracts;            ·    the current price differentials, or market price spreads between two points on the Boardwalk Pipeline systems; and            ·    the effects of state regulation on customer contracting practices.      If third party pipelines and other facilities connected to Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas, its revenues could be adversely affected.  Boardwalk Pipeline depends upon third party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from its pipelines. For example, Boardwalk Pipeline is contractually committed to deliver approximately 1.8 Bcf per day to Transco Station 85. If this or any other significant pipeline connection were to become unavailable for current or future volumes of natural gas due to repairs, damage to the facilities, lack of capacity or any other reason, Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to continue shipping natural gas to end markets could be restricted, thereby reducing revenues.  Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which Boardwalk Pipeline may not be adequately insured.  There are a variety of operating risks inherent in Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations, such as leaks, explosions and mechanical problems. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations and substantial financial losses. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from some of these risks.  Boardwalk Pipeline currently possesses property, business interruption and general liability insurance, but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. Recent changes in the insurance markets have made it more difficult for Boardwalk Pipeline to obtain certain types of coverage. The insurance coverage Boardwalk Pipeline does obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain hazards or all potential losses.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally  In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face risks and uncertainties related to, among other things, terrorism, hurricanes and other natural disasters, competition, government regulation, dependence on key executives and employees, litigation, dependence on information technology and compliance with environmental laws.  Future acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.  Future terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in this country or abroad, as well as possible retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on the businesses of certain of our subsidiaries, including the following:       44            Item 1A. Risk Factors   CNA. CNA continues to face exposure to losses arising from terrorist acts, despite the passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 extended, until December 31, 2014, the program established within the U.S. Department of Treasury by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002. This program requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage and the federal government to share in insured losses arising from acts of terrorism. Given the unpredictability of the nature, targets, severity and frequency of potential terrorist acts, this program does not provide complete protection for future losses derived from acts of terrorism. Further, the laws of certain states restrict CNA’s ability to mitigate this residual exposure. For example, some states mandate property insurance coverage of damage from fire following a loss, thereby prohibiting CNA from excluding terrorism exposure. In addition, some states generally prohibit CNA from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers’ compensation policies. Consequently, there is substantial uncertainty as to CNA’s ability to contain its terrorism exposure effectively since CNA continues to issue forms of coverage, in particular, workers’ compensation, that are exposed to risk of loss from a terrorism act.  Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk Pipeline and HighMount. The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the United States and its allies might lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for oil and gas, which could affect the market for Diamond Offshore’s oil and gas offshore drilling services, Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation, gathering and storage services and HighMount’s natural gas exploration and production activities. In addition, it has been reported that terrorists might target domestic energy facilities. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to increase the security of their energy assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure their assets, completely protect them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.  Loews Hotels. The travel and tourism industry went into a steep decline in the periods following the 2001 World Trade Center event which had a negative impact on the occupancy levels and average room rates at Loews Hotels. Future terrorist attacks could similarly lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels.  Certain of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to the impact of hurricanes and other natural disasters.  In addition to CNA’s exposure to catastrophe losses discussed above, the businesses operated by several of our other subsidiaries are exposed to significant harm from the effects of natural disasters, particularly hurricanes and related flooding and other damage. While much of the damage caused by natural disasters is covered by insurance, we cannot be sure that such coverage will be available or be adequate in all cases. These risks include the following:  Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore operates its offshore rig fleet in waters that can be severely impacted by hurricanes and other natural disasters, including the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In September of 2008, one of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the Ocean Tower, was damaged in Hurricane Ike, losing its derrick, drill floor and drill floor equipment. In late August 2005, one of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up drilling rigs, the Ocean Warwick, was seriously damaged during Hurricane Katrina and other rigs in Diamond’s fleet and its warehouse in New Iberia, Louisiana sustained lesser damage in Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, or in some cases both storms. In addition to damaging or destroying rig equipment, some or all of which may be covered by insurance, catastrophes of this kind result in additional operating expenses for Diamond Offshore, including the cost of reconnaissance aircraft, rig crew over-time and employee assistance, hurricane relief supplies, temporary housing and office space and the rental of mooring equipment and others which may not be covered by insurance.  Boardwalk Pipeline. The nature and location of Boardwalk Pipeline’s business, particularly with regard to its assets in the Gulf Coast region, may make Boardwalk Pipeline susceptible to catastrophic losses especially from hurricanes or named storms. Various other events can cause catastrophic losses, including windstorms, earthquakes, hail, explosions, and severe winter weather and fires. The frequency and severity of these events are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of both the total amount of insured exposures in the affected areas and the severity of the events themselves. Although Boardwalk Pipeline carries insurance, in the event of a loss the coverage could be insufficient or there could be a material delay in the receipt of the insurance proceeds.  Loews Hotels. Hotels operated by Loews Hotels are exposed to damage, business interruption and reductions in travel and tourism in markets affected by significant natural disasters such as hurricanes. For example, Loews Hotels’ properties located in Florida and New Orleans suffered significant damage from hurricanes and related flooding during the past three years.       45            Item 1A. Risk Factors   Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local governmental regulations.  The businesses operated by certain of our subsidiaries are impacted by current and potential federal, state and local governmental regulations which imposes or might impose a variety of restrictions and compliance obligations on those companies. Governmental regulations can also change materially in ways that could adversely affect those companies. Risks faced by our subsidiaries related to governmental regulation include the following:  CNA. The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the United States. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders rather than its investors. Each state in which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which CNA does business. Their regulations relate to, among other things:        ·    standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;            ·    restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;            ·    restrictions on CNA’s ability to withdraw from unprofitable lines of insurance or unprofitable market areas;            ·    the required use of certain methods of accounting and reporting;            ·    the establishment of reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes;            ·    potential assessments for funds necessary to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers;            ·    licensing of insurers and agents;            ·    approval of policy forms;            ·    limitations on the ability of CNA’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; and            ·    limitations on the ability to non-renew, cancel or change terms and conditions in policies.      Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. CNA also is required by the states to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.  Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore’s operations are affected from time to time in varying degrees by governmental laws and regulations. The drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, is affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or may significantly limit drilling activity.  Governments in some foreign countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could materially and adversely affect Diamond Offshore’s operations by limiting drilling opportunities.  The Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, or MMS, has established guidelines for drilling operations in the GOM. Diamond Offshore believes that it is currently in compliance with the existing regulations set forth by the MMS with respect to its operations in the GOM; however, these regulations are continually       46            Item 1A. Risk Factors   under review. Implementation of additional MMS regulations may subject Diamond Offshore to increased costs of operating, or a reduction in the area and/or periods of operation, in the GOM.  HighMount. All of HighMount’s operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among other things: permits to drill and to conduct other operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; and the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area); the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties; maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells; venting or flaring of natural gas and the ratability of production.  HighMount’s operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants, and the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. In addition, HighMount’s operations may require it to obtain permits for, among other things, air emissions, discharges into surface waters, and the construction and operation of underground injection wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other non-hazardous oilfield wastes.  Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by FERC and the DOT among other federal and state authorities. In addition to FERC rules and regulations related to the rates Boardwalk Pipeline can charge for its services, FERC’s regulatory authority extends to:        ·    operating terms and conditions of service;            ·    the types of services Boardwalk Pipeline may offer to its customers;            ·    construction of new facilities;            ·    creation, extension or abandonment of services or facilities;            ·    accounts and records; and            ·    relationships with certain types of affiliated companies involved in the natural gas business.      FERC’s action in any of these areas or modifications of its current regulations can adversely impact Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to compete for business, to construct new facilities, offer new services or to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. This regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete an expansion project. The federal regulatory approval and compliance process could raise the costs of such projects to the point where they are no longer sufficiently timely or cost competitive when compared to competing projects that are not subject to the federal regulatory regime.  Under PHMSA regulations, Boardwalk Pipeline is required to develop and maintain integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along its pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what the rule refers to as high consequence areas where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.  The businesses operated by our subsidiaries face intense competition.  Each of the businesses operated by our subsidiaries faces intense competition in its industry and will be harmed materially if it is unable to compete effectively. Certain of the competitive risks faced by those companies include:  CNA. All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual       47            Item 1A. Risk Factors   insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. CNA may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices.  Diamond Offshore. The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than Diamond Offshore. The drilling industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job, although rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment may also be considered. Mergers among oil and gas exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available customers as well as the contraction of the global economy, increasing competition. Significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition. Diamond Offshore believes there are approximately 170 jack-up rigs and floaters on order and scheduled for delivery between 2009 and 2012. The resulting increase in rig supply could result in depressed rig utilization and greater price competition.  HighMount. HighMount competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business, including acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining goods, services and labor, including drilling rigs and well completion services. HighMount also competes in the marketing of produced natural gas and NGLs. Some of HighMount’s competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than HighMount. Factors that affect HighMount’s ability to acquire producing properties include available funds, available information about the property and standards established by HighMount for minimum projected return on investment. Competition for sales of natural gas and NGLs is also presented by alternative fuel sources, including heating oil, imported LNG and other fossil fuels.  Boardwalk Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline competes primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines in the transportation and storage of natural gas. Competition is particularly strong in the Midwest and Gulf Coast states where Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous existing pipelines and will compete with several new pipeline projects that are under construction, such as the Rockies Express Pipeline and the Mid-Continent Express Pipeline. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with other pipelines for contracts with producers that would support new growth projects. Natural gas also competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The principal elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability. The FERC’s policies promote competition in gas markets by increasing the number of gas transportation options available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customer base. Increased competition could reduce the volumes of gas transported by Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems or, in instances where Boardwalk Pipeline does not have long term contracts with fixed rates, could force Boardwalk Pipeline to decrease its transportation or storage rates. Competition could intensify the negative impact of factors that could significantly decrease demand for natural gas in the markets served by Boardwalk Pipeline’s systems, such as a recession or adverse economic conditions, weather, higher fuel costs and taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that directly or indirectly increase the cost or limit the use of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by competition.  The regulatory program that applies to interstate pipelines is different than the regulatory program that applies to many of Boardwalk Pipeline’s competitors that are not regulated interstate pipelines. This difference in regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete a project when it is regulated at the federal level. Boardwalk Pipeline competes against a number of intrastate pipelines which have significant regulatory advantages over Boardwalk Pipeline because of the absence of FERC regulation. In view of potential rate advantages and construction and service flexibility available to intrastate pipelines, Boardwalk Pipeline may lose customers and throughput to intrastate competitors.  We and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation.  We and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation in the normal course of business. Litigation is costly and time consuming to defend and could result in a material expense. Please read information on litigation included in the MD&A under Item 7 and Notes 9 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Certain of the litigation risks faced by us and our subsidiaries are as follows:       48            Item 1A. Risk Factors   CNA. CNA faces substantial risks of litigation and arbitration beyond ordinary course claims and A&E matters, which may contain assertions in excess of amounts covered by reserves that it has established. These matters may be difficult to assess or quantify and may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts that include punitive or treble damages.  We and our subsidiaries are each dependent on a small number of key executives and other key personnel to operate our businesses successfully.  Our success and the success of our operating subsidiaries substantially depends upon each company’s ability to attract and retain high quality executives and other qualified employees. In many instances, there may be only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we and our subsidiaries compete and the loss of one or more key employees or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the successful implementation of our and our subsidiaries’ business strategies. Diamond Offshore and HighMount have experienced upward pressure on salaries and wages and increased competition for skilled workers as a result of the strong drilling and oil and gas markets in recent years. Diamond Offshore has also sustained the loss of experienced personnel to competitors and customers. In response to these market conditions, Diamond Offshore and HighMount have implemented retention programs, including increases in compensation.  Certain of our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.  Certain of our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and/or financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent in recent years, and may in some cases impose “strict liability,” rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. These laws and regulations may expose us and our subsidiaries to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. For example:        ·    as discussed in more detail above, many of CNA’s policyholders have made claims for defense costs and indemnification in connection with environmental pollution matters;            ·    as an operator of mobile offshore drilling units in navigable U.S. waters and some offshore areas, Diamond Offshore may be liable for, among other things, damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to those operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed;            ·    the risk of substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in natural gas transportation, gathering and storage, including with respect to, among other things, the handling and discharge of solid and hazardous waste from Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, compliance with clean air standards and the abandonment and reclamation of Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, sites and other properties; and            ·    development, production and sale of natural gas and NGLs in the United States are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations, including those related to discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection, permits for drilling operations, bonds for ownership, development and production of oil and gas properties and reports concerning operations, which could result in liabilities for personal injuries, property damage, spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages, suspension or termination of HighMount’s operations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties.      Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.  There is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, may be linked to global climate change. Changing global weather patterns, particularly rising temperatures, have been associated with extreme weather events and could change longer-term natural catastrophe trends, including increasing the frequency and severity of hurricanes and other natural disasters which could increase future catastrophe losses at CNA and damage to property, disruption of business and higher operating costs at Diamond Offshore, Boardwalk Pipeline, HighMount and Loews Hotels.       49            Item 1A. Risk Factors   While there is currently no federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., it is anticipated that federal legislation, likely consisting of a cap and trade system, governing the emission of greenhouse gases will be enacted in the U.S. in the near future. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may regulate certain carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and some greenhouse gases may be regulated as “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act. Numerous states have already announced or adopted plans to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases for some industry sectors. Compliance with future laws and regulations requiring adoption of greenhouse gas control programs or imposing restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide could adversely affect the demand for and the cost to produce and transport oil and natural gas and could adversely affect the businesses of our energy subsidiaries.  The economic recession and ongoing financial and credit markets crisis have had and may continue to have a negative impact on the business and financial condition of us and our subsidiaries.  The recent financial and credit crisis has substantially reduced the availability of liquidity and credit available to businesses and consumers worldwide. The continued shortage of liquidity and credit, combined with substantial losses in equity and fixed income markets, has led to an economic recession in the United States and abroad. Such deterioration of the worldwide economy and credit and capital markets has and may continue to adversely affect the customers of our subsidiaries, including the ability of such customers to perform under contracts. The recession has also resulted in, and may result in further, reduced demand for certain of the products and services provided by our subsidiaries, including property casualty insurance, natural gas and gas transportation services, offshore drilling services and hotel rooms and related services. Such decline in demand could lead to lower revenues and earnings by our subsidiaries. We cannot predict if the actions being taken by the United States and other governments around the world to address this situation will be successful in reducing the severity or duration of this recession.
