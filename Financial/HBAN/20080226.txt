Item 1A: Risk Factors   Like other financial companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which is the risk that loan and lease customers or other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations, (2) market risk, which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, (3) liquidity risk, which is the risk that the parent company and/or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet its operating needs, and (4) operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events.   In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could materially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.  (1) Credit Risks:  The largest single contributor to our net loss in the fourth quarter of 2007, and our reduced net income in 2007 as compared with 2006, was $405.8 million in charge-offs and special reserves relating to our credit relationship with Franklin Credit Management Corporation (Franklin). This charge represents our best estimate of the inherent loss within this credit relationship. However, there can be no assurance that we will not incur further losses relating to the Franklin relationship.   As a result of our acquisition of Sky Financial, we have a significant loan relationship with Franklin. Franklin describes itself as a specialty consumer finance company primarily engaged in the servicing and resolution of performing, re-performing, and non-performing residential mortgage loans. Franklin’s portfolio consists of loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate that generally fall outside the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and involve elevated credit risk as a result of the nature or absence of income documentation, limited credit histories, higher levels of consumer debt or past credit difficulties. Franklin purchased these loan portfolios at a discount to the unpaid principal balances and originated loans with interest rates and fees calculated to provide a rate of return adjusted to reflect the elevated credit risk inherent in these types of loans. Franklin originated  10    Table of Contents  nonprime loans through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tribeca Lending Corp., and has generally held for investment the loans acquired and a significant portion of the loans originated. In its Current Report on Form 8-K, filed November 15, 2007, Franklin announced a delay in the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007. In the November 15, 2007 Form 8-K, Franklin stated that due to the rapidly deteriorating real estate and mortgage origination credit market and resulting increased delinquencies industry wide in mortgages originated in the years 2005 and 2006, particularly for second-lien loans, Franklin was in the process of reviewing and assessing its reserves for its portfolio of acquired loans, particularly second-lien mortgage loans acquired in those years. Franklin stated that this credit review would result in a substantial increase in the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, again particularly for its portfolio of second-lien loans. In its Current Report on Form 8-K, filed February 6, 2008, Franklin announced that while they previously believed that the reassessment would be complete on or before January 31, 2008, the reassessment and related accountants’ review have not yet been completed. Franklin stated on February 5, 2008, that it expects that it will complete the reassessment in time to file its 2007 third quarter Form 10-Q on or before March 31, 2008. Franklin also stated on February 5, 2008, that it expects to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, on or before March 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, following the troubled debt restructuring of our loans to Franklin, we had $1.2 billion of loans to Franklin, net of the amounts charged-off. For further discussion concerning our exposure to Franklin, see the “Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance and Comparisons” section included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.   If we were to assume the assets of Franklin, it is possible that we would report higher levels of non-performing loans and charge-offs and while we could report higher levels of interest income from these loans, lower levels of earnings than currently expected could result. If Franklin’s financial or operating condition were to deteriorate, we have established alternatives for loan servicing so that we should not be materially impacted if Franklin were unable to service loans. In the event of default by Franklin, we can terminate servicing responsibilities and appoint a successor servicer. Franklin would be contractually obligated to cooperate with us and incur the costs of transferring all documents, files, and balances to the successor. Franklin’s recent actions have not resulted in an event of default under any of its agreements with us.  We do not control Franklin, and Franklin’s ability to collect payments of principal and interest on its loans and other recoveries from its real estate assets depends upon the efforts of its own employees and third-party servicers hired by it. Franklin, like other residential mortgage lenders, is likely to be affected by the declines in home prices and disruptions in credit markets in many locales across the United States.  Our commercial real estate loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the on-going correction in residential real estate prices and reduced levels of home sales.   At December 31, 2007, we had $9.2 billion of commercial real estate loans, including $1.5 billion of loans to builders of single family homes. There has been a general slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold, particularly impacting borrowers in our eastern Michigan and northern Ohio markets. As a result, home builders have shown signs of financial deterioration. We expect the home builder market to continue to be volatile and anticipate continued pressure on the home builder segment in the coming months. As we continue our on-going portfolio monitoring, we will make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of the borrower or project combined with our expectations for the future. If the slow down in the housing market continues, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies in this portfolio. Declines in home values and reduced levels of home sales in our markets could continue to adversely affect us.   Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn. There has been a slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold, particularly in the eastern Michigan and northern Ohio markets. These developments have had, and further declines may continue to have, a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2007, we had:       •   $7.3 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing 18% of total loans and leases.        •   $5.4 billion in residential real estate loans, representing 14% of total loans and leases. Adjustable-rate mortgages, primarily mortgages that have a fixed rate for the first 3 to 5 years and then adjust annually, comprised 61% of this portfolio.         •   $1.5 billion of loans to single family home builders, including loans made to both middle market and small business home builders. These loans represented 4% of total loans and leases.        •   $1.2 billion of loans to Franklin, net of amounts charged-off, substantially all of which is secured by and ultimately reflects exposures to residential real estate loans. These loans represented 3% of total loans and leases.         •   $2.9 billion of mortgage-backed securities, including $1.6 billion of Federal Agency mortgage-backed securities and $0.8 billion of private label collateralized mortgage obligations with a weighted-average credit rating of AAA, that could be negatively affected by a decline in home values.     Continuing declines in home values are likely to lead to higher charge-offs and delinquencies in each of these portfolios as compared to the pre-July 2007 historical levels. The allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures.   Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  11    Table of Contents  (2) Market Risks:  Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.   Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and direct financing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.   Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities, and other assets, including retained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights. A portion of our earnings results from transactional income. An example of this type of transactional income is gain on sales of loans and other real estate owned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. For further discussion, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.   Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable nor controllable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest rate sensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies and operating limits. For further discussion, see the Market Risk — “Interest Rate Risk” section included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.  (3) Liquidity Risks:  If the Bank or holding company were unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or the operating cash needs to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.   Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Bank’s MRC regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. MRC also establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Bank’s wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and medium- and long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio (FHLB), which provides funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.    We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-core deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank also can borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window.  12    Table of Contents   If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet customers’ needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. For further discussion, see the “Liquidity Risk” section included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.   If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be negatively impacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted. The Bank has issued letters of credit that support $812 million of notes and bonds issued by our customers. The majority of the bonds have been sold by The Huntington Investment Company, our broker-dealer subsidiary. A downgrade in the Bank’s short term rating might influence some of the bond investors to put the bonds back to the remarketing agent. A failure to remarket would require the Bank to obtain funding for the amount of notes and bonds that cannot be remarketed.   As a result of credit deterioration related to our lending relationship with Franklin, and our related 2007 fourth quarter restructuring of that lending relationship, each of Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) changed their outlook for our ratings from stable to negative, Moody’s placed all ratings on review for possible downgrade, and Fitch downgraded our ratings on our senior unsecured notes and subordinated notes by one grade. That downgrade, and potential future downgrades in our credit ratings, whether relating to credit concerns, including our Franklin exposure, or other considerations, could limit our access to the capital markets, will increase the cost of our debt, and could adversely affect our liquidity and financial position.   Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of our liquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, but also the cost of these funds.   Credit ratings as of December 31, 2007, for the parent company and the Bank can be found in Table 31, included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.   We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits, federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied to credit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes in credit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger a requirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstanding borrowings. Credit rating downgrades could result in a loss of equity investor confidence.  The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which could impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Due to the significant loss that the Bank incurred in the fourth quarter of 2007, at December 31, 2007, the Bank could not declare and pay dividends to the holding company without regulatory approval.   The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and their respective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activities of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has the authority by statute to restrict the Bank’s ability to transfer assets, make shareholder distributions, and redeem preferred securities.   Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out of current or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount of capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certain amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the OCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with its net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred securities.  13    Table of Contents   We do not anticipate that the holding company will receive dividends from the Bank until the second half of 2008. We anticipate increasing the holding company’s liquidity by raising additional funds in early 2008.   Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank became “under-capitalized” for purposes of the OCC “prompt corrective action” regulations. “Under-capitalized” is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio of less than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it could impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2007, the Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be “well-capitalized.”   For further discussion, see the “Parent Company Liquidity” section included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.  (4) Operational Risks:  The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations for a particular period.   Huntington faces legal risks in its businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Huntington could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Huntington, which in turn could seriously harm Huntington’s business prospects. As more fully described in Item 3 of this Form 10-K, three putative class actions and one shareholder derivative action were filed against Huntington, certain affiliated committees, and / or certain of its current or former officers and directors in December 2007 through February 2008 related to Huntington’s transactions with Franklin and the financial disclosures relating to such transactions and, in one case, Huntington stock being offered as an investment in a Huntington employee benefit plan. At this early stage, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse outcome, or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with these lawsuits. Although no assurance can be given, based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, and available insurance coverage, management believes that the eventual outcome of these claims against us will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular period.  Huntington faces significant operational risk.   Huntington is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from Huntington’s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect Huntington’s ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action.   We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.  14    Table of Contents     Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments
