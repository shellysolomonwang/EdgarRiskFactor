Item 1A: Risk Factors   We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2) market risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads, (3) liquidity risk, which is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to the Company such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and (4) operational risk, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks.   In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could materially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.  11    Table of Contents  (1) Credit Risks:  The allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures.   Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The largest single contributor to our net loss in the fourth quarter of 2008, and our reduced net income in 2008, was $438.0 million of provision expense relating to our credit relationship with Franklin Credit Management Corporation (Franklin). This charge represents our best estimate of the inherent loss within this credit relationship. However, there can be no assurance that we will not incur further losses relating to the Franklin relationship.   We have a significant loan relationship with Franklin. Franklin describes itself as a specialty consumer finance company primarily engaged in the servicing and resolution of performing, re-performing, and nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Franklin’s portfolio consists of loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate that generally fall outside the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and involve elevated credit risk as a result of the nature or absence of income documentation, limited credit histories, higher levels of consumer debt or past credit difficulties. Franklin purchased these loan portfolios at a discount to the unpaid principal balances and originated loans with interest rates and fees calculated to provide a rate of return adjusted to reflect the elevated credit risk inherent in these types of loans. Franklin originated non-prime loans through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tribeca Lending Corp., and has generally held for investment the loans acquired and a significant portion of the loans originated.   Through the 2008 third quarter, the Franklin relationship continued to perform and accrue interest. While the cash flow generated by the underlying collateral declined slightly, it continued to exceed the requirements of the restructuring agreement. However, during the 2008 fourth quarter the cash flows deteriorated significantly, reflecting a more severe than expected deterioration in the overall economy. Principal payments associated with the first mortgage portfolios contracted significantly as the availability of credit was further reduced. An important source of principal reductions had been proceeds from the sale of properties in foreclosure, so the tightening of credit standards had a direct negative impact on the cash flows during the quarter. In addition, interest collections declined in the Franklin second mortgage portfolio as delinquencies continued to increase. These factors, coupled with the significant economic downturn in the 2008 fourth quarter, further weakened Franklin’s borrowers’ ability to pay, which resulted in significant deterioration in the cash flow that we expected to receive from these loans. As such, the changes in our estimates of the future expected cash flows led to the following 2008 fourth quarter actions:       •   $423.3 million of our loans to Franklin were charged-off,        •   $9.0 million of interest income was reversed as the remaining loans were put on nonaccrual,        •   $7.3 million of interest swap exposure was written off, and        •   $438.0 million of provision expense was recorded to replenish and increase the remaining specific loan loss reserve.     As a result of these actions, at December 31, 2008, total loans outstanding to Franklin were $650.2 million, down $444.3 million, or 41%, from $1.095 billion at September 30, 2008. The specific allowance for loan losses on the Franklin exposure at December 31, 2008, was $130.0 million, up from $115.3 million at September 30, 2008, and represented 20% of the remaining loans outstanding. Subtracting the specific reserve from total loans outstanding, our total net exposure to Franklin at December 31, 2008, was $520.2 million.   For further discussion concerning our exposure to Franklin, see the “Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance and Comparisons” section included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.  12    Table of Contents   If Franklin’s financial or operating condition were to deteriorate further, we have established alternatives for loan servicing. In the event of default by Franklin, we can terminate servicing responsibilities and appoint a successor servicer. Franklin would be contractually obligated to cooperate with us and incur the costs of transferring all documents, files, and balances to the successor.   We do not control Franklin, and Franklin’s ability to collect payments of principal and interest on its loans and other recoveries from its real estate assets depends upon the efforts of its own employees and third-party servicers hired by it. Franklin, like other residential mortgage lenders, is likely to be materially adversely affected by further declines in home prices and disruptions in credit markets in many locales across the United States.  A sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the markets in which we do business could adversely affect our business and operating results.   Our business could be adversely affected to the extent that weaknesses in business and economic conditions have direct or indirect impacts on us or on our customers and counterparties. These conditions could lead, for example, to one or more of the following:       •   A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;        •   A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and        •   An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.     An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent, indirectly, on industrial businesses and thus particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in these regions.  Our commercial real estate loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the on-going correction in residential real estate prices and reduced levels of home sales.   At December 31, 2008, we had $10.1 billion of commercial real estate loans, including $1.6 billion of loans to builders of single family homes. There continues to be a general slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold. As a result, home builders have shown signs of financial deterioration. We expect the home builder market to continue to be volatile and anticipate continued pressure on the home builder segment in the coming months. As we continue our on-going portfolio monitoring, we will make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of the borrower or project combined with our expectations for the future. If the slow down in the housing market continues, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies in this portfolio.  Declines in home values and reduced levels of home sales in our markets could continue to adversely affect us.   Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn. There has been a slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold. These developments have had, and further declines may continue to have, a negative effect on our financial conditions and results of operations. At December 31, 2008, we had:       •   $7.6 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing 18% of total loans and leases.        •   $4.8 billion in residential real estate loans, representing 12% of total loans and leases. Adjustable-rate mortgages, primarily mortgages that have a fixed rate for the first 3 to 5 years and then adjust annually, comprised 63% of this portfolio.        •   $1.6 billion of loans to single family home builders, including loans made to both middle market and small business home builders. These loans represented 4% of total loans and leases.        •   $0.7 billion of loans to Franklin, net of amounts charged-off, substantially all of which is secured by and ultimately reflects exposures to residential real estate loans. These loans represented 2% of total loans and leases.    13    Table of Contents      •   $2.1 billion of mortgage-backed securities, including $1.6 billion of Federal Agency mortgage-backed securities, $0.5 billion of private label collateralized mortgage obligations, $0.3 billion of Alt-A mortgage backed securities, and $0.1 billion of pooled trust preferred securities that could be negatively affected by a decline in home values.    Adverse economic conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related service industries may impact our banking business.   Many of the banking markets we serve are dependent, directly or indirectly, on the automobile manufacturing industry. We do not have any direct credit exposure to automobile manufacturers. However, we do have $288 million of exposure to companies that derive more than 25% of their revenues from contracts with the automobile manufacturing companies. Also, these automobile manufacturers or their suppliers employ many of our consumer customers. The automobile manufacturing industry has experienced significant economic difficulties over the past five years, which, in turn, has adversely impacted a number of related industries that serve the automobile manufacturing industry, including automobile parts suppliers and other indirect businesses. We cannot provide assurance that the economic conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related service industries will improve at any time in the foreseeable future or that adverse economic conditions in these industries will not impact the Bank.  We could experience losses on residual values related to our automobile lease portfolio.   Inherently, automobile lease portfolios are subject to residual risk, which arises when the market price of the leased vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the estimated residual value at the time the lease is originated. This situation arises due to a decline in used car market values. A reduction in the expected proceeds from the residual values of our direct financing leases would result in an immediate recognition of impairment on the lease whereas a reduction in the expected proceeds from the residual values of our operating leases would result in an increase in the depreciation of our operating lease assets over the remaining term of the lease. For further discussion about our management of lease residual risk, see the “Lease Residual Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.  (2) Market Risks:  If our stock price declines from levels at December 31, 2008, we will evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment, and if the values of our businesses have declined, we could recognize an impairment charge for our goodwill.   We performed interim evaluations of our goodwill balances at June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2008, and an annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1, 2008. Based on our analyses, we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the fair value of our assets and liabilities and, therefore, goodwill was not considered impaired at any of those dates. The valuation of each of these lines of business included determining the value of the assets and liabilities we currently own, as well as an estimate of the future earnings that we expect from each line of business. To validate our evaluation of the values of our businesses, we reconcile the aggregate values of our lines of business to our total market capitalization, allowing for an appropriate control premium, typically in a range of 20% to 50%. The estimated control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years. It is possible that our assumptions and conclusions regarding the valuation of our lines of business could change adversely, which could result in the recognition of impairment for our goodwill, which could have a material effect on our financial position and future results of operations.  The value of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines or other-than-temporary impairments could materially adversely affect our future earnings and regulatory capital.   Continued volatility in the market value for certain of our investment securities, whether caused by changes in market perceptions of credit risk, as reflected in the expected market yield of the security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could result in significant fluctuations in the value of the securities. This could have a material adverse impact on our accumulated other comprehensive loss and shareholders’ equity depending on the direction of the fluctuations. Furthermore, future downgrades or defaults in these securities could result in future classifications as other than temporarily impaired. This could have a material impact on our future earnings, although the impact on shareholders’ equity will be offset by any amount already included in other comprehensive income for securities where we have recorded temporary impairment.  14    Table of Contents  Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.   Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and direct financing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.   Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities, and other assets, including retained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights and assets under management. A portion of our earnings results from transactional income. Examples of transactional income include trust income, brokerage income, gain on sales of loans and other real estate owned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we decide to stop accruing interest on a loan, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of loans on nonaccrual status could have an adverse impact on net interest income.   Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable nor controllable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest rate sensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies and operating limits. For further discussion, see the Market Risk — “Interest Rate Risk” section included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference. If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer-term interest rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest-earning assets would continue to reprice downward while our interest-bearing liability rates, especially customer deposit rates, could remain at current levels.  (3) Liquidity Risks:  If the Bank or holding company were unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.   Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Bank’s MRC regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. MRC also establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Bank’s wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and medium- and long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio (FHLB), which provides funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.   We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-core deposits, issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank also can borrow from the Federal Reserve’s discount window.  15    Table of Contents   Starting in the middle of 2007, there has been significant turmoil and volatility in worldwide financial markets which is, at present, ongoing. These conditions have resulted in a disruption in the liquidity of financial markets, and could directly impact us to the extent we need to access capital markets to raise funds to support our business and overall liquidity position. This situation could affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such funds. If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet customers’ needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring our outstanding securities, including our subordinated debt, trust preferred securities and preferred shares in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares. For further discussion, see the “Liquidity Risk” section included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.  If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be negatively impacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted. The Bank has issued letters of credit that support $500 million of notes and bonds issued by our customers. The majority of the bonds have been sold by The Huntington Investment Company, our broker-dealer subsidiary. A downgrade in the Bank’s short term rating might influence some of the bond investors to put the bonds back to the remarketing agent. A failure to remarket would require the Bank to obtain funding for the amount of notes and bonds that cannot be remarketed.   Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of our liquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, but also the cost of these funds. In addition, certain financial on- and off-balance sheet arrangements contain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs should a negative rating change occur. Letter of credit commitments for marketable securities, interest rate swap collateral agreements, and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit rating provisions.   Credit ratings as of February 13, 2009, for the parent company and the Bank can be found in Table 40 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.   We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits, federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied to credit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes in credit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger a requirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstanding borrowings. Credit rating downgrades could result in a loss of equity investor confidence.  The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which could impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Due to the significant loss that the Bank incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008, at December 31, 2008, the Bank could not declare and pay dividends to the holding company without regulatory approval.   The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and their respective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activities of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has the authority by statute to restrict the Bank’s ability to transfer assets, make shareholder distributions, and redeem preferred securities.   Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out of current or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount of capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certain amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the OCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with its net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred securities.  16    Table of Contents   We do not anticipate that the holding company will receive dividends from the Bank during 2009, as we build the Bank’s regulatory capital levels above our already “well-capitalized” level.   Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank became “under-capitalized” for purposes of the OCC “prompt corrective action” regulations. “Under-capitalized” is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio of less than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it could impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2008, the Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be “well-capitalized.”   For further discussion, see the “Parent Company Liquidity” section included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.  (4) Operational Risks:  If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could impact our ability to compete for new business, constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs, and increase the cost of our services.   Huntington and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of various State and Federal regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, SEC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, Huntington is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in the “Regulatory Matters” section. As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization. These actions could impact the organization in a variety of ways, including subjecting us to monetary fines, restricting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.  The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations for a particular period.   Huntington faces legal risks in its businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Huntington could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Huntington, which in turn could seriously harm Huntington’s business prospects. As more fully described in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference, three putative class actions and three shareholder derivative action were filed against Huntington, certain affiliated committees, and / or certain of its current or former officers and directors from December 2007 through February 2008 related to Huntington’s transactions with Franklin and the financial disclosures relating to such transactions and, in one case, Huntington stock being offered as an investment in a Huntington employee benefit plan. At this time, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse outcome, or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with these lawsuits. Although no assurance can be given, based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, and available insurance coverage, management believes that the eventual outcome of these claims against us will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular period.  17    Table of Contents  Huntington faces significant operational risk.   Huntington is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from Huntington’s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect Huntington’s ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action.   We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.  Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report its financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price.   Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Management continually seeks to improve these controls and procedures.   Management believes that our key internal controls over financial reporting are currently effective; however, such controls and procedures will be modified, supplemented, and changed from time to time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. While Management will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take immediate action to remediate any future perceived gaps, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of these controls and procedures on an on-going basis. Any failure to maintain in the future an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report its financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact its business and stock price.  18    Table of Contents     Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments
