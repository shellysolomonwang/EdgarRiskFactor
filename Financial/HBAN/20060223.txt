Item 1A: Risk Factors   Like other financial companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which is the risk that loan and lease customers or other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations, (2) market risk, which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation, (3) liquidity risk, which is the risk that the parent company and/or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet its operating needs, and (4) operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events.   In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could materially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.  9       (1) Credit Risks:  We extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and judgment. We manage the credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions, and an on-going process of assessment of the quality of the credit already extended. Our credit standards and on-going process of credit assessment might not protect us from significant credit losses.   We take credit risk by virtue of making loans and leases, purchasing non-governmental securities, extending loan commitments and letters of credit, and being counterparties to off-balance sheet financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.   Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize “in-market” lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. Our credit administration function employs risk management techniques to ensure that loans and leases adhere to corporate policy and problem loans and leases are promptly identified. These procedures provide us with the information necessary to implement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take proactive corrective actions.   For further discussion about our management of credit risk, see the “Credit Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.  Our loans, leases, and deposits are focused in five states and adverse economic conditions in those states, in particular, could negatively impact results from operations, cash flows, and financial condition.   Concentration of credit risk can also arise with respect to loans and leases when the borrowers are located in the same geographical region. Our customers with loan and/or deposit balances at December 31, 2005, were located predominantly in Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, Indiana, and Kentucky. Because of the concentration of loans, leases, and deposits in these states, in the event of adverse economic conditions in these states, we could experience more difficulty in attracting deposits and experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on our loans and leases than if the loans and leases were more geographically diversified. Adverse economic conditions and other factors, such as political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect these states, may reduce demand for credit or fee-based products and could negatively affect real estate and other collateral values, interest rate levels, and the availability of credit to refinance loans at or prior to maturity.  Declines in home values in our markets could adversely impact results from operations.   Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn, and in particular, a significant decline in home values in our markets could have a negative effect on results of operations. At December 31, 2005, we had $4.6 billion of consumer home equity loans and lines with a weighted average loan-to-value ratio for the portfolio of 80%. In addition, at December 31, 2005, we had $4.2 billion in residential real estate loans with a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 71%. A significant decline in home values could lead to higher charge-offs in event of default in both the consumer home equity loan and residential real estate loan portfolios.  (2) Market Risks:  Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.   Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and direct financing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.  10        Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, including retained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights, and our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. A portion of our earnings result from transactional income. An example of this type of transactional income is gain on sales of loans and other real estate owned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. For further discussion, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2005 Annual Report.   Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable nor controllable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest rate sensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies and operating limits. For further discussion, see the “Interest Rate Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.  We could experience losses on residual values related to our automobile lease portfolio.   Inherently, automobile lease portfolios are subject to residual risk, which arises when the market price of the leased vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the estimated residual value at the time the lease is originated. This situation arises due to a decline in used car market values. A reduction in the expected proceeds from the residual values of our direct financing leases would result in an immediate recognition of impairment on the lease whereas a reduction in the expected proceeds from the residual values of our operating leases would result in an increase in the depreciation of our operating lease assets over the remaining term of the lease. For further discussion about our management of lease residual risk, see the “Lease Residual Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.  (3) Liquidity Risks:  If we are unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or meet the operating cash needs to fund corporate expansion and other activities.   Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Bank’s MRC regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. MRC also establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Bank’s wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and medium- and long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is also a member of certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB), which provide funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.    We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-core deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank also can borrow through the Federal Reserve’s discount window.   If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet customers’ needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. For further discussion, see the “Liquidity Risk” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report. 11       If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be negatively impacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted.   Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of our liquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength, credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings, capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availability of a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, but also the cost of these funds. In addition, certain financial on- and off-balance sheet arrangements contain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs should a negative rating change occur. Letter of credit commitments for marketable securities, interest rate swap collateral agreements, and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit rating provisions.   Credit ratings as of December 31, 2005, for the parent company and the Bank can be found in Table 26 of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.   We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits, federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied to credit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes in credit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger a requirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstanding borrowings. Credit rating downgrades could result in a loss of equity investor confidence.  We have authorized the use of a substantial amount of our cash for the repurchase of our shares, and this use of funds may limit our ability to complete other transactions or to pursue other business initiatives.   In October 2005, our board of directors authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to 15 million shares. We expect to repurchase shares for cash as business conditions warrant. The full implementation of this repurchase program will use a significant portion of our capital reserves. This use of capital could limit future flexibility to complete acquisitions of businesses or technology, or other transactions, or make investments in research and development, new employee hiring, or other aspects of operations that might be in our best interests, or could require that we borrow money or issue additional equity securities for such purposes. Any incurrence of debt may not be on favorable terms and could result in our being subject to covenants or other contractual restrictions that limit the ability to take advantage of other opportunities that may arise. Any such incurrence of debt would likely increase our interest expense, and any issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of existing shareholders.  (4) Operational Risks:  We have significant competition in both attracting and retaining deposits and in originating loans and leases.   Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with other banks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies and brokerage firms. Competition could intensify in the future as a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from non-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and banking reform.  In the normal course of business, we process large volumes of transactions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of transactions. If systems of internal control should fail to work as expected, if systems are used in an unauthorized manner, or if employees subvert the system of internal controls, significant losses could result.   We process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.  12        We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur, including the effects of operational errors. Such losses are recorded as non-interest expense.   While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.  Our acquisitions may not receive the necessary approvals, meet income and/or cost saving expectation levels, or be integrated within time frames originally anticipated. We may encounter unforeseen difficulties, including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption in connection with acquisitions. Acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results.   The completion of any merger is dependent on, among other things, receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals, the timing of which cannot be predicted with precision or may not be received at all. Additionally, a merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, as a result of unexpected factors or events, and the anticipated cost savings of a merger may take longer to be realized or may not be entirely achieved. The integration of acquired businesses and operations, including systems conversions, may take longer than anticipated, may be more costly than anticipated and may have unanticipated adverse results relating to our existing businesses or the businesses acquired. Further, decisions to sell or close units or otherwise change the business mix may adversely impact combined results. Moreover, we may be unable to identify, negotiate, or finance future acquisitions successfully. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses.  An extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.   Our operations depend upon, among other things, our infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking or viruses, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of our control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. Our business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations.  13       New or changes in existing tax, accounting, and regulatory rules and interpretations could significantly impact strategic initiatives, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.   The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a financial company’s shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading “Regulatory Matters.” These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time.   In addition, we may be subject to actions of our regulators that are specific to us. For further discussion, see Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2005 Annual Report.   Events that may not have a direct impact on us, such as the bankruptcy of major U.S. companies, have resulted in legislators, regulators, and authoritative bodies, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and various taxing authorities responding by adopting and/or proposing substantive revisions to laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations. International capital standards developed in the framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may also affect the competitive environment for United States banks.   The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations, or changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations, or specific actions of regulators, may have a material impact on our business and results of operations; however, it is impossible to predict at this time the extent of any impact from these items.  Non-compliance with USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.   The USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. We have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations.  14       The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which would impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock.   The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and their respective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activities of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has the authority by statute to restrict the Bank’s ability to transfer assets, make shareholder distributions, and redeem preferred securities.   Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out of current or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividend on shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount of capital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certain amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the OCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with its net profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred securities.   Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank became “under-capitalized” for purposes of the OCC “prompt corrective action” regulations. “Under-capitalized” is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio of less than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it would impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2005, the Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be “well-capitalized.”   For further discussion, see the “Parent Company Liquidity” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.  The Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.   The Federal Reserve, which examines us and our non-bank subsidiaries, has a policy stating that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source of strength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it, and therefore may be required to borrow the funds. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company’s results of operations and cash flows.  If any of our Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) affiliates fail to qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to a higher consolidated effective tax rate.   Huntington Preferred Capital, Inc. (HPCI), Huntington Preferred Capital II, Inc. (HPC-II) and Huntington Capital Financing, LLC (HCF) operate as REITs for federal income tax purposes. HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF are consolidated holding company subsidiaries established to acquire, hold, and manage mortgage assets and other authorized investments to generate net income for distribution to their shareholders.  15        Qualification as a REIT involves application of specific provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating to various asset tests. A REIT must satisfy six asset tests quarterly: (1) 75% of the value of the REIT’s total assets must consist of real estate assets, cash and cash items, and government securities; (2) not more than 25% of the value of the REIT’s total assets may consist of securities, other than those includible under the 75% test; (3) not more than 5% of the value of its total assets may consist of securities of any one issuer, other than those securities includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (4) not more than 10% of the outstanding voting power of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (5) not more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; and (6) a REIT cannot own securities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries which comprise more than 20% of its total assets. At December 31, 2005, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF met all of the quarterly asset tests.  Also, a REIT must annually satisfy two gross income tests: (1) 75% of its gross income must be from qualifying income closely connected with real estate activities; and (2) 95% of its gross income must be derived from sources qualifying for the 75% test plus dividends, interest, and gains from the sale of securities. In addition, a REIT must distribute 90% of the REIT’s taxable income for the taxable year, excluding any net capital gains, to maintain its non-taxable status for federal income tax purposes. For 2005, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF had met all annual income and distribution tests.   If any of these REIT affiliates fail to meet any of the required provisions for REITs, they could no longer qualify as a REIT and the resulting tax consequences would increase our effective tax rate. We could be held responsible for environmental liabilities of properties acquired through foreclosure of loans secured by real estate.   In the event we foreclose on a defaulted commercial mortgage and/or residential mortgage loan to recover our investment, we may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the underlying real property, which could exceed the value of the real property. Although we exercise due diligence to discover potential environmental liabilities prior to acquiring any property through foreclosure, hazardous substances or wastes, contaminants, pollutants, or their sources may be discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. There can be no assurance that we would not incur full recourse liability for the entire cost of any removal and clean-up on an acquired property, that the cost of removal and clean-up would not exceed the value of the property, or that we could recover any of the costs from any third party.  We have a pending formal supervisory agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.   On March 1, 2005, we announced entering into a formal written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) providing for a comprehensive action plan designed to enhance our corporate governance, internal audit, risk management, accounting policies and procedures, and financial and regulatory reporting. The agreement called for independent third-party reviews, as well as the submission of written plans and progress reports by Management and remains in effect until terminated by the banking regulators.   We were verbally advised that we were in full compliance with the financial holding company and financial subsidiary requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act). This notification reflects that we and the Bank meet both the “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” criteria under the GLB Act. We believe that the changes we have already made, and are in the process of making, will address the FRBC issues fully and comprehensively.  16       Item 1B: Unresolved Staff Comments
