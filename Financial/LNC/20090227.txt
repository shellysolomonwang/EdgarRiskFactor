Item 1A. Risk Factors” and in the “Forward-Looking Statements — Cautionary Language” in “Part II — Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (“MD&A”) of the Form 10-K. Our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) are presented in “Part II — Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”     Item 1. Business     OVERVIEW  Lincoln National Corporation (“LNC,” which also may be referred to as “Lincoln,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a holding company, which operates multiple insurance and investment management businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include institutional and/or retail fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance (“UL”), variable universal life insurance (“VUL”), term life insurance, mutual funds and managed accounts. LNC was organized under the laws of the state of Indiana in 1968. We currently maintain our principal executive offices in Radnor, Pennsylvania, which were previously located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “Lincoln Financial Group” is the marketing name for LNC and its subsidiary companies. As of December 31, 2008, LNC had consolidated assets of $163.1 billion and consolidated stockholders’ equity of $8.0 billion.  Prior to our realignment discussed below, we provided products and services in four operating businesses: Individual Markets; Employer Markets; Investment Management; and Lincoln UK. We reported results through six business segments: Individual Markets — Annuities; Individual Markets - Life Insurance; Employer Markets — Retirement Products; Employer Markets — Group Protection; Investment Management; and Lincoln UK.  On July 21, 2008, we announced the realignment of our segments under our former Employer Markets and Individual Markets operating businesses into two new operating businesses — Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions. We believe the new structure more closely aligns with consumer needs and should lead to more coordinated product development and greater effectiveness across the enterprise. The only change to our prior segment reporting was to report the results of the Executive Benefits business, which was previously part of the Retirement Products segment, in the Life Insurance segment for all periods presented. These changes are in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,” and reflect the manner in which we are organized for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. We view the changes to the existing segments as immaterial. Accordingly, we provide products and services in four operating businesses and report results through six segments as follows:             Business   Corresponding Segments     Retirement Solutions    Annuities       Defined Contribution (formerly Retirement Products)           Insurance Solutions    Life Insurance (including Executive Benefits business)       Group Protection           Investment Management    Investment Management           Lincoln UK    Lincoln UK    In addition, the results of our run-off Institutional Pension business, formerly reported in Employer Markets — Retirement Products — Executive Benefits, are included in Other Operations for all periods presented. Other Operations also includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments, unallocated corporate items and the ongoing amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity reinsurance portion of the sale of our former reinsurance segment to Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in the fourth quarter of 2001. Unallocated corporate items include investment income on investments related to the amount of statutory surplus in our insurance subsidiaries that is not allocated to our business units and other corporate investments, interest expense on short-term and long-term borrowings and certain expenses, including restructuring and merger-related expenses.   1    Table of Contents  On November 12, 2007, we signed agreements to sell the television stations, sports programming business and certain radio properties of our former Lincoln Financial Media segment. The sales closed during the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008. Accordingly, we have reported the results of these businesses as discontinued operations on our Consolidated Statements of Income and the assets and liabilities as held for sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. The results of the remaining radio properties, which are included in Other Operations, do not qualify as discontinued operations. For further information, see “Acquisitions and Dispositions” below.  The results of Lincoln Financial Network (“LFN”) and Lincoln Financial Distributors (“LFD”), our retail and wholesale distributors, respectively, are included in the segments for which they distribute products. LFD distributes our individual as well as Defined Contribution and Executive Benefits (which includes corporate-owned UL and VUL (“COLI”) and bank-owned UL and VUL (“BOLI”)) products and services. The distribution occurs primarily through brokers, planners, agents, financial advisors, third party administrators (“TPAs”) and other intermediaries. Group Protection distributes its products and services primarily through employee benefit brokers, TPAs and other employee benefit firms. As of December 31, 2008, LFD had approximately 830 internal and external wholesalers (including sales managers). As of December 31, 2008, LFN offered LNC and non-proprietary products and advisory services through a national network of approximately 7,400 active producers who placed business with us within the last twelve months.  On July 16, 2008, we announced our change in definitions of segment operating revenues and income from operations to better reflect the underlying economics of our variable and indexed annuities that employ derivative instruments to hedge policy benefits and the manner in which management evaluates that business. For more information regarding this change, see the “MD&A” below.  Financial information in the tables that follow is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. We provide revenues, income (loss) from operations and assets attributable to each of our business segments and Other Operations, as well as revenues derived inside and outside the U.S. for the last three fiscal years, in Note 23.  Revenues by segment (in millions) were as follows:                                     For the Years Ended December 31,         2008     2007     2006       Revenues                           Operating revenues:                           Retirement Solutions:                           Annuities   $ 2,610     $ 2,533     $ 2,060     Defined Contribution     936       986       988                           Total Retirement Solutions     3,546       3,519       3,048                           Insurance Solutions:                           Life Insurance     4,250       4,189       3,470     Group Protection     1,640       1,500       1,032                           Total Insurance Solutions     5,890       5,689       4,502                           Investment Management     438       590       564     Lincoln UK     327       370       308     Other Operations     439       473       444     Excluded realized gain (loss), pre-tax     (760 )     (175 )     12     Amortization of deferred gain arising from reserve changes on business sold through reinsurance, pre-tax     3       9       1                           Total revenues   $ 9,883     $ 10,475     $ 8,879                             2    Table of Contents  Acquisitions and Dispositions  On January 8, 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision approved our application to become a savings and loan holding company and our acquisition of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, a federally regulated savings bank, located in Indiana. We agreed to contribute $10 million to the capital of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB. We closed on our purchase of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB on January 15, 2009. We also filed an application with the U.S. Treasury to participate in the Troubled Assets Relief Program (“TARP”) Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”). We have also applied to participate in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the “TLGP”). Our applications to participate in the CPP and the TLGP are subject to approval from the U.S. Treasury and FDIC, respectively. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will participate in the CPP or the TLGP. These programs are discussed further below in “Regulatory.”  On November 12, 2007, Lincoln Financial Media Company (“LFMC”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into two stock purchase agreements with Raycom Holdings, LLC (“Raycom”). Pursuant to one of the agreements, LFMC agreed to sell to Raycom all of the outstanding capital stock of three of LFMC’s wholly-owned subsidiaries: WBTV, Inc., the owner and operator of television station WBTV, Charlotte, North Carolina; WCSC, Inc., the owner and operator of television station WCSC, Charleston, South Carolina; and WWBT, Inc., the owner and operator of television station WWBT, Richmond, Virginia. The transaction closed on March 31, 2008, and LFMC received proceeds of $546 million. Pursuant to the other agreement, LFMC agreed to sell to Raycom all of the outstanding capital stock of Lincoln Financial Sports, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of LFMC. This transaction closed on November 30, 2007, and LFMC received $42 million of proceeds.  On November 12, 2007, LFMC also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Greater Media, Inc., to sell all of the outstanding capital stock of Lincoln Financial Media Company of North Carolina, the owner and operator of radio stations WBT(AM), Charlotte, North Carolina; WBT-FM, Chester, South Carolina; and WLNK(FM), Charlotte, North Carolina. This transaction closed on January 31, 2008, and LFMC received proceeds of $100 million. More information on these LFMC transactions can be found in our Form 8-K filed on November 14, 2007, and in Note 3.  During the fourth quarter of 2007, we sold certain institutional taxable fixed income business to an unaffiliated investment management company. Investment Management transferred $12.3 billion of assets under management as part of this transaction. Based upon the assets transferred as of October 31, 2007, the purchase price is expected to be approximately $49 million. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we received $25 million of the purchase price, with additional scheduled payments over the next three years. During 2007, we recorded an after-tax loss of $2 million in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Income as a result of the goodwill we attributed to this business. During 2008, we recorded an after-tax gain of $5 million in realized gain (loss) on our Consolidated Statements of Income related to this transaction, for additional cash received toward the purchase price. Investment Management manages approximately $90.7 billion of fixed income assets with a team of 100 fixed income investment professionals. The transaction did not impact the fixed income team that manages our fixed income mutual funds or general account assets.  On April 3, 2006, we completed our merger with Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (“Jefferson-Pilot”), pursuant to which Jefferson-Pilot merged into one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Prior to the merger, Jefferson-Pilot, through its subsidiaries, offered full lines of individual life, annuity and investment products, and group life insurance products, disability income and dental contracts, and it operated television and radio stations and a sports broadcasting network.  In September 2004, we completed the sale of our London-based international investment unit, Delaware International Advisors Ltd. (“DIAL”), to a newly-formed company associated with DIAL’s management and a private-equity firm. At closing, we received $181 million in cash and relief of certain obligations of approximately $19 million. We had an after-tax gain from the transaction of $46 million. DIAL, which has since been renamed Mondrian Investment Partners (“Mondrian”), continues to provide sub-advisory services with respect to certain international asset classes for our Investment Management segment and LNC.  For further information about acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 3.     BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND OTHER OPERATIONS     RETIREMENT SOLUTIONS  Overview  The Retirement Solutions business, with principal operations in Radnor, Pennsylvania; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Hartford, Connecticut; and Greensboro, North Carolina and additional operations in Concord, New Hampshire and Arlington Heights, Illinois, provides its products through two segments: Annuities and Defined Contribution. The Annuities segment provides tax-deferred growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed annuities, and variable annuities. The Defined Contribution segment provides employer-sponsored fixed and variable annuities and mutual fund-based programs in the 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plan marketplaces. Products for both segments are distributed through a wide range of intermediaries including both affiliated and unaffiliated channels including advisors, consultants, brokers, banks and wirehouses.   3    Table of Contents     Retirement Solutions — Annuities  Overview  The Annuities segment provides tax-deferred growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering fixed and variable annuities. As a result of a broad product portfolio and a strong and diverse distribution network, Annuities ranked 5th in assets and 5th in variable annuity flows for the year ended December 31, 2008, in the U.S., according to Morningstar Annuity Research Center.  The Annuities segment offers non-qualified and qualified fixed and variable annuities to individuals. The “fixed” and “variable” classification describes whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the contract. This also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products, either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable products.  Annuities have several features that are attractive to customers. First, they provide tax-deferred growth in the underlying principal, thereby deferring the tax consequences of the growth in value until withdrawals are made from the accumulation values, often at lower tax rates occurring during retirement. Second, annuities are unique in that contract holders can select a variety of payout alternatives to help provide an income flow for life. Many annuity contracts include guarantee features (living and death benefits) that are not found in any other investment vehicle and, we believe, make annuities attractive especially in times of economic uncertainty. Over the last several years, the individual annuities market has seen an increase in competition with respect to guarantee features.  Products  In general, an annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual or group in which the insurance company, after receipt of one or more premium payments, agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on a periodic basis (i.e. annually, semi-annually, quarterly or monthly), beginning on a certain date and continuing for a period of time as specified in the contract. Periodic payments can begin within twelve months after the premium is received (referred to as an immediate annuity) or at a future date in time (referred to as a deferred annuity). This retirement vehicle helps protect an individual from outliving his or her money and can be either a fixed annuity or a variable annuity.  The Annuities segment’s deposits (in millions) were as follows:                                     For the Years Ended December 31,         2008     2007     2006       Deposits                           Variable portion of variable annuity   $ 6,690     $ 9,135     $ 7,251     Fixed portion of variable annuity     3,433       2,795       2,090                           Total variable annuity     10,123       11,930       9,341     Fixed indexed annuity     1,078       755       717     Other fixed annuity     529       772       698                           Total deposits   $ 11,730     $ 13,457     $ 10,756                            Variable Annuities  A variable annuity provides the contract holder the ability to direct the investment of premium deposits into one or more sub-accounts offered through the product (“variable portion”) or into a fixed account with a guaranteed return (“fixed portion”). The value of the variable portion of the contract holder’s account varies with the performance of the underlying sub-accounts chosen by the contract holder. The underlying assets of the sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance series of mutual funds. The contract holder’s return is tied to the performance of the segregated assets underlying the variable annuity (i.e. the contract holder bears the investment risk associated with these investments). The value of the fixed portion is guaranteed by us and recorded in our general account liabilities. Variable annuity account values were $44.5 billion, $62.1 billion and $51.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, including the fixed portions of variable accounts of $3.6 billion, $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  We charge mortality and expense assessments and administrative fees on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are built into accumulation unit values, which when multiplied by the number of units owned for any sub-account equals the contract holder’s account value for that sub-account. The fees that we earn from these contracts are reported as insurance fees on our Consolidated Statements of Income. In addition, for some contracts, we collect surrender charges that range from 0% to 10% of withdrawals when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge period, which is generally higher during the early years of a contract. Our individual variable annuity products have a maximum surrender charge period of ten years.   4    Table of Contents  We offer A-share, B-share, C-share, L-share and bonus variable annuities, although not with every annuity product. The differences in these relate to the sales charge and fee structure associated with the contract.     •   An A-share has a front-end sales charge and no back-end contingent deferred sales charge, also known as a surrender charge. The net premium (premium less front-end charge) is invested in the contract, resulting in full liquidity and lower mortality and expense assessments over the long term than those in other share classes.       •   A B-share has a seven-year surrender charge that is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract’s specified surrender charge period. The entire premium is invested in the contract, but it offers limited liquidity during the surrender charge period.       •   A C-share has no front-end sales charge or back-end surrender charge. Accordingly, it offers maximum liquidity but mortality and expense assessments are higher than those for A-share or B-share during the surrender charge period. A persistency credit is applied beginning in year eight so that the total charge to the customer is consistent with B-share levels.       •   An L-share has a four to five year surrender charge that is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract’s specified surrender charge period. The differences between the L-share and the B-share are the length of the surrender charge period and the fee structure. L-shares have a shorter surrender charge period, so for the added liquidity, mortality and expense assessments are higher. We offer L-share annuity products with persistency credits that are applied in all years after surrender charges are no longer applicable so that the total charge to the customer is consistent with B-share levels.       •   A bonus annuity is a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus credit to a contract based on a specified percentage (typically ranging from 2% to 5%) of each deposit. The entire premium plus the bonus are invested in the sub-accounts supporting the contract. It has a seven to nine-year surrender charge. The expenses are slightly more than those for a B-share. We offer bonus annuity products with persistency credits that are applied in all years after surrender charges are no longer applicable so that the total charge to the customer is consistent with B-share levels.    We offer guaranteed benefit riders with certain of our variable annuity products, such as a guaranteed death benefit (“GDB”), a guaranteed withdrawal benefit (“GWB”), a guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) and a combination of such benefits. Most of our variable annuity products also offer the choice of a fixed option that provides for guaranteed interest credited to the account value.  Approximately 91% of variable annuity separate account values had a GDB rider as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The GDB features currently offered include those where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder that upon death, we will return no less than: the total deposits made to the contract, adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals; the total deposits made to the contract, adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals, plus a minimum return; or the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals following the contract anniversary.  Approximately 28%, 31% and 26% of variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, had a GWB rider. The Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage benefit is a GWB rider that offers the contract holder a guarantee equal to the initial deposit (or contract value, if elected after issue), adjusted for any subsequent purchase payments or withdrawals. There are two elective step-up options: a one-year option and a five-year option. In general, the one-year option allows an owner to step up the guarantee amount automatically on the benefit anniversary to the current contract value, and the five-year option allows the owner to step up the guarantee amount to the current contract value on or after the fifth anniversary of the election or of the most recent step up. In each case, the contract value must be greater than the guarantee amount at the time of step up. To receive the full amount of the guarantee, annual withdrawals are limited to either 5% of the guaranteed amount for the one-year option or 7% of the guaranteed amount for the five-year option. Under the one-year option, withdrawals will continue for the rest of the owner’s life (“single life version”) or the life of the owner or owner’s spouse (“joint life version”) as long as withdrawals begin after attained age 65 and are limited to 5% of the guaranteed amount. Withdrawals in excess of the applicable maximum in any contract year are assessed any applicable surrender charges, and the guaranteed amount is recalculated.  We offer other product riders including i4LIFE® Advantage and 4LATER® Advantage. The i4LIFE® rider, on which we have received a U.S. patent, allows variable annuity contract holders access and control during the income distribution phase of their contract. This added flexibility allows the contract holder to access the account value for transfers, additional withdrawals and other service features like portfolio rebalancing. Approximately 11%, 9% and 6% of variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, have elected an i4LIFE® Advantage feature. In general, GIB is an optional feature available with i4LIFE® Advantage that guarantees regular income payments will not fall below 75% of the highest income payment on a specified anniversary date (reduced for any subsequent withdrawals). Approximately 92%, 88% and 83% of i4LIFE® Advantage account values elected the GIB feature as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 4LATER® Advantage provides a minimum income base used to determine the GIB floor when a client begins income payments under i4LIFE® Advantage. The income base is equal to the initial deposit (or contract value, if elected after issue) and increases by 15% every three years (subject to a 200% cap). The owner may step up the income base on or after the third anniversary of rider election or of the most recent step-up (which also resets the 200% cap).   5    Table of Contents  The Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage and Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage Plus are hybrid benefit riders combining aspects of GWB and GIB. Both benefit riders allow the contract holder the ability to take income at a maximum rate of 5% of the guaranteed amount when they are above the lifetime income age or income through i4LIFE® Advantage with the GIB. Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage and Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage Plus provide higher income if the contract holder delays withdrawals, including both a 5% enhancement to the guaranteed amount each year a withdrawal is not taken for a specified period of time and a doubling of the initial guaranteed amount at the later of ten years or age seventy, subject to withdrawal limits. The Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage Plus provides an additional benefit, which is a return of principal at the end of the seventh year if the customer has not taken any withdrawals. Contract holders under both the Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage and Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage Plus are subject to restrictions on the allocation of their account value within the various investment choices. Approximately 8% of variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2008, had a Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage or Lincoln Lifetime IncomeSM Advantage Plus rider.  To mitigate the increased risks associated with guaranteed benefits, we developed a dynamic hedging program. The customized dynamic hedging program uses equity and interest rate futures positions, interest rate and variance swaps, as well as equity-based options depending upon the risks underlying the guarantees. Our program is designed to offset both positive and negative changes in the carrying value of the guarantees. However, while we actively manage these hedge positions, the hedge positions may not be effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to, among other things, the time lag between changes in their values and corresponding changes in the hedge positions, high levels of volatility in the equity markets, contract holder behavior and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and hedging indices, which is referred to as basis risk. For more information on our hedging program, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Derivatives” and “Realized Gain (Loss)” in the MD&A. For information regarding risks related to guaranteed benefits, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affect the profitability of our products with guaranteed benefits; therefore, such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.”  We design and actively manage the features and structure of our guaranteed benefit riders to maintain a competitive suite of products consistent with profitability and risk management goals. In late 2008 and early 2009, in light of changes in the variable annuity market place driven by financial market conditions, we made changes to our rider designs that are expected to reduce the risk of these benefits. The changes include, but are not limited to, implementing investment restrictions for all new rider sales and for the majority of in force policies with guaranteed riders, raising the charge for guaranteed benefit riders and eliminating certain features. We plan to make further rider design changes in 2009 that we expect will reduce the risk of our guaranteed benefit riders. The changes will take into account the rapidly evolving competitive environment for guaranteed benefit annuities.  Fixed Annuities  A fixed annuity preserves the principal value of the contract while guaranteeing a minimum interest rate to be credited to the accumulation value. We offer single and flexible premium fixed deferred annuities to the individual annuities market. Single premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow only a single premium to be paid. Flexible premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow multiple premium payments on either a scheduled or non-scheduled basis. Our fixed annuities include both traditional fixed-rate and fixed indexed annuities. With fixed deferred annuities, the contract holder has the right to surrender the contract and receive the current accumulation value less any applicable surrender charge and, if applicable, a market value adjustment (“MVA”). Depending on market conditions, MVAs can, for some products, be less than zero, which means the MVA results in an increase to the amount received by the contract holder.  Fixed indexed annuities allow the contract holder to elect an interest rate linked to the performance of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index® (“S&P 500”). The indexed interest rate is guaranteed never to be less than zero. Our fixed indexed annuities provide contract holders a choice of a traditional fixed-rate account and one or more different indexed accounts. A contract holder may elect to change allocations at renewal dates, either annually or biannually. At each renewal date, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component (i.e. reset the caps, spreads or participation rates), subject to guarantees.  Fixed annuity contracts are general account obligations. We bear the investment risk for fixed annuity contracts. To protect from premature withdrawals, we impose surrender charges. Surrender charges are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, with a declining level of surrender charges over time. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts. In addition, with respect to fixed indexed annuities, we purchase options that are highly correlated to the indexed account allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are closely hedged with respect to indexed interest for the current reset period. For more information on our hedging program for fixed indexed annuities, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Derivatives” and “Realized Gain (Loss)” in the MD&A.   6    Table of Contents  Individual fixed annuity account values were $14.0 billion, $14.4 billion and $14.9 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Approximately $10.1 billion of individual fixed annuity account values as of December 31, 2008, were still within the surrender charge period.  Our fixed annuity product offerings as of December 31, 2008, consisted of traditional fixed-rate and fixed indexed deferred annuities, as well as fixed-rate immediate annuities with various payment options, including lifetime incomes. In addition to traditional fixed-rate immediate annuities, in 2007 we introduced Lincoln SmartIncomeSM Inflation Annuity. This product provides lifetime income with annual adjustments to keep pace with inflation. It uses a patent-pending design to preserve access to remaining principal, also adjusted annually for inflation, for premature death or unexpected needs. The traditional fixed-rate deferred annuity products include the Lincoln ClassicSM (Single and Flexible Premium), Lincoln SelectSM and Lincoln ChoicePlusSM Fixed annuities. The fixed indexed deferred annuity products include the Lincoln OptiPoint®, Lincoln OptiChoiceSM, Lincoln New Directions® and Lincoln Future Point® annuities. The fixed indexed annuities offer one or more of the following indexed accounts:     •   The Performance Triggered Indexed Account pays a specified rate, declared at the beginning of the indexed term, if the S&P 500 value at the end of the indexed term is the same or greater than the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the indexed term;       •   The Point to Point Indexed Account compares the value of the S&P 500 at the end of the indexed term to the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the term. If the S&P 500 at the end of the indexed term is higher than the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the term, then the percentage change, up to the declared indexed interest cap, is credited to the indexed account;       •   The Monthly Cap Indexed Account reflects the monthly changes in the S&P 500 value over the course of the indexed term. Each month, the percentage change in the S&P 500 value is calculated, subject to a monthly indexed cap that is declared at the beginning of the indexed term. At the end of the indexed term, all of the monthly change percentages are summed to determine the rate of indexed interest that will be credited to the account; and       •   The Monthly Average Indexed Account compares the average monthly value of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500 value at the beginning of the term. The average of the S&P 500 values at the end of each of the twelve months in the indexed term is calculated. The percentage change of the average S&P 500 value to the starting S&P 500 value is calculated. From that amount, the indexed interest spread, which is declared at the beginning of the indexed term, is subtracted. The resulting rate is used to calculate the indexed interest that will be credited to the account.    If the S&P 500 values produce a negative indexed interest rate, no indexed interest is credited to the indexed account.  We introduced the Lincoln Living IncomeSM Advantage in 2007. Available with certain of our fixed indexed annuities, it provides the contract holder a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit. Withdrawals in excess of the free amount are assessed any applicable surrender charges, and the guaranteed withdrawal amount is recalculated.  Many of our fixed annuities have an MVA. If a contract with an MVA is surrendered during the surrender charge period, both a surrender charge and an MVA may be applied. The MVA feature increases or decreases the contract value of the annuity based on a decrease or increase in interest rates. Individual fixed annuities with an MVA feature constituted 46%, 40% and 24% of total fixed annuity account values as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Distribution  The Annuities segment distributes its individual fixed and variable annuity products through LFD, our wholesaling distribution organization. LFD’s distribution channels give the Annuities segment access to its target markets. LFD distributes the segment’s products to a large number of financial intermediaries, including LFN. The financial intermediaries include wire/regional firms, independent financial planners, financial institutions and managing general agents.  Competition  The annuities market is very competitive and consists of many companies — with no one company dominating the market for all products. The Annuities segment competes with numerous other financial services companies. The main factors upon which entities in this market compete are distribution channel access and the quality of wholesalers, investment performance, cost, product features, speed to market, brand recognition, financial strength ratings, crediting rates and client service.   7    Table of Contents     Retirement Solutions — Defined Contribution  Overview  The Defined Contribution segment provides employers the ability to offer tax-deferred retirement savings plans to their employees, primarily through 403(b) and 401(k) retirement savings plans. We provide a variety of plan investment vehicles, including individual and group variable annuities, group fixed annuities and mutual funds. We also offer a broad array of plan services including plan recordkeeping, compliance testing, participant education and other related services.  Defined contribution (“DC”) plans are a popular employee benefit offered by many employers across a wide spectrum of industries and by employers large and small. Some plans include employer matching of contributions, which can increase participation by employees. Growth in the number of DC plans has occurred as these plans have been used as replacements for frozen or eliminated defined benefit retirement plans. In general, DC plans offer tax-deferred contributions and investment growth, thereby deferring the tax consequences of both the contributions and investment growth until withdrawals are made from the accumulated values, often at lower tax rates occurring during retirement.  Lincoln’s 403(b) assets accounted for 60% of total assets under management in this segment as of December 31, 2008. The 401(k) business accounted for 46% of our new deposits during 2008 for this segment.  Products and Services  The Defined Contribution segment currently offers four primary offerings to the employer-sponsored market: LINCOLN DIRECTORSM group variable annuity, LINCOLN ALLIANCE® program, Lincoln SmartFuture® program and Multi-Fund® variable annuity.  The Defined Contribution segment’s deposits (in millions) were as follows:                                     For the Years Ended December 31,         2008     2007     2006       Deposits                           Variable portion of variable annuity   $ 2,170     $ 2,355     $ 2,525     Fixed portion of variable annuity     369       351       441                           Total variable annuity     2,539       2,706       2,966     Fixed annuity     812       754       506     Mutual funds     2,196       2,090       1,113                           Total deposits   $ 5,547     $ 5,550     $ 4,585                            LINCOLN DIRECTORSM and Multi-Fund® products are variable annuities. LINCOLN ALLIANCE® and Lincoln SmartFuture® programs are mutual fund-based programs. This suite of products covers both the 403(b) and 401(k) marketplace. Both 403(b) and 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, defined contribution plans offered to employees of an entity to enable them to save for retirement. The 403(b) plans are available to employees of educational institutions, not-for-profit healthcare organizations and certain other not-for-profit entities, while 401(k) plans are generally available to employees of for-profit entities. The investment options for our annuities encompass the spectrum of asset classes with varying levels of risk and include both equity and fixed income. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, healthcare clients accounted for 45% and 43% of account values for these products, respectively.  LINCOLN DIRECTORSM group variable annuity is a 401(k) DC retirement plan solution available to micro- to small-sized businesses, typically those that have DC plans with less than $3 million in account values. The LINCOLN DIRECTORSM product offers participants a broad array of investment options from several fund families. In 2008, the investment options were significantly enhanced with the addition of the funds that had been offered only through the Lincoln American Legacy Retirement® group variable annuity. Lincoln American Legacy Retirement® was merged into LINCOLN DIRECTORSM group variable annuity in 2008 and is no longer offered as a standalone product for new sales. LINCOLN DIRECTORSM group variable annuity has the option of being serviced through a TPA or fully serviced by Lincoln. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 90% of LINCOLN DIRECTORSM clients were serviced through TPAs. The Defined Contribution segment earns revenue through asset charges, investment income, surrender charges and recordkeeping fees from this product. Account values for LINCOLN DIRECTORSM group variable annuity were $4.9 billion, $7.8 billion and $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Deposits for LINCOLN DIRECTORSM group variable annuity were $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   8    Table of Contents  The LINCOLN ALLIANCE® program is a 401(k) or 403(b) DC retirement plan solution aimed at mid to large employers, typically those that have DC plans with $15 million or more in account value. The target market is primarily for-profit corporations, educational institutions and healthcare providers. The program bundles our traditional fixed annuity products with the employer’s choice of retail mutual funds, along with recordkeeping, plan compliance services and customized employee education services. Included in the product offering is the LIFESPAN® learning program, which provides participants with educational materials and one-on-one guidance for retirement planning assistance. The program allows the use of any retail mutual fund. We earn fees for our recordkeeping and educational services and the services we provide to mutual fund accounts. We also earn investment margins on fixed annuities. The retail mutual funds associated with this program are not included in the separate accounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we do not have any ownership interest in them. LINCOLN ALLIANCE® program account values were $9.4 billion, $9.5 billion and $7.0 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  The Lincoln SmartFuture® program is a 401(k) or 403(b) DC retirement plan solution aimed at small to mid to large employers, typically those that have DC plans with between $3 million to $15 million or more in account value. The target market is primarily for-profit corporations, educational institutions and healthcare providers. The Lincoln SmartFuture® program was introduced in 2008 and is built on the LINCOLN ALLIANCE® platform. Like LINCOLN ALLIANCE®, the program bundles our traditional fixed annuity products with retail mutual funds, recordkeeping, plan compliance services and employee education services using the LIFESPAN® learning program, which is described further above. However, the Lincoln SmartFuture® program allows the employer to choose from a list of over 100 retail mutual funds chosen by us, which consists of a broad range of low-cost funds. Services for this program are typically not customized for each employer. We earn fees for our recordkeeping and educational services and the services we provide to mutual fund accounts. We also earn investment margins on fixed annuities. The retail mutual funds associated with this program are not included in the separate accounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we do not have any ownership interest in them. Lincoln SmartFuture® program account values were $104 million as of December 31, 2008.  Multi-Fund® Variable Annuity is a defined contribution retirement plan solution with full-bundled administrative services and high quality investment choices marketed to small- to mid-sized healthcare, education, governmental and not-for-profit plans. The product can be sold either to the employer through the Multi-Fund® group variable annuity contract or directly to the individual through the Multi-Fund® select variable annuity contract. Included in the product offering is the LIFESPAN® learning program, which is described further above. We earn mortality and expense charges, investment income and surrender charges from this product. The Multi-Fund® variable annuity is currently available in all states except New York. Account values for the Multi-Fund® variable annuity were $9.7 billion, $13.3 billion and $13.5 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Multi-Fund® program deposits represented 15%, 17% and 20% of the segment’s deposits in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Distribution  Defined contribution products are distributed by LFD, which has approximately 80 internal and external wholesalers (including sales managers). The wholesalers distribute the defined contribution products through advisors, consultants, banks, wirehouses, TPAs and individual planners. The Multi-Fund® program is sold primarily by affiliated advisors; certain non-affiliated advisors can also distribute the product. The LINCOLN ALLIANCE® program and the Lincoln SmartFuture® program are sold primarily through consultants and affiliated advisors. LINCOLN DIRECTORSM group variable annuity is sold primarily by TPAs and individual planners and is in the early stages of introduction to wirehouses and banks.  Competition  The defined contribution marketplace is very competitive and is comprised of many providers — with no one company dominating the market for all products. We compete with numerous other financial services companies. The main factors upon which entities in this market compete are distribution channel access and the quality of wholesalers, investment performance, cost, product features, speed to market, brand recognition, financial strength ratings, crediting rates and client service.     INSURANCE SOLUTIONS  Overview  The Insurance Solutions business provides its products through two segments: Life Insurance and Group Protection. The Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through both individual and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, as well as term insurance and the MoneyGuard® product, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs). The Group Protection segment focuses on offering group term life, disability income and dental insurance primarily in the small to mid-sized employer marketplace for their eligible employees.   9    Table of Contents     Insurance Solutions — Life Insurance  Overview  The Life Insurance segment, with principal operations in Greensboro, North Carolina and Hartford, Connecticut and additional operations in Concord, New Hampshire and Fort Wayne, Indiana, focuses on the creation and protection of wealth for its clients through the manufacturing of life insurance products. The Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a UL policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of UL and VUL, including COLI and BOLI products.   The Life Insurance segment primarily targets the affluent to high net worth markets, defined as households with at least $250,000 of financial assets. For those individual policies we sold in 2008, the average face amount (excluding term and MoneyGuard® products) was $1 million and average first year premiums paid were approximately $60,000.  The Life Insurance segment also offers COLI and BOLI products and services to small- to mid-sized banks and mid- to large-sized corporations, mostly through executive benefit brokers.  Products  The Life Insurance segment sells primarily interest/market-sensitive products (UL and VUL), including COLI and BOLI products, and term products. The segment’s sales (in millions) were as follows:                                     For the Years Ended December 31,         2008     2007     2006       Sales by Product                           UL:                           Excluding MoneyGuard®   $ 525     $ 597     $ 436     MoneyGuard ®     50       40       31                           Total UL     575       637       467     VUL     54       77       61     COLI and BOLI     84       91       83     Term/whole life     28       32       43                           Total sales   $ 741     $ 837     $ 654                            UL, VUL and COLI and BOLI sales represent target premium plus 5% of excess premium (including adjustments for internal replacements at 50%); whole life and term sales represent 100% of first year paid premium; and linked-benefit sales represent 15% of premium deposits.  The segment generally has higher sales in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. Approximately 46% and 41% of total sales were in the first half of 2008 and 2006, respectively; however, in 2007, approximately 50% of total sales were in the first half of the year. In 2007, this was due to the transition of our product portfolio to the new unified product portfolio.  In addition, the following table shows life policies’ face amount in force (in millions):                                     As of December 31,         2008     2007     2006       In-Force Face Amount                           UL and other   $ 310,198     $ 299,598     $ 282,874     Term insurance     235,023       235,919       234,148                           Total in-force face amount   $ 545,221     $ 535,517     $ 517,022                            Mortality margins, morbidity margins (for linked-benefit products), investment margins (through spreads or fees), net expense charges (expense charges assessed to the contract holder less expenses incurred to manage the business) and surrender fees drive life insurance profits. Mortality margins represent the difference between amounts charged to the customer to cover the mortality risk and the actual cost of reinsurance and death benefits paid. Mortality charges are either specifically deducted from the contract holder’s policy account value (i.e. cost of insurance assessments or “COIs”) or are embedded in the premiums charged to the customer. In either case, these amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and level of insurance in force (less reserves previously set aside to fund benefits). Insurance in force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency and mortality experience.   10    Table of Contents  Similar to the annuity product classifications described above, life products can be classified as “fixed” or “variable” contracts. This classification describes whether we or the policy holders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the policy. This also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products, either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable products.  We offer four categories of life insurance products consisting of:  Interest-sensitive Life Insurance (Primarily UL)  Interest-sensitive life insurance products provide life insurance with account (cash) values that earn rates of return based on company-declared interest rates. Contract holder account values are invested in our general account investment portfolio, so we bear the risk of investment performance. Some of our UL contracts include secondary guarantees, which are explained more fully below.  In a UL contract, contract holders have flexibility in the timing and amount of premium payments and the amount of death benefit, provided there is sufficient account value to cover all policy charges for mortality and expenses for the coming period. Under certain contract holder options and market conditions, the death benefit amount may increase or decrease. Premiums received on a UL product, net of expense loads and charges, are added to the contract holder’s account value. The client has access to their account value (or a portion thereof) through contractual liquidity features such as loans, partial withdrawals and full surrenders. Loans and withdrawals reduce the death benefit amount payable and are limited to certain contractual maximums (some of which are required under state law), and interest is charged on all loans. Our UL contracts assess surrender charges against the policies’ account values for full or partial face amount surrenders that occur during the contractual surrender charge period. Depending on the product selected, surrender charge periods can range from 0 to 20 years.   We also offer a fixed indexed UL product that functions similarly to a traditional UL policy, with the added flexibility of allowing contract holders to have portions of their account value earn interest credits linked to the performance of the S&P 500. The indexed interest rate is guaranteed never to be less than 1%. Our fixed indexed UL policy provides contract holders a choice of a traditional fixed rate account and several different indexed accounts. A contract holder may elect to change allocations annually for amounts in the indexed accounts and quarterly for new premiums into the policy. Prior to each new allocation we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed components, subject to minimum guarantees.  As mentioned previously, we offer survivorship versions of our individual UL products. These products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the second death.  Sales results are heavily influenced by the series of UL products with secondary guarantees. A UL policy with a secondary guarantee can stay in force, even if the base policy account value is zero, as long as secondary guarantee requirements have been met. The secondary guarantee requirement is based on the evaluation of a reference value within the policy, calculated in a manner similar to the base policy account value, but using different assumptions as to expense charges, COI charges and credited interest. The assumptions for the secondary guarantee requirement are listed in the contract. As long as the contract holder funds the policy to a level that keeps this calculated reference value positive, the death benefit will be guaranteed. The reference value has no actual monetary value to the contract holder; it is only a calculated value used to determine whether or not the policy will lapse should the base policy account value be less than zero.  Unlike other guaranteed death benefit designs, our secondary guarantee benefits maintain the flexibility of a traditional UL policy, which allows a contract holder to take loans or withdrawals. Although loans and withdrawals are likely to shorten the time period of the guaranteed death benefit, the guarantee is not automatically or completely forfeited, as is sometimes the case with other death benefit guarantee designs. The length of the guarantee may be increased at any time through additional excess premium deposits. Secondary guarantee UL face amount in force was $99.0 billion, $83.9 billion and $65.5 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For information on the reserving requirements for this business, see “Regulatory” below and “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” in the MD&A.  We manage investment margins (i.e. the difference between the amount the portfolio earns compared to the amount that is credited to the customer) by seeking to maximize current yields, in line with asset/liability and risk management targets, while crediting a competitive rate to the customer. Crediting rates are typically subject to guaranteed minimums specified in the underlying life insurance contract. Interest-sensitive life account values (including MoneyGuard® and the fixed portion of VUL) were $27.5 billion, $26.5 billion and $25.4 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   11    Table of Contents  Linked-benefit Life Products  Linked-benefit life products combine UL with long-term care insurance through the use of riders. The first rider allows the contract holder to accelerate death benefits on a tax-free basis in the event of a qualified long-term care need. The second rider extends the long-term care insurance benefits for an additional period of time if the death benefit is fully depleted for the purposes of long-term care. If the long-term care benefits are never used, the policy provides a tax-free death benefit to the contract holder’s heirs. Linked-benefit life products generate earnings through investment, mortality and morbidity margins. MoneyGuard® products are linked-benefit life products.  VUL  VUL products are UL products that provide a return on account values linked to an underlying investment portfolio of sub-accounts offered through the product. The value of the contract holder’s account varies with the performance of the sub-accounts chosen by the contract holder. The underlying assets of the sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance series of mutual funds. Premiums, net of expense loads and charges for mortality and expenses, received on VUL products are invested according to the contract holder’s investment option selection. As the return on the investment portfolio increases or decreases, the account value of the VUL policy will increase or decrease. As with fixed UL products, contract holders have access, within contractual maximums, to account values through loans, withdrawals and surrenders. Surrender charges are assessed during the surrender charge period, ranging from 0 to 20 years depending on the product. The investment choices we offer in VUL products are the same, in most cases, as the investment choices offered in our individual variable annuity contracts.  In addition, VUL products offer a fixed account option that is managed by us. Investment risk is borne by the customer on all but the fixed account option. We charge fees for mortality costs and administrative expenses as well as asset-based investment management fees. VUL account values (excluding the fixed portion of VUL) were $4.3 billion, $6.0 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.   We also offer survivorship versions of our individual VUL products. These products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the second death.  We also offer an enhanced single life version of our secondary guarantee VUL products with a survivorship option. These products combine the lapse protection elements of UL with the upside potential of a traditional VUL product, giving clients the flexibility to choose the appropriate balance between protection and market risk that meets their individual needs. The combined single life and survivorship face amount in force of these products was $4.9 billion, $4.0 billion and $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Term Life Insurance  Term life insurance provides a fixed death benefit for a scheduled period of time. It usually does not offer cash values. Scheduled policy premiums are required to be paid at least annually. Products offering a return of premium benefit payable at the end of a specified period are also available.  Distribution  The Life Insurance segment’s products are sold through LFD. LFD provides the Life Insurance segment with access to financial intermediaries in the following primary distribution channels - wire/regional firms, independent planner firms (including LFN), financial institutions and managing general agents/independent marketing organizations. LFD distributes COLI/BOLI products to approximately 15 intermediaries who specialize in the executive benefits market and are serviced through a network of internal and external sales professionals.  Competition  The life insurance industry is very competitive and consists of many companies with no one company dominating the market for all products. As of the end of 2007, the latest year for which data is available, there were 1,009 life insurance companies in the U.S., according to the American Council of Life Insurers.  The Life Insurance segment competes on product design and customer service. The Life Insurance segment designs products specifically for the high net worth and affluent markets. In addition to the growth opportunity offered by its target market, our product breadth, design innovation, competitiveness, speed to market, customer service, underwriting and risk management and extensive distribution network all contribute to the strength of the Life Insurance segment. On average, the development of products takes approximately six months. The Life Insurance segment implemented several major product upgrades and/or new features, including important UL, VUL, linked-benefit and term product enhancements in 2008. With respect to customer service, management tracks the speed, accuracy and responsiveness of service to customers’ calls and transaction requests. Further, the Life Insurance segment tracks the turnaround time and quality for various client services such as processing of applications.   12    Table of Contents  Underwriting  In the context of life insurance, underwriting is the process of evaluating medical and non-medical information about an individual and determining the effect these factors statistically have on life expectancy or mortality. This process of evaluation is often referred to as risk classification. Of course, no one can accurately predict how long any individual will live, but certain risk factors can affect life expectancy and are evaluated during the underwriting process.  Claims Administration  Claims services are delivered to customers from the Greensboro, North Carolina and Concord, New Hampshire home offices. Claims examiners are assigned to each claim notification based on coverage amount, type of claim and the experience of the examiner. Claims meeting certain criteria are referred to senior claim examiners. A formal quality assurance program is carried out to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of claims examining activities. A network of in-house legal counsel, compliance officers, medical personnel and an anti-fraud investigative unit also support claim examiners. A special team of claims examiners, in conjunction with claims management, focus on more complex claims matters such as long-term care claims, claims incurred during the contestable period, beneficiary disputes, litigated claims and the few invalid claims that are encountered.  The Life Insurance segment maintains a centralized claim service center in order to minimize the volume of clerical and repetitive administrative demands on its claims examiners while providing convenient service to policy owners and beneficiaries.     Insurance Solutions — Group Protection  Overview  The Group Protection segment offers group non-medical insurance products, principally term life, disability and dental, to the employer marketplace through various forms of contributory and noncontributory plans. Most of the segment’s group contracts are sold to employers with fewer than 500 employees.  The Group Protection segment was added as a result of the merger with Jefferson-Pilot and was then known as Benefit Partners. Accordingly, the insurance premium product line data (in millions) for this segment, provided in the following table, only include nine months during 2006:                                     For the Years Ended December 31,         2008     2007     2006       Insurance Premiums by Product Line                           Life   $ 541     $ 494     $ 334     Disability     672       601       407     Dental     150       136       95                           Total non-medical     1,363       1,231       836     Medical     154       149       113                           Total insurance premiums   $ 1,517     $ 1,380     $ 949                            Products  Group Life Insurance  We offer employer-sponsored group term life insurance products including basic, optional and voluntary term life insurance to employees and their dependents. Additional benefits may be provided in the event of a covered individual’s accidental death or dismemberment.   13    Table of Contents  Group Disability Insurance  We offer short- and long-term employer-sponsored group disability insurance, which protects an employee against loss of wages due to illness or injury. Short-term disability generally provides benefits for up to 26 weeks following a short waiting period, ranging from one to 30 days. Long-term disability provides benefits following a longer waiting period, usually between 30 and 180 days and provides benefits for a longer period, at least two years and typically extending to normal (Social Security) retirement age.  Group Dental  We offer employer-sponsored group dental insurance, which covers a portion of the cost of eligible dental procedures for employees and their dependents. Products offered include indemnity coverage, which does not distinguish benefits based on a dental provider’s participation in a network arrangement, and a Preferred Provider Organization (“PPO”) product that does reflect the dental provider’s participation in the PPO network arrangement, including agreement with network fee schedules.  Distribution  The segment’s products are marketed primarily through a national distribution system, including 143 managers and marketing representatives. The managers and marketing representatives develop business through employee benefit brokers, TPAs and other employee benefit firms.  Competition  The group protection marketplace is very competitive. Principal competitive factors include particular product features, price, quality of customer service and claims management, technological capabilities, financial strength and claims-paying ratings. In the group insurance market, the Group Protection segment competes with a limited number of major companies and selected other companies that focus on these products.  Underwriting  The Group Protection segment’s underwriters evaluate the risk characteristics of each employee group. Generally, the relevant characteristics evaluated include employee census information (such as age, gender, income and occupation), employer industry classification, geographic location, benefit design elements and other factors. The segment employs detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks. The segment uses technology to efficiently review, price and issue smaller cases, utilizing its underwriting staff on larger, more complex cases. Individual underwriting techniques (including evaluation of individual medical history information) may be used on certain covered individuals selecting larger benefit amounts. For voluntary and other forms of employee paid coverages, minimum participation requirements are used to obtain a better spread of risk and minimize the risk of anti-selection.  Claims Administration  Claims for the Group Protection segment are managed by a staff of experienced claim specialists. Disability claims management is especially important to segment results, as results depend on both the incidence and the length of approved disability claims. The segment employs nurses and rehabilitation specialists to help evaluate medical conditions and develop return to work plans. Independent medical reviews are routinely performed by external medical professionals to further evaluate conditions as part of the claim management process.     INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT  Overview  The Investment Management segment, with principal operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, provides investment products and services to both individual and institutional investors through Delaware Management Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates, (“Delaware Investments”). Delaware Investments offers a broad line of mutual funds and other investment products to retail investors (including managed accounts).  Delaware Investments also offers investment advisory services and products to institutional clients, such as corporate and public retirement plans, endowments and foundations, nuclear decommissioning trusts, Taft-Hartley plans and sub-advisory separate accounts for which Delaware Investments acts as a sub-advisor. As of December 31, 2008, Delaware Investments served as an investment advisor to approximately 190 institutional accounts, acted as investment manager and performed additional services for 81 open-end funds and for 7 closed-end funds. The Investment Management segment also provides investment advisory services for the general account of LNC’s insurance subsidiaries, including separate accounts and mutual funds, and acts as an investment advisor to collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”).   14    Table of Contents  Products  Investment Management products include U.S. and international equity and fixed-income retail mutual funds, institutional separate accounts, institutional mutual funds and managed accounts.  The Investment Management segment’s assets under management (including assets under administration) (in millions) were as follows:                                     As of December 31,         2008     2007     2006       Assets Under Management                           Retail — equity   $ 15,222     $ 31,598     $ 31,705     Retail — fixed     10,453       10,801       8,790                           Total retail     25,675       42,399       40,495                           Institutional — equity     11,203       21,751       21,977     Institutional — fixed (1)     9,696       11,536       21,105                           Total institutional     20,899       33,287       43,082                           Inter-segment assets     73,648       77,088       81,166                           Total assets under management   $ 120,222     $ 152,774     $ 164,743                           Total sub-advised assets, included above (2)   $ 10,227     $ 20,789     $ 22,671                                      (1)   In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Investment Management segment sold a portion of our institutional fixed-income business to an unaffiliated investment management company.     (2)   Effective May 1, 2007, the investment advisory role for the Lincoln Variable Insurance Trust, a product within our Retirement Solutions segment, transitioned from Investment Management to another internal advisor. In the role of investment advisor, Investment Management provided investment performance and compliance oversight on third-party investment managers in exchange for a fee. Investment Management is continuing to manage certain of the assets as a sub-advisor. As a result of this change, the Investment Management assets under management decreased by $3.2 billion, with a corresponding reduction in investment advisory fees — inter-segment and associated expenses.   Retail Products and Services  The Investment Management segment offers various retail products including mutual funds to individual investors, as well as investment services to high net worth and small institutional investors through managed accounts. The external retail assets under management were $25.7 billion, $42.4 billion and $40.5 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These assets include $8.0 billion, $16.2 billion and $18.0 billion of sub-advised assets as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We pay fees to the third-party sub-advisors to manage the assets. See “Results of Investments Management” in the MD&A for discussion of the decline in retail assets under management.  The Investment Management segment, through Delaware Investments, offers open-end and closed-end mutual funds to suit an array of investment needs. Delaware Investments’ mutual funds are grouped by asset class, with each investment management team focused on a specific investment discipline. This structure of distinct investment teams allows for a style-specific research effort tailored for each asset class. The mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by Delaware Investments. Delaware Investments manages the funds pursuant to an agreement with the separate funds’ boards. Accordingly, the mutual fund assets and liabilities, as well as related investment returns, are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Instead, Delaware Investments earns fees for providing the management and other services to the funds. However, Delaware’s assets under management do include seed capital investments in new products, which are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are marked-to-market through net income on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Delaware Investments manages both open-end and closed-end funds. An open-end mutual fund does not have a fixed number of shares and will normally offer as many shares as investors are willing to buy. Investors sell their shares by requesting the fund to redeem the shares. The open-end funds are available with various pricing structures, such as A-class with a front end sales charge and C-class with a contingent deferred sales charge, as well as R-class and Institutional class, which are sold without a front end or contingent deferred sales charge and are designed for certain retirement plans and/or institutional investors. Effective May 2007, no new or subsequent investments are allowed in the B-class except through a reinvestment of dividends or capital gains by existing shareholders. A-, B-, C- and R-classes are generally subject to Rule 12b-1 fees. A closed-end fund offers a fixed number of shares and is usually sold through a brokerage firm. After the initial offering, shares normally trade on a major stock exchange.   15    Table of Contents  The Investment Management segment also provides investment advisory services to clients through separately managed accounts, commonly referred to as wrap accounts. These products are offered by a sponsor, typically a broker-dealer, to higher net worth individuals with a minimum investment of approximately $250,000. During 2006, the Investment Management segment closed the International American Depository Receipt (“ADR”) separately managed account product, which is sub-advised by Mondrian, and the Delaware Large Cap Growth Equity separately managed account to new investors. During 2008, both of these products were reopened to new investors. An ADR is a security that trades in the U.S., but represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation. ADRs are bought and sold on U.S. markets just like traditional stocks and are issued or sponsored in the U.S. by a bank or brokerage firm.  Institutional Products and Services  For institutional clients, the Investment Management segment offers Delaware Pooled Trust and institutional separate accounts and manages CDOs. External institutional assets under management were $20.9 billion, $33.3 billion and $43.1 billion as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Delaware Pooled Trust is a registered investment company that offers a series of mutual funds managed in styles that are similar to institutional separate account offerings and are best suited for smaller- to medium-sized institutional investment mandates. Delaware Pooled Trust’s minimum initial investment is typically $1 million. The funds included in Delaware Pooled Trust are offered without a sales charge directly through Delaware Investments’ institutional marketing and client services group.  The Investment Management segment provides investment advisory services through individually managed accounts to a broad range of institutional clients, such as corporate and public retirement plans, endowments and foundations, nuclear decommissioning trusts, sub-advisory clients and Taft-Hartley plans, among others. Included among sub-advisory clients are mutual funds and other commingled vehicles offered by institutional parties. Most clients utilize individually managed separate accounts, which means clients have the opportunity to customize the management of their portfolio by including or excluding certain types of securities, sectors or segments within a given asset class. Because of their individually managed nature, these separate accounts are best suited for larger investment mandates. Currently, the minimum account size is typically $25 million.  The Investment Management segment also provides investment advisory services for CDOs. CDOs are pools of debt instruments that are securitized and sold to investors through a sponsor, typically an investment bank. The Investment Management segment does not invest in these securities, but the insurance portfolios of LNC’s insurance subsidiaries are invested in certain of these securities. The Investment Management segment provides investment advisory services at a fee. As of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Investment Management segment provided advisory services for $5.0 billion, $6.1 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, of CDOs.  As stated in “Acquisitions and Dispositions” above, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed the sale of certain institutional taxable fixed income business with an unaffiliated investment management company involving certain members of our fixed income team and related institutional taxable fixed income business.  The Investment Management segment also provides investment management services for LNC’s general account assets for which it earns advisory revenue.  Distribution  The businesses in the Investment Management segment deliver their broad range of products through multiple distribution channels, enabling them to reach an expanding community of retail and institutional investors. Investment Management distributes retail mutual funds and managed accounts through intermediaries, including LFN, which are serviced by the LFD wholesaling distribution network. Delaware Distributors, L.P. is the principal underwriter for the Delaware Investments mutual funds and serves as a liaison between the funds and LFD.  Delaware Investments’ institutional marketing group, working closely with manager selection consultants, markets substantially all of the institutional products.   16    Table of Contents  Competition  The Investment Management segment primarily competes with mutual fund complexes that are broker sold, and other asset managers offering managed accounts, institutional accounts and sub-advisory services. Competitive factors impacting the Investment Management segment include investment performance, breadth of investment styles offered, distribution capabilities and customer service.  Investment performance is a key driver of the Investment Management segment’s ability to attract new sales, retain existing assets and improve net flows. The following table summarizes the performance of institutional and managed accounts composites relative to their respective benchmarks for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2008:                                     One Year     Three Year     Five Year       Number of institutional composites outperforming their respective benchmarks (1)   4 of 8   3 of 8   4 of 7   Number of managed account styles outperforming their respective benchmarks (2)   3 of 7   2 of 7   3 of 5              (1)   Represents the largest composites based on assets under management. The returns for these composites are Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) compliant and the benchmarks are industry standards.     (2)   Represents Delaware Investments’ managed account styles that have associated benchmarks for the respective length of time.   Delaware Investments closely monitors the relative performance of individual funds. Fund performance is compared to a benchmark group of peer funds that have similar investment characteristics and objectives. Performance in various key categories, as reported to Lipper, one of the leading providers of mutual fund research, is used by Delaware Investments in measuring its funds’ performance. The following table summarizes the performance for the 25 largest mutual funds and for all of the mutual funds in the Delaware Investments’ family of funds for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2008:                                     One Year     Three Year     Five Year       Number of funds out of Delaware’s top 25 retail mutual funds in top half of their Lipper category (1)   19 of 25   16 of 25   15 of 25   Number of all retail mutual funds in top half of their Lipper category (1)   28 of 41   25 of 41   27 of 40              (1)   For these purposes, Delaware Investments’ family of funds does not include variable insurance product funds or mutual funds managed by Delaware Investments for certain of our affiliates or other third parties.      LINCOLN UK  Overview  Lincoln UK is headquartered in Barnwood, Gloucester, England and is licensed to do business throughout the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). Lincoln UK is primarily focused on protecting and enhancing the value of its existing customer base. The segment accepts new deposits on the existing block of business and markets a limited range of life and retirement income products.  Lincoln UK’s product portfolio principally consists of unit-linked life and pension products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products, where the risk associated with the underlying investments is borne by the contract holders. These products have largely been issued to individuals, and benefits, premium levels and charges can often be varied within limits. Certain contract holders have chosen to contract out of the U.K. government’s pension scheme through a Lincoln personal pension arrangement for which Lincoln UK receives rebate premiums from the government.   17    Table of Contents  The Lincoln UK segment’s product revenues (in millions) were as follows:                                     For the Years Ended December 31,         2008     2007     2006       Product Revenues                           Life products   $ 106     $ 121     $ 95     Pension products     136       160       131     Other products     6       8       11                           Total product revenues   $ 248     $ 289     $ 237                            Product revenues include premiums, fees and assessments for Lincoln UK’s products.  Our subsidiary in the U.K. has its balance sheets and income statements translated at the current spot exchange rate as of the year-end and average spot exchange rate for the year, respectively.  Lincoln UK has an evergreen agreement to outsource its customer service and policy administration functions to Capita Life & Pensions Services Limited, a subsidiary of Capita Group Plc (“Capita”). The purpose of the outsourcing is to reduce the operational risk and variability of future costs associated with administering the business by taking advantage of Capita’s proven expertise in providing outsourcing solutions to a variety of industries including insurance companies. To date, the relationship has provided the segment with results in line with expectations.  Competition  The U.K. life insurance market is very competitive and consists of many companies, with no one company dominating the market for all products. Lincoln UK markets a limited range of new unit-linked life and pension products through independent intermediaries. The main factors upon which entities in this market compete are distribution access, product features, investment choice, cost, customer service, brand recognition and financial strength.     OTHER OPERATIONS  Other Operations includes the results of operations that are not directly related to the business segments, unallocated corporate items and the ongoing amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity reinsurance portion of the sale of our former reinsurance segment to Swiss Re in the fourth quarter of 2001. Unallocated corporate items include investment income on investments related to the amount of statutory surplus in our insurance subsidiaries that is not allocated to our business units and other corporate investments, such as our remaining radio properties, interest expense on short-term and long-term borrowings, our closed block of run-off pension business in the form of group annuity and insured funding-type of contracts with assets under management of approximately $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2008, and certain expenses, including restructuring and merger-related expenses. Other Operations also includes the eliminations of inter-company transactions and the inter-segment elimination of the investment advisory fees for asset management services the Investment Management segment provides to Retirement Solutions and Insurance Solutions.  Revenues (in millions) from Other Operations were as follows:                                     For the Years Ended December 31,         2008     2007     2006       Operating Revenues                           Insurance premiums   $ 4     $ 3     $ 9     Net investment income     358       372       373     Amortization of deferred gain on business sold through reinsurance     74       74       75     Media revenues (net)     85       107       85     Other revenues and fees     —       4       (1 )   Inter-segment elimination of investment advisory fees     (82 )     (87 )     (97 )                         Total operating revenues   $ 439     $ 473     $ 444                             18    Table of Contents     REINSURANCE  We follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our life insurance and annuity risks with unaffiliated reinsurers. In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium. We use reinsurance to protect our insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims and unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss. We also use reinsurance to improve our results by leveraging favorable reinsurance pricing. Although reinsurance does not discharge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to their contract holders for losses insured under the insurance policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk. Because we bear the risk of nonpayment by one or more of our reinsurers, we primarily cede reinsurance to well-capitalized, highly rated reinsurers.  We reinsure approximately 50% to 55% of the mortality risk on newly issued non-term life insurance contracts and approximately 40% to 45% of total mortality risk including term insurance contracts. Our policy for this program is to retain no more than $10 million on a single insured life issued on fixed and VUL insurance contracts. Additionally, the retention per single insured life for term life insurance and for COLI is $2 million for each type of insurance.  From July 2007 until June 2008, we reinsured our Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage rider related to our variable annuities. Swiss Re provided 50% quota share coinsurance of our lifetime GWB, Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage, for business written in 2007 and 2008, up to a total of $3.8 billion in deposits.  Portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance (“Modco”) basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks. In a Modco program, the reinsurer shares proportionally in all financial terms of the reinsured policies (i.e. premiums, expenses, claims, etc.) based on their respective quota share of the risk.  In addition, we acquire other reinsurance to cover products other than as discussed above with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances.  We obtain reinsurance from a diverse group of reinsurers and we monitor concentration and financial strength ratings of our principal reinsurers. Swiss Re represents our largest exposure. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the amounts recoverable from reinsurers were $8.5 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, of which $4.5 billion and $4.3 billion was recoverable from Swiss Re for the same periods, respectively.  For more information regarding reinsurance, see “Reinsurance” in the MD&A and Note 9. For risks involving reinsurance, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We face a risk of non-collectibility of reinsurance, which could materially affect our results of operations.”     RESERVES  The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These reserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation.  For more information on reserves, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Derivatives” and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Obligations” in the MD&A.   See “Regulatory” below for information on permitted practices and proposed regulations that may impact the amount of statutory reserves necessary to support our current insurance liabilities.   For risks related to reserves, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Changes in interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and may result in increased contract withdrawals.”     INVESTMENTS  An important component of our financial results is the return on invested assets. Our investment strategy is to balance the need for current income with prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income to meet our obligations. This approach requires the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach also permits us to be more effective in our asset-liability management because decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. Investments by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with the insurance laws and regulations of the states of domicile.   19    Table of Contents  We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes and income generation. Hedging strategies are employed for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, hedging certain portions of our exposure to changes in our GDB, GWB and GIB liabilities, interest rate fluctuations, the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity U.S. Government obligations and credit, foreign exchange and equity risks. Income generation strategies include credit default swaps through replication synthetic asset transactions. These derivatives synthetically create exposure in the general account to corporate debt, similar to investing in the credit markets. Our investment portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers. As of December 31, 2008, we had investments in the collateralized mortgage obligation industry with a fair value of $6.8 billion, or 10% of the invested assets portfolio totaling $67.3 billion. We did not have a concentration of financial instruments in a single industry as of December 31, 2007.   For additional information on our investments, including carrying values by category, quality ratings and net investment income, see “Consolidated Investments” in the MD&A, as well as Notes 1 and 5.     RATINGS  The Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and the debt of LNC. Ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities.  Rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to pay claims, factors more relevant to contract holders than investors. We believe that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized, independent rating agencies are material to our operations. There may be other rating agencies that also rate our securities, which we do not disclose in our reports.  Insurer Financial Strength Ratings  The insurer financial strength rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and S&P are characterized as follows:     •   A.M. Best — A++ to S       •   Fitch — AAA to C       •   Moody’s — Aaa to C       •   S&P — AAA to R    As of February 26, 2009, the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our securities, or us, were as follows:                                             A. M. Best     Fitch     Moody’s     S&P       The Lincoln National Life Insurance Co.

(“FPP”)     A+     AA     A1     A+       (2nd of 16)   (3rd of 21)   (5th of 21)   (5th of 21)    A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products, as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings.   20    Table of Contents  Debt Ratings  The long-term credit rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P are characterized as follows:     •   A.M. Best — aaa to rs       •   Fitch — AAA to D       •   Moody’s — Aaa to C       •   S&P — AAA to D    As of February 26, 2009, our long-term credit ratings, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our long-term credit, were as follows:                     A. M. Best   Fitch   Moody’s   S&P     a-   A   A3   A-   (7th of 23)   (6th of 21)   (7th of 21)   (7th of 22)    The short-term credit rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings, Moody’s and S&P are characterized as follows:     •   A.M. Best — AMB-1+ to d       •   Fitch — F1+ to D       •   Moody’s — P-1 to NP       •   S&P — A-1+ to D    As of February 26, 2009, our short-term credit ratings, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our short-term credit, were as follows:                     A. M. Best   Fitch   Moody’s   S&P     AMB-1   F1   P-2   A-2   (2nd of 6)   (2nd of 7)   (2nd of 4)   (3rd of 10)    A downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital. In addition, a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above.  On February 10, 2009, Moody’s placed LNC’s senior debt rating and the insurance financial strength ratings of the insurance subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade, but affirmed its stable outlook for LNC’s short-term credit rating. Placing the company’s ratings under review for possible downgrade indicates that Lincoln’s ratings could be affirmed or lowered in the near term based on developments in financial market conditions, and/or Lincoln’s business performance or financial measures. On February 20, 2009, A.M. Best downgraded our long-term credit rating to “a-” from “a,” and affirmed the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. Additionally, A.M. Best revised its ratings outlook to negative from stable. On February 26, 2009, S&P downgraded our long-term credit rating to “A-” from “A+,” our short-term credit rating to “A-2” from “A-1” and the insurance financial strength ratings of the insurance subsidiaries to “AA-” from “AA.” S&P revised its outlook for the holding company to stable from negative and maintained its stable outlook for the insurance subsidiaries.  In late September and early October of 2008, A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P each revised their outlook for the U.S. life insurance sector to negative from stable. We believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. In addition, actions we take to access third-party financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings.  All of our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that our principal insurance subsidiaries or LNC can maintain these ratings. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.   21    Table of Contents     REGULATORY  Insurance Regulation  Our insurance subsidiaries, like other insurance companies, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states, territories and countries in which they are licensed to do business. The extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to supervisory agencies. In the U.S., this power is vested in state insurance departments.   In supervising and regulating insurance companies, state insurance departments, charged primarily with protecting contract holders and the public rather than investors, enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance laws and regulation for that purpose. Our principal insurance subsidiaries, LNL, LLANY and FPP, are domiciled in the states of Indiana, New York and Indiana, respectively.  The insurance departments of the domiciliary states exercise principal regulatory jurisdiction over our insurance subsidiaries. The extent of regulation by the states varies, but in general, most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing standards of solvency, adequacy of reserves, reinsurance, capital adequacy, licensing of companies and agents to transact business, prescribing and approving policy forms, regulating premium rates for some lines of business, prescribing the form and content of financial statements and reports, regulating the type and amount of investments permitted and standards of business conduct. Insurance company regulation is discussed further under “Insurance Holding Company Regulation” and “Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments.”  As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic, generally once every three to five years, examinations of the books, records, accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their states. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, we have not received any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of our insurance subsidiaries conducted during this three-year period.  State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S. insurance companies to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business, and the operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. Our U.S. insurance companies prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has approved a series of statutory accounting principles that have been adopted, in some cases with minor modifications, by virtually all state insurance departments.   We received approval from the Indiana Department of Insurance for a permitted practice to the prescribed NAIC statutory accounting principles for our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008. The permitted practice modifies the statutory accounting for deferred income taxes prescribed by the NAIC by increasing the realization period for deferred tax assets from one to three years and increasing the asset recognition limit from 10% to 15% of statutory capital and surplus. This permitted practice is expected to benefit the statutory capital and surplus of our Indiana-domiciled insurance subsidiaries by approximately $300 million, but may not be considered when calculating the dividends available from the insurance subsidiaries. We also received approval from the Department for two more permitted practices for LNL relating to the application of specified mortality tables for life insurance. These are expected to benefit the statutory capital and surplus of LNL by approximately $16 million.  A new statutory reserving standard, Actuarial Guideline 43, Commissioners Annuity Reserve Valuation Method for Variable Annuities (“VACARVM”), replaces current statutory reserve practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, such as GWBs. VACARVM was adopted by the NAIC in September 2008 and will be effective as of December 31, 2009. Based upon the level of variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2008, we estimate that VACARVM would have decreased our statutory capital by $125 million to $175 million. The actual impact of the adoption will be dependent upon account values and conditions that exist as of December 31, 2009. We plan to utilize existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as pursue additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, to lessen any negative impact on statutory capital and dividend capacity in our life insurance subsidiaries. However, additional statutory reserves could lead to lower risk-based capital (“RBC”) ratios and potentially reduce future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. For more information on VACARVM and our use of captive reinsurance structures, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition — Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the MD&A.   22    Table of Contents  Insurance Holding Company Regulation  LNC and its primary insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the insurance holding company laws of the states of Indiana and New York. These insurance holding company laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such insurance holding company’s system to register with the insurance department authorities, to file with it certain reports disclosing information including their capital structure, ownership, management, financial condition, and certain inter-company transactions, including material transfers of assets and inter-company business agreements and to report material changes in that information. These laws also require that inter-company transactions be fair and reasonable and, under certain circumstances, prior approval of the insurance departments must be received before entering into an inter-company transaction. Further, these laws require that an insurer’s contract holders’ surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs.  In general, under state holding company regulations, no person may acquire, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in our capital stock unless such person, corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner for such acquisition of control. Pursuant to such laws, in general, any person acquiring, controlling or holding the power to vote, directly or indirectly, ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurance company, is presumed to have “control” of such company. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact. The insurance commissioner, however, may find that “control” exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls a smaller amount of voting securities. To obtain approval from the insurance commissioner of any acquisition of control of an insurance company, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an application containing information regarding: the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates; the nature, source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition; the financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates; any potential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer; the number and type of securities to be acquired; any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired; any agreements with broker-dealers; and other matters.  Other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions. Additional requirements in those jurisdictions may include re-licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control. As further described below, laws that govern the holding company structure also govern payment of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries.  Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments  We are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries. Our primary assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us.  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), only from unassigned surplus or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous twelve months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus. As discussed above, we may not consider the permitted practice to the prescribed statutory accounting principles relating to the deferred tax asset in calculating available dividends. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, LLANY, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.  Indiana law also provides that following the payment of any dividend, the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs, and permits the Indiana Insurance Commissioner to bring an action to rescind a dividend which violates these standards. In the event that the Indiana Insurance Commissioner determines that the contract holders’ surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate, the Commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit of that insurance subsidiary. For information regarding dividends paid to us during 2008 from our insurance subsidiaries, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” in the MD&A.  Lincoln UK’s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the U.K. Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) and are subject to capital requirements as defined by the U.K. Capital Resources Requirement. Lincoln UK maintains a target of approximately 1.5 to 2.0 times the required capital as prescribed by the regulatory resource requirement. Effective January 1, 2005, all insurance companies operating in the U.K. also have to complete an RBC assessment to demonstrate to the FSA that they hold sufficient capital to cover their risks. RBC requirements in the U.K. are different than the NAIC requirements. In addition, the FSA imposes certain minimum capital requirements for the combined U.K. subsidiaries. As is the case with regulated insurance companies in the U.S., future changes to regulatory capital requirements could impact the dividend capacity of our U.K. insurance subsidiaries and cash flow to the holding company.   23    Table of Contents  Risk-Based Capital  The NAIC has adopted RBC requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. There are five major risks involved in determining the requirements:                 Category   Name   Description     Asset risk — affiliates    C-0    Risk of assets’ default for certain affiliated investments   Asset risk — other    C-1    Risk of assets’ default of principal and interest or fluctuation in fair value   Insurance risk    C-2    Risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing business to be written in the future   Interest rate risk, health credit risk and market risk    C-3    Risk of losses due to changes in interest rate levels, risk that health benefits prepaid to providers become the obligation of the health insurer once again and risk of loss due to changes in market levels associated with variable products with guarantees   Business risk    C-4    Risk of general business    A company’s risk-based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Regulators can then measure adequacy of a company’s statutory surplus by comparing it to the RBC determined by the formula. Under RBC requirements, regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to its company action level of RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as defined by the NAIC. Accordingly, factors that have an impact on the total adjusted capital of our insurance subsidiaries, such as the permitted practices discussed above, will also affect their RBC levels.  Four levels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the RBC ratio is insufficient:     •   “Company action level” — If the RBC ratio is between 75% and 100%, then the insurer must submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it proposes to undertake;       •   “Regulatory action level” — If the RBC ratio is between 50% and 75%, then the insurer must submit a plan, but a regulator may also issue a corrective order requiring the insurer to comply within a specified period;       •   “Authorized control level” — If the RBC ratio is between 35% and 50%, then the regulatory response is the same as at the “Regulatory action level,” but in addition, the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer; and       •   “Mandatory control level” — If the RBC ratio is less than 35%, then the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer.    As of December 31, 2008, the RBC ratios of LNL, LLANY and FPP reported to their respective states of domicile and the NAIC all exceeded the “company action level.” We believe that we will be able to maintain the RBC ratios of our insurance subsidiaries in excess of “company action level” through prudent underwriting, claims handling, investing and capital management. However, no assurances can be given that developments affecting the insurance subsidiaries, many of which could be outside of our control, will not cause the RBC ratios to fall below our targeted levels. These developments may include, but may not be limited to: changes to the manner in which the RBC ratio is calculated; new regulatory requirements for calculating reserves such as VACARVM and principles based reserving; economic conditions leading to higher levels of impairments of securities in our insurance subsidiaries’ general accounts; and an inability to securitize life reserves including the issuing of letters of credit supporting captive reinsurance structures.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings.”   24    Table of Contents  Federal Initiatives  The U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry; however, federal initiatives from time to time can impact the insurance industry. In reaction to the current credit market illiquidity and global financial crisis, Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) on October 3, 2008, and enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) on February 17, 2009, in an effort to restore liquidity to the U.S. credit markets. The EESA defines financial institutions to include insurance companies. The EESA contains the TARP. The TARP authorized the U.S. Treasury to purchase “troubled assets” (as defined in the TARP) from financial institutions, including insurance companies. Pursuant to the authority granted under the TARP, the U.S. Treasury has adopted the CPP, the Generally Available Capital Access Program (“GACAP”) and the Exceptional Financial Recovery Assistance (“EFRA”). The ARRA contains provisions impacting participants in these various capital assistance programs, such as limits imposed on executive compensation. Under the CPP, as currently adopted, bank and thrift holding companies may apply to the U.S. Treasury for the direct sale of preferred stock and warrants to the U.S. Treasury. We filed an application with the U.S. Treasury to participate in the CPP, but there are no assurances that the U.S. Treasury will approve our application, or that we will participate in the GACAP or the EFRA. It remains unclear at this point if or when the EESA and the ARRA will restore sustained liquidity and confidence in the markets and its affect on the fair value of our invested assets.  In June 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (“EGTRRA”) was enacted. The EGTRRA contains provisions that have and will continue, near term, to significantly lower individual tax rates. These may have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the inside build-up of annuities and life insurance products. The EGTRRA also includes provisions that will eliminate, over time, the estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes and partially eliminates the step-up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent’s estate. Some of these changes might hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance and annuity products. These provisions expire after 2010, unless extended.  In May 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (“JGTRRA”) was enacted. Individual taxpayers are the principal beneficiaries of the JGTRRA, which includes an acceleration of certain of the income tax rate reductions enacted originally under the EGTRRA, as well as capital gains and dividend tax rate reductions. On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 (“TIPRA”) was signed into law. TIPRA extends the lower capital gains and dividends rates through the end of 2010. Although most of these rate reductions expire after 2010, these reductions have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products. Like the EGTRRA changes, the JGTRRA changes may hinder our sales and result in increased surrender of insurance and annuity products.  On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) was signed into law. The PPA makes numerous changes to pension and other tax laws including: permanence for the EGTRRA enacted pension provisions including higher annual contribution limits for defined contribution plans and IRAs as well as catch-up contributions for persons over age 50; clarification of the safest available annuity standard for the selection of an annuity as a distribution option for defined contribution plans; expansion of investment advice options for defined contribution plan participants and IRA owners; more stringent funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans and clarification of the legal status of hybrid (cash balance) pension plans; non-pension related tax changes, such as the codification of COLI best practices, bringing more certainty to this market segment; permanence for EGTRRA enacted tax benefits for Section 529 college savings plans; and favorable tax treatment for long-term care insurance included as a rider to or on annuity products. We expect many of these changes to have a beneficial effect upon various segments of our business lines.  The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”), enacted in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain provisions that may be different, conflicting or more rigorous. The increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and share information with other financial institutions require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.  Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) Considerations  ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibitions on transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a party in interest. ERISA also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, asset management, plan administrative services and other businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA, including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition to ERISA regulation of businesses providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status.   25    Table of Contents  Broker-Dealer, Securities and Savings and Loan Regulation  Some of our separate accounts as well as mutual funds that we sponsor, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some or all states and the District of Columbia. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and are subject to federal and state regulation, including but not limited to the Financial Industry Regulation Authority’s (“FINRA”) net capital rules. In addition, we have several subsidiaries that are investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. LFN’s registered representatives and our employees, insofar as they are involved in the sale or marketing of products that are securities, are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), FINRA and state securities commissioners. Regulation also extends to various LNC entities that employ or control those individuals. The SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees.  Our U.S. banking operations are subject to federal and state regulation. As a result of its ownership of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, which was approved on January 8, 2009, LNC is considered to be a savings and loan holding company and, along with Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, is subject to annual examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Federal and state banking laws generally provide that no person may acquire control of LNC, and gain indirect control of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, without prior regulatory approval. Generally, beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of LNC would be presumed to constitute control.  As a savings and loan holding company, we have applied to participate in the FDIC’s TLGP. Under the TLGP, the FDIC will guarantee newly issued senior unsecured debt issued on or before June 30, 2009. The amount guaranteed may not exceed 125% of the par or face value of senior unsecured debt outstanding as of September 30, 2008, that is scheduled to mature on or before June 30, 2009. This means only debt maturing before June 30, 2009, can be included in calculating the cap. The FDIC can vary the cap. The debt guarantee expires June 30, 2012, regardless if the debt matures later. The proceeds of guaranteed debt cannot be used to prepay debt that is not guaranteed. Entities participating in the TLGP are subject to enhanced supervisory oversight to prevent rapid growth or excessive risk taking, including additional reporting and on-site reviews to determine compliance with the TLGP. There can be assurance that the FDIC will approve our participation in the TLGP.  Environmental Considerations  Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations apply to our ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risk of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up, which could adversely affect our commercial mortgage lending. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against such property. In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), we may be liable, as an “owner” or “operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us. We also risk environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged to us. Federal legislation provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that certain requirements are met. However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to CERCLA liability. Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for costs associated with environmental hazards.  We routinely conduct environmental assessments for real estate we acquire for investment and before taking title through foreclosure to real property collateralizing mortgages that we hold. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, based on these environmental assessments and compliance with our internal procedures, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.   26    Table of Contents  Intellectual Property  We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. We have implemented a patent strategy designed to protect innovative aspects of our products and processes which we believe distinguish us from competitors. We currently own four issued U.S. patents and have additional patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Our currently issued U.S. patents will expire between 2015 and 2021. We intend to continue to file patent applications as we develop new products, technologies and patentable enhancements.  We regard our patents as valuable assets and intend to vigorously protect them against infringement. However, complex legal and factual determinations and evolving laws make patent protection uncertain, and while we believe our patents provide us with a competitive advantage, we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending patent applications or that any issued patents will have sufficient breadth to offer meaningful protection. In addition, our issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented or found unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. We have in the past instituted litigation against competitors to enforce our intellectual property rights with success. For example, we recently won a $13 million judgment that upheld the validity of one of our patents and found infringement by the defendants. We are currently reviewing the judgment and its applicability in relation to other potentially infringing parties.  Finally, we have an extensive portfolio of trademarks and service marks that we consider important in the marketing of our products and services, including, among others, the trademarks of the Lincoln National and Lincoln Financial names, the Lincoln silhouette logo and the combination of these marks. Trademark registrations may be renewed indefinitely subject to continued use and registration requirements. We regard our trademarks as valuable assets in marketing our products and services and protect them against infringement.     EMPLOYEES  As of December 31, 2008, we had a total of 9,696 employees. In addition, we had a total of 1,486 planners and agents who had active sales contracts with one of our insurance subsidiaries. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.     AVAILABLE INFORMATION  We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including LNC, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.  We also make available, free of charge, on or through our Internet website http://www.lincolnfinancial.com, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.  The information on the website listed above is not, and should not, be considered part of this annual report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference in this document. This website is, and is only intended to be, an inactive textual reference.   27    Table of Contents     Item 1A. Risk Factors  You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. In that case, the value of our securities could decline substantially.  Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.  The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than twelve months. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers.  We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. An extended disruption in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect LNC and its subsidiaries’ ability to access sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in the current market environment. In addition, further other-than-temporary impairments could reduce our statutory surplus, leading to lower RBC ratios and potentially reducing future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries.  We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, to maintain our securities lending activities and to replace certain maturing liabilities. Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our operations, and our business will suffer. As a holding company with no direct operations, our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance and investment management subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations, including the $500 million of senior securities due in April 2009, and to pay dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses depends significantly upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. Payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws and regulations of their respective jurisdictions, including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Changes in these laws can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses. For our insurance and other subsidiaries, the principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums and fees, annuity considerations, investment advisory fees, and cash flow from our investment portfolio and assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. At the holding company level, sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments, including credit facilities, commercial paper and medium- and long-term debt.  In the event that current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional financing. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us as has happened recently. See “Item 1. Business — Ratings” for a complete description of our ratings and ratings outlook. Our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.  Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business, most significantly our insurance operations. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities; satisfy statutory capital requirements; generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs; and access the capital necessary to grow our business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Recently, our credit spreads have widened considerably, which increases the interest rate we must pay on any new debt obligation we may issue. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets.   28    Table of Contents  Difficult conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future.  Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. The stress experienced by global capital markets that began in the second half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during the second half of 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008. Recently, concerns over unemployment, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the U.S. have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile oil prices and declining business and consumer confidence, have precipitated a recession. In addition, the fixed-income markets are experiencing a period of extreme volatility, which has negatively impacted market liquidity conditions. Initially, the concerns on the part of market participants were focused on the subprime segment of the mortgage-backed securities market. However, these concerns have since expanded to include a broad range of mortgage- and asset-backed and other fixed income securities, including those rated investment grade, the U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, and a wide range of financial institutions and markets, asset classes and sectors. As a result, the market for fixed income instruments has experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events and increased probability of default. Securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and may be hard to sell, if desired. Domestic and international equity markets have also been experiencing heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers (such as our company) that have exposure to the real estate, mortgage and credit markets particularly affected. These events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and are also dependent upon customer behavior. Our revenues are likely to decline in such circumstances and our profit margins could erode. In addition, in the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the global credit crisis, we could incur significant losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.  Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The current mortgage crisis has also raised the possibility of future legislative and regulatory actions in addition to the recent enactments of the EESA and the ARRA that could further impact our business. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A continuation of current economic conditions may require us to raise additional capital or consider other transactions to manage our capital position or our liquidity.  If our businesses do not perform well and/or the price of our common stock does not increase, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2008, we had a total of $3.9 billion of goodwill on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, of which $2.2 billion related to our Insurance Solutions — Life Insurance segment and $1.0 billion related to our Retirement Solutions — Annuities segment. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the “reporting unit” to which the goodwill relates. The reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. The fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business. If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, i.e. when the fair value of the “reporting unit” is not expected to recover in a reasonable amount of time, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we took total pre-tax impairment charges of $176 million, primarily related to our media assets.  If current market conditions persist during 2009, in particular, if our share price remains below book value per share, or if we take actions to limit risk associated with our products or investments that causes a significant change in any one reporting unit’s fair value, this may trigger goodwill impairment testing at the end of each quarter as part of an annual or interim impairment test. We expect to perform interim tests of goodwill impairment in addition to our annual test during 2009, especially if our market capitalization remains below our book value. Subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in impairment of goodwill during 2009, as early as the first quarter. These subsequent reviews of goodwill could result in additional impairment of goodwill during 2009, and such write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position, but will not affect the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries. For more information on goodwill, see Note 8 and the MD&A.   29    Table of Contents  Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. Factors in management’s determination include the performance of the business, including the ability to generate capital gains from a variety of sources and tax planning strategies. If, based on available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income. Such valuation allowance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, but will not affect the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries.  There can be no assurance that actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets will achieve the intended effect.  In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, on October 3, 2008, the EESA was signed into law and on February 17, 2009, the ARRA was signed into law. The federal government, Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis. There can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility currently being experienced.  The difficulties faced by other financial institutions could adversely affect us.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to it. We also may have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, derivative transactions and/or equity investments. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Furthermore, we distribute a significant amount of our insurance, annuity and mutual fund products through large financial institutions. We believe that the mergers of several of these entities, as well as the negative impact of the markets on these entities, has disrupted and may lead to further disruption of their businesses, which may have a negative effect on our production levels.  Our participation in a securities lending program and a reverse repurchase program subjects us to potential liquidity and other risks.  We participate in a securities lending program for our general account whereby fixed income securities are loaned by our agent bank to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms and commercial banks. The borrowers of our securities provide us with collateral, typically in cash, which we separately maintain. We invest such cash collateral in other securities, primarily in commercial paper and money market or other short term funds. Securities with a cost or amortized cost of $430 million and a fair value of $410 million were on loan under the program as of December 31, 2008. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or repledged by the transferee. We were liable for cash collateral under our control of $427 million as of December 31, 2008.  We participate in a reverse repurchase program for our general account whereby we sell fixed income securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms, with a concurrent agreement to repurchase those same securities at a determined future date. The borrowers of our securities provide us with cash collateral which is typically invested in fixed maturity securities. The fair value of securities pledged under reverse repurchase agreements was $496 million as of December 31, 2008.  As of December 31, 2008, substantially all of the securities on loan under the program could be returned to us by the borrowers at any time. Collateral received under the reverse repurchase program cannot be returned prior to maturity, however, market conditions on the repurchase date may limit our ability to enter into new agreements. The return of loaned securities or our inability to enter into new reverse repurchase agreements would require us to return the cash collateral associated with such securities. In addition, in some cases, the maturity of the securities held as invested collateral (i.e. securities that we have purchased with cash received from the third parties) may exceed the term of the related securities and the market value may fall below the amount of cash received as collateral and invested. If we are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice and we are forced to sell securities to meet the return obligation, we may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize under normal market conditions, or both. In addition, under stressful capital market and economic conditions, such as those conditions we have experienced recently, liquidity broadly deteriorates, which may further restrict our ability to sell securities.   30    Table of Contents  Our reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may prove to be inadequate.  We establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For our life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy, the lapse rate of the policies, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we receive. The assumptions and estimates we use in connection with establishing and carrying our reserves are inherently uncertain. In addition, the sensitivity of our statutory reserves and surplus established for our variable annuity base contracts and riders to changes in the equity markets will vary depending on the magnitude of the decline. The sensitivity will be affected by the level of account values relative to the level of guaranteed amounts, product design and reinsurance. Statutory reserves for variable annuities depend upon the cumulative equity market impacts on the business in force, and therefore, result in non-linear relationships with respect to the level of equity market performance within any reporting period. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amount or the timing of the payment of actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove to be inadequate in relation to our estimated future benefits and claims. As a result, we would incur a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which we increase our reserves.  Because the equity markets and other factors impact the profitability and expected profitability of many of our products, changes in equity markets and other factors may significantly affect our business and profitability.  The fee revenue that we earn on equity-based variable annuities, unit-linked accounts, VUL insurance policies and investment advisory business is based upon account values. Because strong equity markets result in higher account values, strong equity markets positively affect our net income through increased fee revenue. Conversely, a weakening of the equity markets results in lower fee income and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources.  The increased fee revenue resulting from strong equity markets increases the expected gross profits (“EGPs”) from variable insurance products as do better than expected lapses, mortality rates and expenses. As a result, higher EGPs may result in lower net amortized costs related to deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), deferred front-end loads (“DFEL”) and changes in future contract benefits. However, a decrease in the equity markets, as well as worse than expected increases in lapses, mortality rates and expenses, depending upon their significance, may result in higher net amortized costs associated with DAC, DSI, VOBA, DFEL and changes in future contract benefits and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we reset the baseline of account values from which EGPs are projected. As a result of this and the impact of the volatile capital market conditions on our annuity reserves, we had a cumulative unfavorable prospective unlocking of $223 million, after-tax.  Changes in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affect the profitability of our products with guaranteed benefits; therefore, such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.  Certain of our variable annuity products include guaranteed benefit riders. These include GDB, GWB and GIB riders. Our GWB, GIB and 4LATER® features have elements of both insurance benefits accounted for under Statement of Position 03-1 (“SOP 03-1”) and embedded derivatives accounted for under SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements, (“SFAS 157”). The SOP 03-1 component is calculated in a manner consistent with our GDB, as described below. We weight the reserves based on the significance of their features. The amount of reserves related to GDB for variable annuities is tied to the difference between the value of the underlying accounts and the GDB, calculated using a benefit ratio approach. The GDB reserves take into account the present value of total expected GDB payments, the present value of total expected GDB assessments over the life of the contract, claims paid to date and assessments to date. Reserves for our GIB and certain GWB with lifetime benefits are based on a combination of fair value of the underlying benefit and a benefit ratio approach that is based on the projected future payments in excess of projected future account values. The benefit ratio approach takes into account the present value of total expected GIB payments, the present value of total expected GIB assessments over the life of the contract, claims paid to date and assessments to date. The amount of reserves related to those GWB that do not have lifetime benefits is based on the fair value of the underlying benefit.  Both the level of expected payments and expected total assessments used in calculating the benefit ratio are affected by the equity markets. The liabilities related to fair value are impacted by changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatility. Accordingly, strong equity markets will decrease the amount of reserves that we must carry, and strong equity markets, increases in interest rates and decreases in volatility will generally decrease the reserves calculated using fair value. Conversely, a decrease in the equity markets will increase the expected future payments used in the benefit ratio approach, which has the effect of increasing the amount of reserves. Also, a decrease in the equity market along with a decrease in interest rates and an increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the reserves calculated using fair value, which are the conditions we have experienced recently.   31    Table of Contents  Increases in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which the increase occurs. Therefore, we maintain a customized dynamic hedge program that is designed to mitigate the risks associated with income volatility around the change in reserves on guaranteed benefits. However, the hedge positions may not be effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to, among other things, the time lag between changes in their values and corresponding changes in the hedge positions, high levels of volatility in the equity markets and derivatives markets, extreme swings in interest rates, contract holder behavior different than expected and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and hedging indices. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we experienced a breakage on our guaranteed living benefits net derivatives results of $51 million and $(136) million, pre-DAC, pre-tax. Breakage is defined as the difference between the change in the value of the liabilities, excluding the amount related to the non-performance risk component, and the change in the fair value of the derivatives. The non-performance risk factor is required under SFAS 157, which requires us to consider our own credit standing, which is not hedged, in the valuation of certain of these liabilities. A decrease in our own credit spread could cause the value of these liabilities to increase, resulting in a reduction to net income. Conversely, an increase in our own credit spread could cause the value of these liabilities to decrease, resulting in an increase to net income. See “Realized Gain (Loss)” in the MD&A for further discussion.  In addition, we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay, and we are also subject to the risk that the cost of hedging these guaranteed benefits increases, resulting in a reduction to net income. These, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on net income, financial condition or liquidity.  Changes in interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and may result in increased contract withdrawals.  Because the profitability of our fixed annuity and interest-sensitive whole life, UL and fixed portion of VUL insurance business depends in part on interest rate spreads, interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect our profitability. Changes in interest rates may reduce both our profitability from spread businesses and our return on invested capital. Some of our products, principally fixed annuities, interest-sensitive whole life, UL and the fixed portion of VUL insurance, have interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our “spread,” or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the amounts we are able to earn on our general account investments intended to support our obligations under the contracts. Declines in our spread or instances where the returns on our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products could have a material adverse effect on our businesses or results of operations.  In periods of increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account with higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep our interest-sensitive products competitive. We therefore may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments then available. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general account in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and since many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative. Increases in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance products. In periods of increasing interest rates, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as contract holders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns. This process may lead to a flow of cash out of our businesses. These outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. A sudden demand among consumers to change product types or withdraw funds could lead us to sell assets at a loss to meet the demand for funds.  Our requirements to post collateral or make payments related to declines in market value of specified assets may adversely affect our liquidity and expose us to counterparty credit risk.  Many of our transactions with financial and other institutions, including settling futures positions, specify the circumstances under which the parties are required to post collateral. The amount of collateral we may be required to post under these agreements may increase under certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, under the terms of some of our transactions, we may be required to make payment to our counterparties related to any decline in the market value of the specified assets.   32    Table of Contents  Losses due to defaults by others could reduce our profitability or negatively affect the value of our investments.  Third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets may not pay or perform their obligations. These parties include the issuers whose securities we hold, borrowers under the mortgage loans we make, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers and other financial intermediaries. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure, corporate governance issues or other reasons. A further downturn in the U.S. and other economies could result in increased impairments.  Defaults on our mortgage loans and volatility in performance may adversely affect our profitability.  Our mortgage loans face default risk and are principally collateralized by commercial properties. Mortgage loans are stated on our balance sheet at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and are net of valuation allowances. We establish valuation allowances for estimated impairments as of the balance sheet date based on information, such as the market value of the underlying real estate securing the loan, any third party guarantees on the loan balance or any cross collateral agreements and their impact on expected recovery rates. As of December 31, 2008, no loans were in default for our mortgage loan investments. The performance of our mortgage loan investments, however, may fluctuate in the future. In addition, some of our mortgage loan investments have balloon payment maturities. An increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Further, any geographic or sector exposure in our mortgage loans may have adverse effects on our investment portfolios and consequently on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. While we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are exposed.  Our investments are reflected within our consolidated financial statements utilizing different accounting bases, and, accordingly, we may not have recognized differences, which may be significant, between cost and fair value in our consolidated financial statements.  Our principal investments are in fixed maturity and equity securities, mortgage loans on real estate, policy loans, short-term investments, derivative instruments, limited partnerships and other invested assets. The carrying value of such investments is as follows:     •   Fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale, except for those designated as trading securities, and are reported at their estimated fair value. The difference between the estimated fair value and amortized cost of such securities (i.e. unrealized investment gains and losses) are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss, net of adjustments to DAC, policyholder related amounts and deferred income taxes;       •   Fixed maturity and equity securities designated as trading securities, which support certain reinsurance arrangements, are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in realized gain (loss). However, offsetting the changes to fair value of the trading securities are corresponding changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the underlying reinsurance arrangement. In other words, the investment results for the trading securities, including gains and losses from sales, are passed directly to the reinsurers through the contractual terms of the reinsurance arrangements;       •   Short-term investments include investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months, at the time of acquisition and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value;       •   Mortgage loans are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, net of valuation allowances;       •   Policy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances;       •   Real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests are carried using the equity method of accounting; and       •   Other invested assets consist principally of derivatives with positive fair values. Derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in income from non-qualifying derivatives and derivatives in fair value hedging relationships. Derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships are reflected as a separate component of other comprehensive income or loss.    Investments not carried at fair value in our consolidated financial statements — principally, mortgage loans, policy loans and real estate — may have fair values which are substantially higher or lower than the carrying value reflected in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, unrealized losses are not reflected in net income unless we realize the losses by either selling the security at below amortized cost or determine that the decline in fair value is deemed to be other-than-temporary (i.e. impaired). Each of such asset classes is regularly evaluated for impairment under the accounting guidance appropriate to the respective asset class.   33    Table of Contents  Our valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities may include methodologies, estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  Fixed maturity, equity and trading securities and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represented the majority of our total cash and invested assets. Pursuant to SFAS 157, we have categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  The determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market prices is based on: valuation methodologies; securities we deem to be comparable; and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors considered in estimating fair value include coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer and quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.  During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly increasing/decreasing or high/low interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our securities, if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the current financial environment. In such cases, more securities may fall to Level 3 and thus require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, as well as valuation methods which are more sophisticated or require greater estimation, thereby resulting in values which may be less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  See Note 2 for further information about SFAS 157.  Some of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that have been experiencing significant market valuation fluctuations.  We hold certain investments that may lack liquidity, such as privately placed fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, policy loans and other limited partnership interests. These asset classes represented 25% of the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2008. Even some of our very high quality assets have been more illiquid as a result of the recent challenging market conditions.  If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with our investment portfolio, derivatives transactions or securities lending activities, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both.  The reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments, our investments in the asset classes described in the paragraph above and, at times, our high quality, generally liquid asset classes, do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset. If we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the current market, there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them and we might be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.  We invest a portion of our invested assets in investment funds, many of which make private equity investments. The amount and timing of income from such investment funds tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying investments, including private equity investments. The timing of distributions from the funds, which depends on particular events relating to the underlying investments, as well as the funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult to predict. As a result, the amount of income that we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter. Recent equity and credit market volatility may reduce investment income for these types of investments.  In addition, other external factors may cause a drop in value of investments, such as ratings downgrades on asset classes. For example, Congress has proposed legislation to amends the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to permit bankruptcy courts to modify mortgages on primary residences, including an ability to reduce outstanding mortgage balances. Such actions by bankruptcy courts may impact the ratings and valuation of our residential mortgage-backed investment securities.   34    Table of Contents  The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.  The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.  For example, the cost of our fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be other-than-temporary in the period in which the determination is made. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management’s case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value. In evaluating whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, we consider several factors including, but not limited to: our ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for a recovery in value; the cause of the decline; fundamental analysis of the liquidity, business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer; and severity of the decline in value.  Additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Another key factor in whether determining an “other-than-temporary impairment” has occurred is our intent or ability to hold to recovery or maturity. In the event that we determine that we do not have the intent or ability to hold to recovery or maturity, we are required to write down the security. A write-down is necessary even in situations where the unrealized loss is not due to an underlying credit issue, but may be solely related to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the security. Where such analysis results in a conclusion that declines in fair values are other-than-temporary, the security is written down to fair value.  Our gross unrealized losses on securities available-for-sale as of December 31, 2008, were $7.5 billion, pre-tax, and the component of gross unrealized losses for securities with a decline of 20% or more for at least six months was $5.0 billion, pre-tax. Related to our unrealized losses, we establish deferred tax assets for the tax benefit we may receive in the event that losses are realized. The realization of significant realized losses could result in an inability to recover the tax benefits and may result in the establishment of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial position.  We will be required to pay interest on our capital securities with proceeds from the issuance of qualifying securities if we fail to achieve capital adequacy or net income and stockholders’ equity levels.  We have approximately $1.6 billion in principal amount of capital securities outstanding. All of the capital securities contain covenants that require us to make interest payments in accordance with an alternative coupon satisfaction mechanism (“ACSM”) if we determine that one of the following triggers exists as of the 30th day prior to an interest payment date (“determination date”):     1.   LNL’s RBC ratio is less than 175% (based on the most recent annual financial statement filed with the State of Indiana); or       2.   (i) The sum of our consolidated net income for the four trailing fiscal quarters ending on the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter prior to the determination date is zero or negative, and (ii) our consolidated stockholders’ equity (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income and any increase in stockholders’ equity resulting from the issuance of preferred stock during a quarter) (“adjusted stockholders’ equity”) as of (x) the most recently completed quarter and (y) the end of the quarter that is two quarters before the most recently completed quarter, has declined by 10% or more as compared to the quarter that is ten fiscal quarters prior to the last completed quarter (the “benchmark quarter”).    The ACSM would generally require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy our obligation to pay interest in full on the capital securities with the net proceeds from sales of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock with an exercise price greater than the market price. We would have to utilize the ACSM until the trigger events above no longer existed, and, in the case of test 2 above, our adjusted stockholders’ equity amount has increased or has declined by less than 10% as compared to the adjusted stockholders’ equity at the end of the benchmark quarter for each interest payment date as to which interest payment restrictions were imposed by test 2 above.   35    Table of Contents  As a result of our net loss of $505 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2008, if we have net income of $232 million or less for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, we would trigger test 2(i) above with respect to the quarter ended September 30, 2009. If our adjusted stockholders’ equity at each of the quarters ended March 31 and September 30, 2009, as compared to the benchmark quarter (March 31, 2007) declines by 10% or more, we would trigger tests 2(ii)(x) and (y) above. In such a case, we would trigger the ACSM for at least our interest payments on November 17, 2009, of $28 million and January 20, 2010, of $5 million.  If we were required to utilize the ACSM and were successful in selling sufficient common shares or warrants to satisfy the interest payment, we would dilute the current holders of our common stock. Furthermore, while a trigger event is occurring and if we do not pay accrued interest in full, we may not, among other things, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock. Our failure to pay interest pursuant to the ACSM will not result in an event of default with respect to the capital securities, nor will a nonpayment of interest, unless it lasts for ten consecutive years, although such breaches may result in monetary damages to the holders of the capital securities.  The calculations of RBC, net income (loss) and adjusted stockholders’ equity are subject to adjustments and the capital securities are subject to additional terms and conditions as further described in supplemental indentures filed as exhibits to our Forms 8-K filed on March 13, 2007, May 17, 2006, and April 20, 2006.  A decrease in the capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries may result in a downgrade to our credit and insurer financial strength ratings.  In any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors — the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions), the amount of additional capital our insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth, changes in reserving requirements, such as VACARVM and principles based reserving, our inability to secure capital market solutions to provide reserve relief, such as issuing letters of credit to support captive reinsurance structures, changes in equity market levels, the value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in our investment portfolio, the value of certain derivative instruments that do not get hedge accounting, changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as changes to the NAIC RBC formulas. The RBC ratio is also affected by the product mix of the in-force book of business (i.e. the amount of business without guarantees is not subject to the same level of reserves as the business with guarantees). Most of these factors are outside of our control. Our credit and insurer financial strength ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries. The RBC ratio of LNL is an important factor in the determination of the credit and financial strength ratings of LNC and its subsidiaries. In addition, rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital we must hold in order to maintain our current ratings. In addition, in extreme scenarios of equity market declines, the amount of additional statutory reserves that we are required to hold for our variable annuity guarantees may increase at a rate greater than the rate of change of the markets. Increases in reserves reduce the statutory surplus used in calculating our RBC ratios. To the extent that our statutory capital resources are deemed to be insufficient to maintain a particular rating by one or more rating agencies, we may seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financing, which may be on terms not as favorable as in the past. Alternatively, if we were not to raise additional capital in such a scenario, either at our discretion or because we were unable to do so, our financial strength and credit ratings might be downgraded by one or more rating agencies. For more information on risks regarding our ratings, see “A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors” below.  A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors.  Nationally recognized rating agencies rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and rate our debt. Ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically, and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. In late September and early October of 2008, A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P each revised their outlook for the U.S. life insurance sector from stable to negative. We believe that the rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, may increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. In addition, actions we take to access third-party financing may in turn cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings.  Our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet contract holder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry by making it more difficult for us to market our products as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings and by leading to increased withdrawals by current customers seeking companies with higher financial strength ratings.   36    Table of Contents  This could lead to a decrease in fees as net outflows of assets increase, and therefore, result in lower fee income. Furthermore, sales of assets to meet customer withdrawal demands could also result in losses, depending on market conditions. The interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings. The recent downgrades and future downgrades of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt, including bank lines of credit, with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital. In addition, the recent downgrades and future downgrades of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries. Additional future downgrades of one or more of our ratings have become more likely as several of the ratings agencies have negative outlooks on our credit and insurer financial strength ratings. See “Item 1. Business — Ratings” for a complete description of our ratings and ratings outlook.  As a result of S&Pֹs recent downgrade of LNC’s short-term credit rating to A-2, we are not currently eligible to issue new commerical paper under the Federal Reserve’s Commercial Paper Funding Facility (“CPFF”), which we believe will make it more expensive to sell additional commercial paper, and it may make it more likely that we will have to utilize other sources of liquidity, including our credit facilities, for liquidity purposes. Prior to the downgrade, we were eligible to sell up to a maximum of $575 million to the CPFF. See “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources — Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow — Alternative Sources of Liquidity” in the MD&A for more information regarding our participation in the CPFF.  Certain blocks of our insurance business purchased from third-party insurers under indemnity reinsurance agreements may require us to place assets in trust, secure letters of credit or return the business, if the financial strength ratings and/or capital ratios of certain insurance subsidiaries are not maintained at specified levels.  Under certain indemnity reinsurance agreements, one of our insurance subsidiaries, LLANY, provides 100% indemnity reinsurance for the business assumed, however, the third-party insurer (the “cedent”) remains primarily liable on the underlying insurance business. Under these types of agreements, at December 31, 2008, we held statutory reserves of approximately $3.5 billion. These indemnity reinsurance arrangements require that our subsidiary, as the reinsurer, maintain certain insurer financial strength ratings and capital ratios. If these ratings or capital ratios are not maintained, depending upon the reinsurance agreement, the cedent may recapture the business, or require us to place assets in trust or provide letters of credit at least equal to the relevant statutory reserves. Under the largest indemnity reinsurance arrangement, we held approximately $2.4 billion of statutory reserves at December 31, 2008. LLANY must maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least B+, an S&P financial strength rating of at least BB+ and a Moody’s financial strength rating of at least Ba1, as well as maintain a RBC ratio of at least 160% or an S&P capital adequacy ratio of 100%, or the cedent may recapture the business. Under two other arrangements, by which we established approximately $1 billion of statutory reserves, LLANY must maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of at least B++, an S&P financial strength rating of at least BBB- and a Moody’s financial strength rating of at least Baa3. One of these arrangements also requires LLANY to maintain an RBC ratio of at least 185% or an S&P capital adequacy ratio of 115%. Each of these arrangements may require LLANY to place assets in trust equal to the relevant statutory reserves. As of December 31, 2008, LLANY’s RBC ratio exceeded 500%. See “Item 1. Business — Ratings” for a complete description of LLANY’s ratings.  If the cedent recaptured the business, LLANY would be required to release reserves and transfer assets to the cedent. Such a recapture could adversely impact our future profits. Alternatively, if LLANY established a security trust for the cedent, the ability to transfer assets out of the trust could be severely restricted, thus negatively impacting our liquidity.  Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. The supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition. The primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments. This system of supervision and regulation covers, among other things:     •   Standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency, including RBC measurements;       •   Restrictions of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates;       •   Restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;       •   Restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations;       •   Limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay;       •   The existence and licensing status of the company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business;       •   Certain required methods of accounting;       •   Reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and       •   Assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies.     37    Table of Contents     We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit such authorities to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company. As of December 31, 2008, no state insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us any substantial fines or revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order of supervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  In addition, Lincoln Financial Network and Lincoln Financial Distributors, as well as our variable annuities and variable life insurance products, are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC and the FINRA. Our Investment Management segment is subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, the FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and jurisdictions of the states, territories and foreign countries in which they are licensed to do business. Lincoln UK is subject to regulation by the FSA in the U.K. LNC, as a savings and loan holding company and Newton County Loan and Savings, FSB, are subject to regulation and supervision by the Office of Thrift Supervision. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and self-regulatory organizations broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the subsidiaries from carrying on their businesses in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Finally, our radio operations require a license, subject to periodic renewal, from the Federal Communications Commission to operate. While management considers the likelihood of a failure to renew remote, any station that fails to receive renewal would be forced to cease operations.  Many of the foregoing regulatory or governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees. In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of our businesses by these bodies, which has included more extensive examinations, regular “sweep” inquiries and more detailed review of disclosure documents. These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Attempts to mitigate the impact of Regulation XXX and Actuarial Guideline 38 may fail in whole or in part resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  The Model Regulation entitled “Valuation of Life Insurance Policies,” commonly known as “Regulation XXX” or “XXX,” requires insurers to establish additional statutory reserves for term life insurance policies with long-term premium guarantees and UL policies with secondary guarantees. In addition, Actuarial Guideline 38 (“AG38”) clarifies the application of XXX with respect to certain UL insurance policies with secondary guarantees. Virtually all of our newly issued term and the great majority of our newly issued UL insurance products are now affected by XXX and AG38.  As a result of this regulation, we have established higher statutory reserves for term and UL insurance products and changed our premium rates for term life insurance products. We also have implemented reinsurance and capital management actions to mitigate the capital impact of XXX and AG38, including the use of letters of credit to support the reinsurance provided by a captive reinsurance subsidiary. However, we cannot provide assurance that there will not be regulatory, rating agency or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date. The result of those potential challenges could require us to increase statutory reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. Any change to or repeal of XXX or AG38 could reduce the competitive advantage of our reinsurance and capital management actions and could adversely affect our market position in the life insurance market. In addition, as a result of current capital market conditions and disruption in the credit markets, our ability to secure additional letters of credit or to secure them at current costs may impact the profitability of term and UL insurance products. See “Part II - Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow — Subsidiaries” for a further discussion of our capital management in connection with XXX.   38    Table of Contents  In light of the current downturn in the credit markets and the increased spreads on asset-backed debt securities, we also cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to implement actions to mitigate the impact of XXX or AG38 on future sales of term and UL insurance products. If we are unable to continue to implement those actions, we may be required to increase statutory reserves, incur higher operating costs and lower returns on products sold than we currently anticipate or reduce our sales of these products. We also may have to implement measures that may be disruptive to our business. For example, because term and UL insurance are particularly price-sensitive products, any increase in premiums charged on these products in order to compensate us for the increased statutory reserve requirements or higher costs of reinsurance may result in a significant loss of volume and adversely affect our life insurance operations.  A drop in the rankings of the mutual funds that we manage, as well as a loss of key portfolio managers, could result in lower advisory fees.  While mutual funds are not rated, per se, many industry periodicals and services, such as Lipper, provide rankings of mutual fund performance. These rankings often have an impact on the decisions of customers regarding which mutual funds to invest in. If the rankings of the mutual funds for which we provide advisory services decrease materially, the funds’ assets may decrease as customers leave for funds with higher performance rankings. Similarly, a loss of our key portfolio managers who manage mutual fund investments could result in poorer fund performance, as well as customers leaving these mutual funds for new mutual funds managed by the portfolio managers. Any loss of fund assets would decrease the advisory fees that we earn from such mutual funds, which are generally tied to the amount of fund assets and performance. This would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.  Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses.  We are, and in the future may be, subject to legal actions in the ordinary course of our insurance and investment management operations, both domestically and internationally. Pending legal actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the businesses in which we operate. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which in turn could materially harm our business prospects. For more information on pending material legal proceedings, see “Regulatory and Litigation Matters” in Note 14 for a description of our reportable litigation.  Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could increase our tax costs.  Changes to the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income. In this regard, on August 16, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a revenue ruling which purports, among other things, to modify the calculation of separate account deduction for dividends received by life insurance companies. Subsequently, the IRS issued another revenue ruling that suspended the August 16, 2007, ruling and announced a new regulation project on the issue. Our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008, included a separate account dividend received deduction benefit of $81 million.  Our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our businesses or result in losses.  We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective. Many of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models. As a result, these methods may not predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate, such as the risk of pandemics causing a large number of deaths. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.   39    Table of Contents  We face a risk of non-collectibility of reinsurance, which could materially affect our results of operations.  We follow the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance subsidiaries (known as ceding). As of December 31, 2008, we have ceded approximately $347 billion of life insurance in force to reinsurers for reinsurance protection. Although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay contract holders for losses insured under the policies we issue, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk. As of December 31, 2008, we had $8.5 billion of reinsurance receivables from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses, for which they are obligated to reimburse us under our reinsurance contracts. Of this amount, $4.5 billion relates to the sale of our reinsurance business to Swiss Re in 2001 through an indemnity reinsurance agreement. Swiss Re has funded a trust to support this business. The balance in the trust changes as a result of ongoing reinsurance activity and was $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2008. In addition, should Swiss Re’s financial strength ratings drop below either S&P AA- or A.M. Best A, or their NAIC RBC ratio fall below 250%, assets equal to the reserves supporting business reinsured must be placed into a trust according to pre-established asset quality guidelines. Furthermore, approximately $2.0 billion of the Swiss Re treaties are funds withheld structures where we have a right of offset on assets backing the reinsurance receivables.  Included in the business sold to Swiss Re through indemnity reinsurance in 2001 was disability income business. See further discussion of this business in “Reinsurance” in the MD&A.  The balance of the reinsurance is due from a diverse group of reinsurers. The collectibility of reinsurance is largely a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. We perform annual credit reviews on our reinsurers, focusing on, among other things, financial capacity, stability, trends and commitment to the reinsurance business. We also require assets in trust, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions. Despite these measures, a reinsurer’s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract, especially Swiss Re, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Significant adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of, or higher prices for, reinsurance.  We reinsure a significant amount of the mortality risk on fully underwritten, newly issued, individual life insurance contracts. We regularly review retention limits for continued appropriateness and they may be changed in the future. If we were to experience adverse mortality or morbidity experience, a significant portion of that would be reimbursed by our reinsurers. Prolonged or severe adverse mortality or morbidity experience could result in increased reinsurance costs, and ultimately, reinsurers not willing to offer coverage. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient, we would either have to be willing to accept an increase in our net exposures or revise our pricing to reflect higher reinsurance premiums. If this were to occur, we may be exposed to reduced profitability and cash flow strain or we may not be able to price new business at competitive rates.  Catastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for contract holder claims and the availability of reinsurance.  Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic, an act of terrorism or other event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries. Significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century, but the likelihood, timing or severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted. In our group insurance operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.  The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes and man-made catastrophes, including terrorism, may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. Also, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Accordingly, our ability to write new business could also be affected.  Consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established or applicable reinsurance will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities, and a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   40    Table of Contents  We may be unable to attract and retain sales representatives and other employees and independent contractors, particularly financial advisors.  We compete to attract and retain financial advisors, wholesalers, portfolio managers and other employees and independent contractors, as well as independent distributors of our products. Intense competition exists for persons and independent distributors with demonstrated ability. We compete with other financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products, compensation, support services and financial position. Sales in our businesses and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining financial advisors, wholesalers, portfolio managers and other employees, as well as independent distributors of our products.  Our sales representatives are not captive and may sell products of our competitors.  We sell our annuity and life insurance products through independent sales representatives. These representatives are not captive, which means they may also sell our competitors’ products. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours, or pay higher commission rates to the sales representatives than we do, these representatives may concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors’ products instead of ours.  We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.  We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.  We also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another party’s intellectual property rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services. Any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages. If we were found to have infringed a third-party patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.  Our businesses are intensely competitive. We compete based on a number of factors, including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice, investment performance, product features, price, perceived financial strength and claims-paying and credit ratings. Our competitors include insurers, broker-dealers, financial advisors, asset managers and other financial institutions. A number of our business units face competitors that have greater market share, offer a broader range of products or have higher financial strength or credit ratings than we do.  In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized financial services firms. Many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. Furthermore, larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. We expect consolidation to continue and perhaps accelerate in the future, thereby increasing competitive pressure on us.   41    Table of Contents  Anti-takeover provisions could delay, deter or prevent our change in control, even if the change in control would be beneficial to LNC shareholders.  We are an Indiana corporation subject to Indiana state law. Certain provisions of Indiana law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us. Also, provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and other agreements to which we are a party could delay, deter or prevent our change in control, even if a change in control would be beneficial to shareholders. In addition, under Indiana law, directors may, in considering the best interests of a corporation, consider the effects of any action on stockholders, employees, suppliers and customers of the corporation and the communities in which offices and other facilities are located, and other factors the directors consider pertinent. One statutory provision prohibits, except under specified circumstances, LNC from engaging in any business combination with any shareholder who owns 10% or more of our common stock (which shareholder, under the statute, would be considered an “interested shareholder”) for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless such business combination is approved by the board of directors prior to such person becoming an interested shareholder. In addition, our articles of incorporation contain a provision requiring holders of at least three-fourths of our voting shares then outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting together, to approve a transaction with an interested shareholder rather than the simple majority required under Indiana law.  In addition to the anti-takeover provisions of Indiana law, there are other factors that may delay, deter or prevent our change in control. As an insurance holding company, we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled. The insurance holding company acts and regulations restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes and regulations, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company, or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company or insurance company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. Similarly, as a result of its ownership of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, LNC is considered to be a savings and loan holding company. Federal banking laws generally provide that no person may acquire control of LNC, and gain indirect control of Newton County Loan & Savings, FSB, without prior regulatory approval. Generally, beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of LNC would be presumed to constitute control.     Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
