Our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements (“Notes”) are presented in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”       Item 1. Business   OVERVIEW  Lincoln National Corporation (“LNC” which also may be referred to as “Lincoln,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a holding company, which operates multiple insurance and investment management businesses through subsidiary companies. Through our business segments, we sell a wide range of wealth protection, accumulation and retirement income products and solutions. These products include institutional and/or retail fixed and indexed annuities, variable annuities, universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, term life insurance, mutual funds and managed accounts. LNC was organized under the laws of the state of Indiana in 1968. We currently maintain our principal executive offices in Radnor, Pennsylvania, which were previously located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “Lincoln Financial Group” is the marketing name for LNC and its subsidiary companies. As of December 31, 2007, LNC had consolidated assets of $191.4 billion and consolidated stockholders’ equity of $11.7 billion.  We provide products and services in four operating businesses and report results through six business segments, as follows:      (1) Individual Markets, which includes the Annuities and Life Insurance segments,      (2) Employer Markets, which includes the Retirement Products and Group Protection segments,      (3) Investment Management, which is an operating business and segment, and      (4) Lincoln UK, which is an operating business and segment.  We also have Other Operations, which includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments, unallocated corporate items (such as investment income on investments related to the amount of statutory surplus in our insurance subsidiaries that is not allocated to our business units and other corporate investments, interest expense on short-term and long-term borrowings, and certain expenses, including restructuring and merger-related expenses) and the ongoing amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity reinsurance portion of the sale of our former reinsurance segment to Swiss Re Life & Health America Inc. (“Swiss Re”) in the fourth quarter of 2001.  In addition, as a result of our agreements dated as of November 12, 2007 to divest the television stations, sports programming and certain radio properties of our former Lincoln Financial Media segment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, we are reporting the results of those businesses as discontinued operations in all periods presented, and the results of the remaining radio properties are included in Other Operations. These remaining businesses do not qualify as discontinued operations. For further information, see “Acquisition and Dispositions” below.  The results of Lincoln Financial Network (“LFN”) and Lincoln Financial Distributors (“LFD”), our retail and wholesale distributors, are included in the segments for which they distribute products. LFD distributes our individual products and services primarily through brokers, planners, agents and other intermediaries. As of December 31, 2007, LFD had approximately 650 internal and external wholesalers (including sales managers). The Employer Markets group distributes the employer products and services primarily through financial advisors, employee benefit brokers, third party administrators, and other employee benefit firms. As of December 31, 2007, LFN offered LNC and non-proprietary products and advisory services through a national network of approximately 7,300 active producers who placed business with us within the last twelve months.  Financial information in the tables that follow is presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), unless otherwise indicated. As a result of our agreements to divest a portion of our media businesses in 2007, we changed the composition of our segments and restated the prior periods’ segment financial information to conform to the 2007 presentation. We provide revenues, income (loss) from operations and assets attributable to each of our business segments and Other Operations as well as revenues derived inside and outside the U.S. for the last three fiscal years in Note 20.    1    Table of Contents Revenues by segment (in millions) were as follows:                        For the Years EndedDecember 31,        2007     2006     2005     Operating revenues:                  Individual Markets:                  Annuities   $ 2,600     $ 2,161     $ 1,422     Life Insurance     3,921       3,256       1,911                               Total Individual Markets     6,521       5,417       3,333                               Employer Markets:                  Retirement Products     1,441       1,360       1,175     Group Protection     1,500       1,032       —                               Total Employer Markets     2,941       2,392       1,175                               Investment Management     590       564       475     Lincoln UK     370       308       318     Other Operations     281       283       175     Realized loss     (118 )     (3 )     (3 )   Amortization of deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance related to reserve developments     9       1       2                               Total revenues   $ 10,594     $ 8,962     $ 5,475                              Acquisition and Dispositions  On November 12, 2007, Lincoln Financial Media Company (“LFMC”), our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into two stock purchase agreements with Raycom Holdings, LLC (“Raycom”). Pursuant to one of the agreements, LFMC has agreed to sell to Raycom all of the outstanding capital stock of three of LFMC’s wholly owned subsidiaries: (i) WBTV, Inc., the owner and operator of television station WBTV, Charlotte, North Carolina; (ii) WCSC, Inc., the owner and operator of television station WCSC, Charleston, South Carolina; and (iii) WWBT, Inc., the owner and operator of television station WWBT, Richmond, Virginia. Upon the closing of the transaction, LFMC expects to receive proceeds of $548 million, subject to certain adjustments. We expect to close during the first quarter of 2008. Pursuant to the other agreement, LFMC agreed to sell to Raycom all of the outstanding capital stock of Lincoln Financial Sports, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of LFMC. This transaction closed on November 30, 2007 and LFMC received $42 million of proceeds.  On November 12, 2007, LFMC also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Greater Media, Inc., to sell all of the outstanding capital stock of Lincoln Financial Media Company of North Carolina, the owner and operator of radio stations WBT(AM), Charlotte, North Carolina, WBT-FM, Chester, South Carolina and WLNK(FM), Charlotte, North Carolina. This transaction closed on January 31, 2008, and LFMC received proceeds of $100 million. More information on these LFMC transactions can be found in our Form 8-K filed on November 14, 2007 and in “Acquisition and Dispositions” in the MD&A.  During the fourth quarter of 2007, we sold certain institutional taxable fixed income business to an unaffiliated investment management company. Investment Management transferred $12.3 billion of assets under management as part of this transaction. Based upon the assets transferred as of October 31, 2007, the purchase price is expected to be no more than $49 million. We expect this transaction to decrease income from operations, relative to 2007, by approximately $3 million, after-tax, per quarter in 2008. During the fourth quarter we received $25 million of the purchase price, with additional scheduled payments over the next three years. We recorded an after-tax realized loss of $2 million on our Consolidated Statements of Income as a result of this transaction. There were certain other pipeline accounts in process at the time of the transaction closing, and any adjustment to the purchase price, if necessary, will be determined at October 31, 2008. Investment Management manages approximately $94.0 billion of fixed income assets with a team of 100 fixed income investment professionals. The transaction did not impact the fixed income team that manages our fixed income mutual funds or general account assets.  On April 3, 2006, we completed our merger with Jefferson-Pilot Corporation (“Jefferson-Pilot”), pursuant to which Jefferson-Pilot merged into one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Jefferson-Pilot, through its subsidiaries, offered full lines of individual life, annuity and investment products, and group life insurance products, disability income and dental contracts, and it operated television and radio stations.  In September 2004, we completed the sale of our London-based international investment unit, Delaware International Advisors Ltd. (“DIAL”), to a newly-formed company associated with DIAL’s management and a private-equity firm. At closing, we     2    Table of Contents  received $181 million in cash and relief of certain obligations of approximately $19 million. We had an after-tax gain from the transaction of $46 million. DIAL, which has since been renamed Mondrian Investment Partners (“Mondrian”), continues to provide sub-advisory services with respect to certain international asset classes for our Investment Management segment and LNC.  For further information about acquisitions and divestitures, see “Acquisition and Dispositions” in the MD&A and Note 3.  Branding  Branding is a key element of our strategy. Our branding efforts are focused on three primary target audiences: financial intermediaries; affluent consumers (top 11% of the population); and plan sponsors. Through our branding efforts, we work to build name awareness and brand familiarity.  In 2007, we continued to build our brand on a national basis through an integrated package of consumer print and television, trade print and online advertising, sponsorships, marketing, public relations and promotional events. As a result, we believe that our awareness among our core target audiences continues to be strong.  We recognize that our brand embodies the experience our customers have with us. Steps were taken in 2007 to identify and closely link the various channels of brand including customer touchpoint areas, Marketing, Advertising, Public Affairs, Investor Relations, Government Relations, Community Relations, Corporate Communications and affiliated media companies. Major brand initiatives across these channels include a customer touchpoint audit, an internal brand campaign that targets customer-facing employees, and a media campaign. In addition, we launched a new brand advertising campaign and consumer facing website. All of these efforts are focused on the Retirement Income Security strategy.   BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND OTHER OPERATIONS   INDIVIDUAL MARKETS  Overview  The Individual Markets business provides its products through two segments: Annuities and Life Insurance. The Annuities segment provides tax-deferred growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering individual fixed annuities, including indexed annuities, and variable annuities. Its variable annuities are distributed by affiliated and unaffiliated broker-dealers. The Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through both individual and survivorship versions of universal life and variable universal life, as well as term insurance and a linked-benefit product (which is a universal life insurance policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs).  During 2007, the Individual Markets business launched its “Unified Product Portfolio” (“UPP”), a wide array of life insurance and annuity products. The UPP combines and improves upon the product suites, system platforms and product development of LNC and Jefferson-Pilot into a more streamlined and rationalized range of products.   Individual Markets – Annuities  Overview  The Annuities segment, with principal operations in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Hartford, Connecticut, and Greensboro, North Carolina, and additional operations in Concord, New Hampshire, provides tax-deferred growth and lifetime income opportunities for its clients by offering fixed and variable annuities. As a result of a broad product portfolio and a strong and diverse distribution network, we ranked 7th in assets and 5th in individual and group contract variable annuity flows for the year ended December 31, 2007 in the U.S., according to Morningstar Annuity Research Center.  The Annuities segment offers non-qualified and qualified fixed and variable annuities to individuals. The “fixed” and “variable” classification describes whether we or the contract holders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the contract. This also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products, either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable products.  Annuities are attractive because they provide tax-deferred growth in the underlying principal, thereby deferring the tax consequences of the growth in value until withdrawals are made from the accumulation values, often at lower tax rates occurring during retirement. In addition to favorable tax treatment, annuities are unique in that contract holders can select a variety of payout alternatives to help provide an income flow for life. The individual annuities market has seen an increase in competition along with new product types and promotion. The guarantee features (living and death benefits) offered within an annuity are not found in any other investment vehicle, and, we believe, make annuities attractive especially in times of economic uncertainty.    3    Table of Contents Products  In general, an annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual or group in which the insurance company, after receipt of one or more premium payments, agrees to pay an amount of money either in one lump sum or on a periodic basis (i.e., annually, semi-annually, quarterly or monthly), beginning on a certain date and continuing for a period of time as specified in the contract. Periodic payments can begin within twelve months after the premium is received (referred to as an immediate annuity) or at a future date in time (referred to as a deferred annuity). This retirement vehicle helps protect an individual from outliving his or her money and can be either a fixed annuity or a variable annuity.  The Annuities segment’s deposits (in millions) were as follows:                     For the Years EndedDecember 31,      2007   2006   2005   Variable portion of variable annuity   $ 9,135   $ 7,251   $ 5,539   Fixed portion of variable annuity     2,795     2,090     1,871                       Total variable annuity     11,930     9,341     7,410   Fixed indexed annuity     755     717     —   Other fixed annuity     772     698     118                       Total deposits   $ 13,457   $ 10,756   $ 7,528                      Variable Annuities  A variable annuity provides the contract holder the ability to direct the investment of premium deposits into one or more sub-accounts offered through the product (“variable portion”) or into a fixed account with a guaranteed return (“fixed portion”). The value of the variable portion of the contract holder’s account varies with the performance of the underlying sub-accounts chosen by the contract holder. The underlying assets of the sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance series of mutual funds. The contract holder’s return is tied to the performance of the segregated assets underlying the variable annuity, (i.e. the contract holder bears the investment risk associated with these investments), except for the impact of guaranteed benefit features. The value of the fixed portion is guaranteed by us and recorded in our general account liabilities. Variable annuity account values were $62.1 billion, $51.8 billion and $41.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, including the fixed portions of variable accounts of $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.9 billion, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  We charge mortality and expense assessments and administrative fees on variable annuity accounts to cover insurance and administrative expenses. These assessments are built into accumulation unit values, which when multiplied by the number of units owned for any sub-account equals the contract holder’s account value for that sub-account. The fees that we earn from these contracts are reported as insurance fees on the income statement. In addition, for some contracts, we collect surrender charges that range from 0% to 10% of withdrawals when contract holders surrender their contracts during the surrender charge period, which is generally higher during the early years of a contract. Our individual variable annuity products have a maximum surrender charge period of ten years.  We offer A-share, B-share, C-share, L-share and bonus variable annuities, although not with every annuity product. The differences in these relate to the sales charge and fee structure associated with the contract.      •    An A-share has a front-end sales charge and no back-end contingent deferred sales charge, also known as a surrender charge. The net premium (premium less front-end charge) is invested in the contract, resulting in full liquidity and lower mortality and expense assessments over the long term than those in other share classes.      •    A B-share has a seven-year surrender charge that is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract’s specified surrender charge period. The entire premium is invested in the contract, but it offers limited liquidity during the surrender charge period.      •    A C-share has no front-end sales charge or back-end surrender charge. Accordingly, it offers maximum liquidity but mortality and expense assessments are higher than those for A-share or B-share. It offers a persistency credit in year eight to revert pricing to B-share levels.      •    An L-share has a four to five year surrender charge that is only paid if the account is surrendered or withdrawals are in excess of contractual free withdrawals within the contract’s specified surrender charge period. The differences between the L-share and the B-share are the length of the surrender charge period and the fee structure. L-shares have a shorter surrender charge period, so for the added liquidity, mortality and expense assessments are higher. We offer L-share annuity products with persistency credits beginning in years five or eight to revert pricing back to B-share levels.   4    Table of Contents   •    A bonus annuity is a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus credit to a contract based on a specified percentage (typically ranging from 2% to 5%) of each deposit. The entire premium plus the bonus are invested in the sub-accounts supporting the contract. It has a seven to nine-year surrender charge. The expenses are slightly more than those for a B-share. We also offer bonus annuity products with persistency credits beginning in years eight or fifteen to revert bonus pricing back to B-share pricing levels.  Certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefit features, such as a guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”), a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”), a guaranteed income benefit (“GIB”) and a combination of such benefits. Most of our variable annuity products also offer the choice of a fixed option that provides for guaranteed interest credited to the account value.  Approximately 91%, 91% and 90% of variable annuity separate account values had a GMDB feature as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The GMDB features include those where we contractually guarantee to the contract holder that upon death, we will return no less than: (a) the total deposits made to the contract adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals; (b) the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted to reflect any partial withdrawals following the contract anniversary; or (c) the current contract value plus an additional amount, either 40% or 25% of contract gains, to help offset the impact of taxes.  The Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage benefit is a GMWB feature that offers the contract holder a guarantee equal to the initial deposit (or contract value, if elected after issue), adjusted for any subsequent purchase payments or withdrawals. There are two elective step-up options: a one-year option and a five-year option. In general, the one-year option allows an owner to step up the guarantee amount automatically on the benefit anniversary to the current contract value, and the five-year option allows the owner to step up the guarantee amount to the current contract value on or after the fifth anniversary of the election or of the most recent step up. In each case, the contract value must be greater than the guarantee amount at the time of step up. To receive the full amount of the guarantee, annual withdrawals are limited to either 5% of the guaranteed amount for the one-year option or 7% of the guaranteed amount for the five-year option. Under the one-year option, withdrawals will continue for the rest of the owner’s life (“single life version”) or the life of the owner or owner’s spouse (“joint life version”) as long as withdrawals begin after attained age 65 and are limited to 5% of the guaranteed amount. Withdrawals in excess of the applicable maximum in any contract year are assessed any applicable surrender charges, and the guaranteed amount is recalculated. Approximately 31%, 26% and 21% of variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, had a GMWB feature.  We offer other product riders including i4LIFE® Advantage and 4LATER®. The i4LIFE® feature, on which we have received a U.S. patent, allows variable annuity contract holders access and control during the income distribution phase of their contract. This added flexibility allows the contract holder to access the account value for transfers, additional withdrawals, and other service features like portfolio rebalancing. In general, GIB is an optional feature available with i4LIFE® Advantage that guarantees regular income payments will not fall below 75% of the highest income payment on a specified anniversary date (reduced for any subsequent withdrawals). Approximately 88%, 83% and 72% of i4LIFE® Advantage account values elected the GIB feature as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately 9%, 6% and 4% of variable annuity account values as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, have elected an i4LIFE® feature. 4LATER® provides a minimum income base used to determine the GIB floor when a client begins income payments under i4LIFE®. The income base is equal to the initial deposit (or contract value, if elected after issue) and increases by 15% every three years (subject to a 200% cap). The owner may step up the income base on or after the third anniversary of rider election or of the most recent step-up (which also resets the 200% cap).  To mitigate the increased risks associated with guaranteed benefits, we developed a dynamic hedging program. The customized dynamic hedging program uses equity and interest rate futures positions, interest rate and variance swaps, as well as equity-based options depending upon the risks underlying the guarantees. Our program is designed to offset both positive and negative changes in the carrying value of the guarantees. However, while we actively manage these hedge positions, the hedge positions may not be effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to, among other things, the time lag between changes in their values and corresponding changes in the hedge positions, high levels of volatility in the equity markets, contract holder behavior, and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and hedging indices. For more information on our hedging program, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Derivatives” of the MD&A. For information regarding risks related to guaranteed benefits, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”  Fixed Annuities  A fixed annuity preserves the principal value of the contract while guaranteeing a minimum interest rate to be credited to the accumulation value. We offer single and flexible premium fixed deferred annuities to the individual annuities market. Single premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow only a single premium to be paid. Flexible premium fixed deferred annuities are contracts that allow multiple premium payments on either a scheduled or non-scheduled basis. Our fixed annuities include both traditional fixed-rate and fixed indexed annuities. With fixed deferred annuities, the contract holder has the right to surrender the contract and receive the current accumulation value less any applicable surrender charge and, if applicable, a market value adjustment (“MVA”).    5    Table of Contents Fixed indexed annuities allow the contract holder to elect an interest rate linked to the performance of the S&P 500 Index®. The indexed interest rate is guaranteed never to be less than zero. Our fixed indexed annuities provide contract holders a choice of a traditional fixed-rate account and one or more different indexed accounts. A contract holder may elect to change allocations at renewal dates, either annually or biannually. At each renewal date, we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed component (i.e. reset the caps, spreads or participation rates), subject to guarantees.  Fixed annuity contracts are general account obligations. We bear the investment risk for fixed annuity contracts. To protect from premature withdrawals, we impose surrender charges. Surrender charges are typically applicable during the early years of the annuity contract, with a declining level of surrender charges over time. We expect to earn a spread between what we earn on the underlying general account investments supporting the fixed annuity product line and what we credit to our fixed annuity contract holders’ accounts. In addition, with respect to fixed indexed annuities, we purchase options that are highly correlated to the indexed account allocation decisions of our contract holders, such that we are closely hedged with respect to indexed interest for the current reset period. For more information on our hedging program for fixed indexed annuities, see “Critical Accounting Policies” of the MD&A.  Individual fixed annuity account values were $14.4 billion, $14.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately $10.5 billion of individual fixed annuity account values as of December 31, 2007 were still within the surrender charge period. However, certain fixed annuities allow window periods during which contract holders can withdraw their funds without incurring a surrender charge. For example, our StepFive® Fixed Annuity has a sixty-day window period following each five-year fixed guarantee period. Crediting rates for each subsequent five-year fixed guarantee period are set at the beginning of the window period. During the window period, account holders can withdraw their funds without incurring a surrender charge. Account values for this type of product were $4.2 billion, $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, with approximately $736 million of account values entering the window period during 2008.  Our fixed annuity product offerings as of December 31, 2007 consisted of traditional fixed-rate and fixed indexed deferred annuities. We also offer fixed-rate immediate annuities with various payment options, including lifetime incomes. In addition to traditional fixed-rate immediate annuities, we introduced in 2007 Lincoln SmartIncomeSM Inflation Annuity. This product provides lifetime income with annual adjustments to keep pace with inflation. It uses a patent-pending design to preserve access to remaining principal, also adjusted annually for inflation, for premature death or unexpected needs. The traditional fixed-rate deferred annuity products include the Lincoln ClassicSM (Single and Flexible Premium), Lincoln SelectSM and Lincoln ChoicePlusSM Fixed annuities. The fixed indexed deferred annuity products include the Lincoln OptiPoint®, Lincoln OptiChoice®, Lincoln New Directions®, and Lincoln Future Point® annuities. The fixed indexed annuities offer one or more of the following indexed accounts:       •    The Performance Triggered Indexed Account pays a specified rate, declared at the beginning of the indexed term, if the S&P 500 Index® value at the end of the indexed term is the same or greater than the S&P 500 Index® value at the beginning of the indexed term.       •    The Point to Point Indexed Account compares the value of the S&P 500 Index® at the end of the indexed term to the S&P 500 Index® value at the beginning of the term. If the S&P 500 Index® at the end of the indexed term is higher than the S&P 500 Index® value at the beginning of the term, then the percentage change, up to the declared indexed interest cap, is credited to the indexed account.       •    The Monthly Cap Indexed Account reflects the monthly changes in the S&P 500 Index® value over the course of the indexed term. Each month, the percentage change in the S&P 500 Index® value is calculated, subject to a monthly indexed cap that is declared at the beginning of the indexed term. At the end of the indexed term, all of the monthly change percentages are summed to determine the rate of indexed interest that will be credited to the account.       •    The Monthly Average Indexed Account compares the average monthly value of the S&P 500 Index® to the S&P 500 Index® value at the beginning of the term. The average of the S&P 500 Index® values at the end of each of the twelve months in the indexed term is calculated. The percentage change of the average S&P 500 Index® value to the starting S&P 500 Index® value is calculated. From that amount, the indexed interest spread, which is declared at the beginning of the indexed term, is subtracted. The resulting rate is used to calculate the indexed interest that will be credited to the account.  If the S&P 500 Index® values produce a negative indexed interest rate, no indexed interest is credited to the indexed account.  We introduced the Lincoln Living IncomeSM Advantage in 2007. Available with certain of our fixed indexed annuities, it provides the contract holder a guaranteed minimum lifetime withdrawal benefit. Withdrawals in excess of the guaranteed amount are assessed any applicable surrender charges, and the guaranteed withdrawal amount is recalculated.  Many of our fixed annuities have an MVA. If a contract with an MVA is surrendered during the surrender charge period, both a surrender charge and an MVA may be applied. The MVA feature increases or decreases the contract value of the annuity based on a decrease or increase in interest rates. Individual fixed annuities with an MVA feature constituted 29%, 24% and 11% of total fixed annuity account values as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.    6    Table of Contents Distribution  The Annuities segment distributes all its individual fixed and variable annuity products through LFD, our wholesaling distribution organization. LFD’s distribution channels give the Annuities segment access to its target markets. LFD distributes the segment’s products to a large number of financial intermediaries, including LFN. The financial intermediaries include wire/regional firms, independent financial planners, financial institutions and managing general agents.  Competition  The annuities market is very competitive and consists of many companies, with no one company dominating the market for all products. The Annuities segment competes with numerous other financial services companies. The main factors upon which entities in this market compete are distribution channel access and the quality of wholesalers, investment performance, cost, product features, speed to market, brand recognition, financial strength ratings, crediting rates and client service.  We believe that the Annuities segment’s high service levels help it to compete in the annuities market. We track the time to answer calls to the center as well as the average response time to customer queries. Further, the segment tracks the turnaround time for various customer services such as processing of applications.  The Annuities segment attempts to design products that meet the needs of clients in its markets. The speed in which the segment’s products reach the market is, from concept of the product to launch, six to nine months. Over the last five years, the segment has announced several new products and product features to the market in response to the evolving nature of the annuities market.   Individual Markets – Life Insurance  Overview  The Life Insurance segment, with principal operations in Greensboro, North Carolina, and Hartford, Connecticut and additional operations in Concord, New Hampshire and Fort Wayne, Indiana, focuses on the creation and protection of wealth for its clients through the manufacturing of life insurance products. The Life Insurance segment offers wealth protection and transfer opportunities through term insurance, a linked-benefit product (which is a universal life insurance policy linked with riders that provide for long-term care costs) and both single and survivorship versions of universal life (“UL”) and variable universal life (“VUL”).  The Life Insurance segment primarily targets the affluent to high net worth markets, defined as households with at least $250,000 of financial assets. For those individual policies we sold in 2007, the average face amount (excluding term and MoneyGuard®) was $1 million and average first year premiums paid were approximately $58,000.  Products  The Life Insurance segment sells primarily interest/market-sensitive products (UL and VUL) and term products. The segment’s sales (in millions) were as follows:                     For the Years Ended December 31,      2007   2006   2005   Universal Life:               Excluding MoneyGuard ®   $ 597   $ 436   $ 192   MoneyGuard ®     40     31     34                       Total Universal Life     637     467     226   Variable Universal Life     77     61     42   Term/Whole Life     32     43     36                       Total sales   $ 746   $ 571   $ 304                      UL and VUL sales represent target premium plus 5% of excess premium (including adjustments for internal replacements at 50%); whole life and term sales throughout the presentation represent 100% of first year paid premium; and linked-benefit sales represent 15% of premium deposits.    7    Table of Contents Due to some seasonality, we generally have higher sales in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. Approximately 41% and 46% of total sales were in the first half of 2006 and 2005, with the remainder occurring in the second half of the year for the same periods. However in 2007, approximately 51% of total sales were in the first half of 2007 due to the transition of our product portfolio to the new UPP.  In addition, the following table shows life policies’ face amount in force (in millions):                     As of December 31,      2007   2006   2005   Universal Life and other   $ 284,305   $ 267,228   $ 128,792   Term Insurance     235,919     234,148     187,849                       Total in-force face amount   $ 520,224   $ 501,376   $ 316,641                      Mortality margins, morbidity margins (for linked-benefit products), investment margins (through spreads or fees), net expense charges (expense charges assessed to the contract holder less expenses incurred to manage the business) and surrender fees drive life insurance profits. Mortality margins represent the difference between amounts charged to the customer to cover the mortality risk and the actual cost of reinsurance and death benefits paid. Mortality charges are either specifically deducted from the contract holder’s policy account value (i.e. cost of insurance assessments or “COI’s”) or are embedded in the premiums charged to the customer. In either case, these amounts are a function of the rates priced into the product and level of insurance in-force (less reserves previously set aside to fund benefits). Insurance in-force, in turn, is driven by sales, persistency, and mortality experience.  Similar to the annuity product classifications described above, life products can be classified as “fixed” or “variable” contracts. This classification describes whether we or the policy holders bear the investment risk of the assets supporting the policy. This also determines the manner in which we earn investment margin profits from these products, either as investment spreads for fixed products or as asset-based fees charged to variable products.  We offer four categories of life insurance products consisting of:  Interest-sensitive Life Insurance (primarily UL)  Interest-sensitive life insurance products provide life insurance with account (cash) values that earn rates of return based on company-declared interest rates. Contract holder account values are invested in our general account investment portfolio, so we bear the risk of investment performance. Some of our UL contracts include secondary guarantees, which are explained more fully later in the document.  In a UL contract, contract holders have flexibility in the timing and amount of premium payments and the amount of death benefit, provided there is sufficient account value to cover all policy charges for mortality and expenses for the coming period. Under certain contract holder options and market conditions, the death benefit amount may increase or decrease. Premiums received on a UL product, net of expense loads and charges, are added to the contract holder’s account value. The client has access to their account value (or a portion thereof) through contractual liquidity features such as loans, partial withdrawals, and full surrenders. Loans and withdrawals reduce the death benefit amount payable and are limited to certain contractual maximums (some of which are required under state law), and interest is charged on all loans. Our UL contracts assess surrender charges against the policies’ account values for full or partial face amount surrenders that occur during the contractual surrender charge period. Depending on the product selected, surrender charge periods can range from 0 to 20 years.  During 2007, we enhanced our fixed UL product offerings by introducing a fixed indexed universal life product. A fixed indexed UL product functions similarly to a traditional UL policy, with the added flexibility of allowing contract holders to have portions of their account value earn interest credits linked to the performance of the S&P 500 Index®. The indexed interest rate is guaranteed never to be less than 1%. Our fixed indexed UL policy provides contract holders a choice of a traditional fixed rate account and several different indexed accounts. A contract holder may elect to change allocations annually for amounts in the indexed accounts and quarterly for new premiums into the policy. Prior to each new allocation we have the opportunity to re-price the indexed components, subject to minimum guarantees.  We manage investment margins (i.e. the difference between the amount the portfolio earns compared to the amount that is credited to the customer) by seeking to maximize current yields, in line with asset/liability and risk management targets, while crediting a competitive rate to the customer. Crediting rates are typically subject to guaranteed minimums specified in the underlying life insurance contract. Interest-sensitive life account values (including MoneyGuard® and the fixed portion of VUL) were $23.2 billion, $21.9 billion and $11.8 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.    8    Table of Contents Linked-Benefit Life Products  Linked-benefit products combine universal life insurance with long-term care insurance through the use of riders. The first rider allows the contract holder to accelerate death benefits on a tax-free basis in the event of a qualified long-term care need. The second rider extends the long-term care insurance benefits for an additional period of time if the death benefit is fully depleted for the purposes of long-term care. If the long-term care benefits are never used, the policy provides a tax-free death benefit to the contract holder’s heirs. Linked-benefit products generate earnings through investment, mortality and morbidity margins. Our linked-benefit product is called MoneyGuard®.  VUL  VUL products are UL products that provide a return on account values linked to an underlying investment portfolio of sub-accounts offered through the product. The value of the contract holder’s account varies with the performance of the sub-accounts chosen by the contract holder. The underlying assets of the sub-accounts are managed within a special insurance series of mutual funds. Premiums, net of expense loads and charges for mortality and expenses, received on VUL products are invested according to the contract holder’s investment option selection. As the return on the investment portfolio increases or decreases, the account value of the variable universal life policy will increase or decrease. As with fixed UL products, contract holders have access, within contractual maximums, to account values through loans, withdrawals and surrenders. Surrender charges are assessed during the surrender charge period, ranging from 0 to 20 years depending on the product. The investment choices we offer in VUL products are the same, in most cases, as the investment choices offered in our individual variable annuity contracts.  In addition, VUL products offer a fixed account option that is managed by us. Investment risk is borne by the customer on all but the fixed account option. We charge fees for mortality costs and administrative expenses as well as asset-based investment management fees. VUL account values (excluding the fixed portion of VUL) were $5.0 billion, $4.6 billion and $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  As mentioned previously, we offer survivorship versions of our individual UL and VUL products. These products insure two lives with a single policy and pay death benefits upon the second death.  Sales results continue to be heavily influenced by the series of universal life products with secondary guarantees. A UL policy with a secondary guarantee can stay in force, even if the base policy account value is zero, as long as secondary guarantee requirements have been met. The secondary guarantee requirement is based on the evaluation of a reference value within the policy, calculated in a manner similar to the base policy account value, but using different assumptions as to expense charges, COI charges and credited interest. The assumptions for the secondary guarantee requirement are listed in the contract. As long as the contract holder funds the policy to a level that keeps this calculated reference value positive, the death benefit will be guaranteed. The reference value has no actual monetary value to the contract holder; it is only a calculated value used to determine whether or not the policy will lapse should the base policy account value be less than zero.  Unlike other guaranteed death benefit designs, our secondary guarantee benefits maintain the flexibility of a traditional UL policy, which allows a contract holder to take loans or withdrawals. Although loans and withdrawals are likely to shorten the time period of the guaranteed death benefit, the guarantee is not automatically or completely forfeited, as is sometimes the case with other death benefit guarantee designs. The length of the guarantee may be increased at any time through additional excess premium deposits. Secondary guarantee UL face amount in-force was $83.9 billion, $65.5 billion and $30.9 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For information on the reserving requirements for this business, see “Regulatory” below and “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition” in the MD&A.  During 2007, we expanded and enhanced our variable products by introducing a survivorship version of and enhancing our single life version of our secondary guarantee VUL products. These products combine the lapse protection elements of universal life with the upside potential of a traditional variable universal life product, giving clients the flexibility to choose the appropriate balance between protection and market risk that meets their individual needs. The combined single life and survivorship face amount in-force of these products was $4.0 billion, $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Term Life Insurance  Term life insurance provides a fixed death benefit for a scheduled period of time. It usually does not offer cash values. Scheduled policy premiums are required to be paid at least annually. Products offering a Return of Premium benefit payable at the end of a specified period are also available.    9    Table of Contents Distribution  The Life Insurance segment’s products are sold through LFD. LFD provides the Life Insurance segment with access to financial intermediaries in the following primary distribution channels – wire/regional firms, independent planner firms (including LFN), financial institutions and managing general agents/independent marketing organizations.  Competition  The life insurance industry is very competitive and consists of many companies with no one company dominating the market for all products. As of the end of 2006, the latest year for which data is available, there were 1,072 life insurance companies in the U.S., according to the American Council of Life Insurers.  The Life Insurance segment designs products specifically for the high-net-worth and affluent markets. In addition to the growth opportunity offered by its target market, our product breadth, design innovation, competitiveness, speed to market, customer service, underwriting and risk management and extensive distribution network all contribute to the strength of the Life Insurance segment. On average, the development of products takes approximately six months. The Life Insurance segment implemented several major product upgrades and/or new features, including important UL, VUL, linked-benefit and term product enhancements in 2007. With respect to customer service, management tracks the speed, accuracy and responsiveness of service to customers’ calls and transaction requests. Further, the Life Insurance segment tracks the turnaround time and quality for various client services such as processing of applications. Underwriting  In the context of life insurance, underwriting is the process of evaluating medical and non-medical information about an individual and determining the effect these factors statistically have on life expectancy or mortality. This process of evaluation is often referred to as risk classification. Of course, no one can accurately predict how long any individual will live, but certain risk factors can affect life expectancy and are evaluated during the underwriting process.  Claims Administration  Claims services are delivered to customers from the Greensboro, North Carolina and Concord, New Hampshire home offices. Claims examiners are assigned to each claim notification based on coverage amount, type of claim and the experience of the examiner. Claims meeting certain criteria are referred to senior claim examiners. A formal quality assurance program is carried out to ensure the consistency and effectiveness of claims examining activities. A network of in-house legal counsel, compliance officers, medical personnel and an anti-fraud investigative unit also support claim examiners. A special team of claims examiners, in conjunction with claims management, focus on more complex claims matters such as long-term care claims, claims incurred during the contestable period, beneficiary disputes, litigated claims and the few invalid claims that are encountered.  The Life Insurance segment maintains a centralized claim service center in order to minimize the volume of clerical and repetitive administrative demands on its claims examiners while providing convenient service to policy owners and beneficiaries.   EMPLOYER MARKETS  Overview  Lincoln Employer Markets offers and distributes a broad breadth of products focused on retirement income security through its Defined Contribution, Executive Benefits and Group Protection businesses. Lincoln Employer Markets was formed in 2006 to deliver retirement income security products and services that are focused on the needs of employers and their employees.  Although formed in 2006, Lincoln Employer Markets is well-established in the employer marketplace. As of December 31, 2007, Lincoln Employer Markets served approximately 60,000 plan sponsors and approximately 6 million plan participants.  The Employer Markets business provides its products through two key segments: Retirement Products and Group Protection. The Retirement Products segment includes two major lines of business:      •    The Defined Contribution business provides employer-sponsored fixed and variable annuities, mutual fund-based programs in the 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plan marketplaces through a wide range of intermediaries including advisors, consultants, brokers, banks, wirehouses, third-party administrators (“TPAs”) and individual planners.    10    Table of Contents   •    The Executive Benefits business offers corporate-owned universal and variable universal life insurance (“COLI”) and bank-owned universal and variable universal life insurance (“BOLI”) to small to mid-sized banks and mid to large-sized corporations, mostly through executive benefit brokers.  The Group Protection segment focuses on offering group term life, disability income and dental insurance primarily in the small to mid-sized employer marketplace for their eligible employees.   Employer Markets – Retirement Products  The Defined Contribution business is the largest business in this segment and focuses on 403(b) plans and 401(k) plans. Lincoln has a strong historical presence in the 403(b) space where assets account for about 61% of total assets under management in this segment as of December 31, 2007. The 401(k) business accounts for 51% of our new deposits as of December 31, 2007. The Retirement Products segment’s deposits (in millions) were as follows:                     For the Years Ended December 31,      2007   2006   2005   Variable portion of variable annuity   $ 2,355   $ 2,525   $ 2,254   Fixed portion of variable annuity     351     441     520                       Total variable annuity     2,706     2,966     2,774   Fixed annuity     754     506     563   Alliance Mutual Fund     2,090     1,113     1,066                       Total annuity and Alliance     5,550     4,585     4,403   COLI and BOLI     303     267     210                       Total deposits   $ 5,853   $ 4,852   $ 4,613                      Retirement Products – Defined Contribution  Products  Employer Markets currently offers four primary products to the employer-sponsored market: Lincoln American Legacy RetirementSM, LINCOLN DIRECTORSM, LINCOLN ALLIANCE® and Multi-Fund®. Lincoln American Legacy RetirementSM , LINCOLN DIRECTORSM and Multi-Fund® products are group variable annuities. LINCOLN ALLIANCE® is a mutual fund-based product. These products cover both the 403(b) and 401(k) marketplace. Both 403(b) and 401(k) plans are tax-deferred, defined contribution plans offered to employees of an entity to enable them to save for retirement. The 403(b) plans are available to employees of educational institutions and certain non-profit entities, while 401(k) plans are generally available to employees of for-profit entities. The investment options for our annuities encompass the spectrum of asset classes with varying levels of risk and include both equity and fixed income. As of December 31, 2007, healthcare clients accounted for 43% of account values for these products.  The Lincoln American Legacy RetirementSM variable annuity, launched in the third quarter of 2006, offers 51 investment options with 10 fund families, 20 of which are American Funds® options. This product is focused on the micro to small corporate 401(k) market. LALR account values were $49 million as of December 31, 2007.  LINCOLN DIRECTORSM is a defined contribution retirement plan solution available to businesses of all sizes, but focused on micro- to small-sized corporations, generally with five to 200 lives. Funded through a Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (“LNL”) group variable annuity contract, LINCOLN DIRECTORSM offers participants 60 investment options from 15 fund families. In New York, Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”) underwrites the annuity contracts, and these contracts offer 57 investment options from 16 fund families. LINCOLN DIRECTORSM has the option of being serviced through a third-party administrator or fully serviced by Lincoln. The Employer Markets Defined Contribution segment earns advisory fees, investment income, surrender charges and recordkeeping fees from this product. Account values for LINCOLN DIRECTORSM were $7.7 billion, $7.5 billion and $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Deposits for LINCOLN DIRECTORSM were $1.5 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  The LINCOLN ALLIANCE® program, with an open architecture platform, bundles our traditional fixed annuity products with the employer’s choice of retail mutual funds, along with recordkeeping and customized employee education components. We earn fees for the services we provide to mutual fund accounts and investment margins on fixed annuities of LINCOLN ALLIANCE® program accounts. The retail mutual funds associated with this program are not included in the separate accounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This program is customized for each employer. The target market is primarily education and     11    Table of Contents healthcare. LINCOLN ALLIANCE® program account values were $9.5 billion, $7.0 billion and $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Multi-Fund® Variable Annuity is a defined contribution retirement plan solution with full-bundled administrative services, experienced retirement consultants and high quality investment choices marketed to small- to mid-sized healthcare, education, governmental and not-for-profit plans. The product can be sold either to the employer through the Multi-Fund® Group Variable Annuity contract, or directly to the individual through the Multi-Fund® Select Variable Annuity contract. Funded through an LNL variable annuity contract, Multi-Fund® Variable Annuity offers participants 42 investment options from 9 fund families across a variety of asset classes. Included in the product offering is Lincoln Financial’s LIFESPAN® learning program, which provides participants with educational materials and one-on-one guidance for retirement planning assistance. We earn advisory fees, investment income, surrender charges and recordkeeping and administrative fees from this product. The Multi-Fund® Variable Annuity is currently not available in New York. Account values for the Multi-Fund®  Variable Annuity were $13.3 billion, $13.5 billion and $12.9 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Multi-Fund® program deposits represented 17%, 20% and 22% of the segment’s deposits in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Retirement Products - Executive Benefits  Products  Through the Executive Benefits business, we offer COLI and BOLI products. COLI and BOLI are typically purchased by corporations and banks on the lives of their employees, with the corporation or bank or a trust sponsored by the corporation or bank named as a beneficiary under the policy, for the purpose of funding various employee benefit plans, including non-qualified deferred compensation plans.  We offer a portfolio of both fixed UL and VUL COLI products sold primarily through specialty brokers. COLI and BOLI account values were $4.4 billion, $4.3 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  This segment also includes a closed-block of pension business in the form of group annuity and insured funding-type of contracts with assets under management of approximately $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2007. This block is currently in run-off.  Distribution  Defined Contribution has its own distribution force consisting of 80 internal and external wholesalers (including sales managers). The wholesalers distribute the Defined Contribution products through advisors, consultants, banks, wirehouses, TPAs and individual planners. Multi-Fund® is sold primarily through advisors to 403(b) plans in the healthcare and education markets. The LINCOLN ALLIANCE® program is sold primarily through consultants and advisors to 403(b) and 401(k) plans in the mid to large healthcare and corporate markets. Lincoln American Legacy RetirementSM and LINCOLN DIRECTORSM are sold primarily through banks, wirehouses, TPAs and individual planners to 401(k) plans in the micro to small corporate market. In October 2006, Employer Markets terminated its contract with the primary third-party wholesaler of the LINCOLN DIRECTORSM product. Although this termination did not have a material adverse effect on the Retirement Products segment’s results of operations, we have experienced a disruption in deposits and outflows of business as a result. However, we expect that in the long-term the benefits associated with our investment in a new wholesaling force will outweigh the consequences of terminating our third-party wholesaling relationship.  The distribution of Executive Benefit products are dominated by 15 intermediaries who specialize in the executive benefits market. We serve this group through a network of internal and external sales professionals.  Competition  The Retirement Products marketplace is very competitive and is comprised of many providers, with no one company dominating the market for all products. The Retirement Products area competes with numerous other financial services companies. The main factors upon which entities in this market compete are wholesaling, investment performance, cost, product features, speed to market, brand recognition, financial strength ratings, distribution channel access, crediting rates and client service.   Employer Markets – Group Protection  Overview  The Group Protection segment offers group non-medical insurance products, principally term life, disability and dental, to the employer marketplace through various forms of contributory and noncontributory plans. Most of the segment’s group contracts are sold to employers with fewer than 500 employees.    12    Table of Contents The Group Protection segment was added as a result of the merger with Jefferson-Pilot and was previously known as Benefit Partners. Accordingly, the insurance premium product line data (in millions) for this segment, provided in the following table, only include nine months during 2006:                  For the Years Ended December 31,      2007   2006   Life   $ 494   $ 334   Disability     601     407   Dental     136     95                 Total non-medical     1,231     836   Medical     149     113                 Total insurance premiums   $ 1,380   $ 949                Products  Group Life Insurance  We offer employer-sponsored group term life insurance products including basic, optional and voluntary term life insurance to employees and their dependents. Additional benefits may be provided in the event of a covered individual’s accidental death or dismemberment.  Group Disability Insurance  We offer short- and long-term employer-sponsored group disability insurance, which protects an employee against loss of wages due to illness or injury. Short-term disability generally provides benefits for up to 26 weeks following a short waiting period, ranging from one to 30 days. Long-term disability provides benefits following a longer waiting period, usually between 30 and 180 days and provides benefits for a longer period, at least two years and typically extending to normal (Social Security) retirement age.  Group Dental  We offer employer-sponsored group dental insurance, which covers a portion of the cost of eligible dental procedures for employees and their dependents. Products offered include indemnity coverage, which does not distinguish benefits based on a dental provider’s participation in a network arrangement, and a Preferred Provider Organization (“PPO”) product that does reflect the dental provider’s participation in the PPO network arrangement, including agreement with network fee schedules.  Distribution  The segment’s products are marketed primarily through a national distribution system of 27 regional group offices. These offices develop business through employee benefit brokers, third-party administrators and other employee benefit firms.  Competition  The Group Protection marketplace is very competitive. Principal competitive factors include particular product features, price, quality of customer service and claims management, technological capabilities, financial strength and claims-paying ratings. In the group insurance market, the Group Protection segment competes with a limited number of major companies and selected other companies that focus on these products.  Underwriting  The Group Protection segment’s underwriters evaluate the risk characteristics of each employee group. Generally, the relevant characteristics evaluated include employee census information (such as age, gender, income and occupation), employer industry classification, geographic location, benefit design elements and other factors. The segment employs detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks. The segment uses technology to efficiently review, price and issue smaller cases, utilizing its underwriting staff on larger, more complex cases. Individual underwriting techniques (including evaluation of individual medical history information) may be used on certain covered individuals selecting larger benefit amounts. For voluntary and other forms of employee paid coverages, minimum participation requirements are used to obtain a better spread of risk and minimize the risk of anti-selection.    13    Table of Contents Claims Administration  Claims for the Group Protection segment are managed by a staff of experienced claim specialists. Disability claims management is especially important to segment results, as results depend on both the incidence and the length of approved disability claims. The segment employs nurses and rehabilitation specialists to help evaluate medical conditions and develop return to work plans. Independent medical reviews are routinely performed by external medical professionals to further evaluate conditions as part of the claim management process.   INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT  Overview  The Investment Management segment, with principal operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, provides investment products and services to both individual and institutional investors through Delaware Management Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates, (“Delaware Investments”). Delaware Investments offers a broad line of mutual funds and other investment products to retail investors (including managed accounts).  Delaware Investments also offers investment advisory services and products to institutional clients, such as corporate and public retirement plans, endowments and foundations, nuclear decommissioning trusts, sub-advisory clients and Taft-Hartley plans, and includes mutual funds offered by non-Delaware Investments entities for which Delaware Investments acts as a sub-advisor. As of December 31, 2007, Delaware Investments served as investment advisor to approximately 200 institutional accounts, acted as investment manager and performed additional services for approximately 95 open-end funds and for 7 closed-end funds. The Investment Management segment also provides investment advisory services for our corporate and general insurance portfolios, including separate accounts and mutual funds, and acts as investment advisor to collateralized debt obligations.  Products  Investment Management products include U.S. and international equity and fixed-income retail mutual funds, institutional separate accounts, institutional mutual funds, managed accounts, as well as administration services for some of these products.  The Investment Management segment’s assets under management (including assets under administration) (in millions) were as follows:                     As of December 31,      2007   2006   2005   Retail – equity   $ 31,598   $ 31,705   $ 25,202   Retail – fixed     10,801     8,790     7,766                       Total retail     42,399     40,495     32,968                       Institutional – equity     21,732     21,957     18,755   Institutional – fixed (1)     11,526     21,105     13,079                       Total institutional     33,258     43,062     31,834                       Inter-segment assets     77,117     81,186     55,917                       Total assets under management   $ 152,774   $ 164,743   $ 120,719                       Total sub-advised assets, included above (2)   $ 20,789   $ 22,671   $ 20,503                           (1)  In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Investment Management segment sold a portion of our institutional fixed-income business to an unaffiliated investment management company.     (2)  Effective May 1, 2007, the investment advisory role for the Lincoln Variable Insurance Trust, a product within our Employer Markets business, transitioned from Investment Management to another internal advisor. In the role of investment advisor, Investment Management provided investment performance and compliance oversight on third-party investment managers in exchange for a fee. Investment Management will continue to manage certain of the assets as a sub-advisor. As a result of this change, the Investment Management assets under management decreased by $3.2 billion, with a corresponding reduction in investment advisory fees – inter-segment and associated expenses.    14    Table of Contents Retail Products and Services  The Investment Management segment offers various retail products including mutual funds to individual investors, as well as investment services to high net worth and small institutional investors through managed accounts. The retail assets under management were $42.4 billion, $40.5 billion and $33.0 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These assets include $16.2 billion, $18.0 billion and $15.4 billion of sub-advised assets as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We pay fees to the third party sub-advisors to manage the assets.  As of December 31, 2007, the Investment Management segment, through Delaware Investments, offered 42 open-end retail mutual funds to suit an array of investment needs. Delaware Investments’ mutual funds are grouped by asset class, with each investment management team focused on a specific investment discipline. This structure of distinct investment teams allows for a style-specific research effort tailored for each asset class. The mutual funds are owned by the shareholders of those funds and not by Delaware Investments. Delaware Investments manages the funds pursuant to an agreement with the separate funds boards. Accordingly, the mutual fund assets and liabilities, as well as related investment returns, are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Instead, Delaware Investments earns fees for providing the management and other services to the funds.  Delaware Investments manages both open-end and closed-end funds. An open-end mutual fund does not have a fixed number of shares and will normally offer as many shares as investors are willing to buy. Investors sell their shares by requesting the fund to redeem the shares. The open-end funds are available with various pricing structures, such as A-class with a front end sales charge, B-class and C-class with a contingent deferred sales charge as well as R-class and Institutional class, which are sold without a front end or contingent deferred sales charge and are designed for certain retirement plans and/or institutional investors. A-, B-, C- and R-classes are generally subject to Rule 12b-1 fees. A closed-end fund offers a fixed number of shares and is usually sold through a brokerage firm. After the initial offering, shares normally trade on a major stock exchange. During 2007, Investment Management closed three funds: the VIP Global Bond fund, which was liquidated in February 2007; the Tax Free Minnesota Insured fund, which merged into the Tax Free Minnesota fund in April 2007; and the Tax Free Florida Insured fund, which merged into the Tax Free USA fund in July 2007. In addition, Investment Management launched a new closed-end fund, the Delaware Enhanced Global Dividend and Income Fund, which combines domestic and international stocks, real estate investment trusts and debt securities for investors seeking diversification and high current income.  The Investment Management segment also provides investment advisory services to clients through separately managed accounts, commonly referred to as wrap accounts. These products are offered by a sponsor, typically a broker-dealer, to higher net worth individuals with a minimum investment of approximately $250,000. During 2006, the Investment Management segment closed the International American Depository Receipt (“ADR”) separately managed account product, which is sub-advised by Mondrian, and the Delaware Large Cap Growth Equity separately managed account to new investors. An ADR is a security that trades in the U.S. but represents a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation. ADRs are bought and sold on U.S. markets just like traditional stocks and are issued or sponsored in the U.S. by a bank or brokerage firm.  Institutional Products and Services  For institutional clients, the Investment Management segment offers Delaware Pooled Trust and institutional separate accounts and manages collaterized debt obligations (“CDOs”). Institutional assets under management were $33.3 billion, $43.1 billion and $31.8 billion as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Delaware Pooled Trust is a registered investment company which offers a series of mutual funds managed in styles that are similar to institutional separate account offerings and are best suited for smaller to medium-sized institutional investment mandates. Delaware Pooled Trusts’ minimum initial investment is typically $1 million. The funds included in Delaware Pooled Trust are offered without a sales charge directly through Delaware Investments’ institutional marketing and client services group.  The Investment Management segment provides investment advisory services through individually managed accounts to a broad range of institutional clients, such as corporate and public retirement plans, endowments and foundations, nuclear decommissioning trusts, sub-advisory clients and Taft-Hartley plans, among others. Included among sub-advisory clients are mutual funds and other commingled vehicles offered by institutional parties. Most clients utilize individually managed separate accounts, which means clients have the opportunity to customize the management of their portfolio by including or excluding certain types of securities, sectors or segments within a given asset class. Because of their individually managed nature, these separate accounts are best suited for larger investment mandates. Currently, the minimum account size is typically $25 million for U.S. investments.  The Investment Management segment also provides investment advisory services for CDOs. CDOs are pools of debt instruments that are securitized and sold to investors through a sponsor, typically an investment bank. The Investment Management segment does not invest in these securities but provides investment advisory services at a fee. As of December 31, 2007, the Investment Management segment provided advisory services for $6.1 billion of CDO’s.    15    Table of Contents As stated in “Acquisition and Dispositions” above, on October 31, 2007, we completed the sale with an unaffiliated investment management company involving certain members of our fixed income team and related institutional taxable fixed income business.  The Investment Management segment also provides investment management services for LNC’s general account assets for which it earns advisory revenue.  Distribution  The businesses in the Investment Management segment deliver their broad range of products through multiple distribution channels, enabling them to reach an expanding community of retail and institutional investors. Investment Management distributes retail mutual funds and managed accounts through intermediaries, including LFN, which are serviced by the LFD wholesaling distribution network. Delaware Distributors, L.P. is the principal underwriter for the Delaware Investments mutual funds and serves as a liaison between the funds and LFD.  Delaware Investments’ institutional marketing group, working closely with manager selection consultants, markets substantially all of the institutional products.  Competition  The Investment Management segment primarily competes with mutual fund complexes that are broker sold, and other asset managers offering managed accounts, institutional accounts and sub-advisory services. Competitive factors impacting the Investment Management segment include investment performance, breadth of investment styles offered, distribution capabilities and customer service.  Investment performance is a key driver of the Investment Management segment’s ability to attract new sales, retain existing assets and improve net flows.

Lincoln UK is primarily focused on protecting and enhancing the value of its existing customer base. The segment accepts new deposits on the existing block of business and markets a limited range of new products.  Beginning in 2006 and continuing into 2007, Lincoln UK began participating in our overall Retirement Income Security Venture initiative and we have now introduced retirement income product solutions into the U.K. marketplace. Lincoln UK’s product portfolio principally consists of unit-linked life and pension products, which are similar to U.S. produced variable life and annuity products, where the risk associated with the underlying investments is borne by the contract holders. These products have largely been issued to individuals, and benefits, premium levels and charges can often be varied within limits. Certain contract holders have chosen to contract out of the State Second Pension through a Lincoln personal pension arrangement. Lincoln UK receives rebate premiums from the government for those contract holders. These rebates are reported as deposits and as such only the fees earned by Lincoln UK are reported as revenue.  The Lincoln UK segment’s product revenues (in millions) were as follows:                     For the Years Ended December 31,      2007   2006   2005   Life products   $ 121   $ 95   $ 142   Pension products     160     131     88   Other products     8     11     10                       Total product revenues   $ 289   $ 237   $ 240                      Product revenues include premiums, fees and assessments for Lincoln UK’s products.  Our subsidiary in the U.K. has its balance sheets and income statements translated at the current spot exchange rate as of the year-end and average spot exchange rate for the year, respectively.  Lincoln UK has an evergreen agreement to outsource its customer service and policy administration functions to Capita Life & Pensions Services Limited, a subsidiary of Capita Group Plc (“Capita”). The purpose of the outsourcing is to reduce the operational risk and variability of future costs associated with administering the business by taking advantage of Capita’s proven expertise in providing outsourcing solutions to a variety of industries including insurance companies. To date, the relationship has provided the segment with results in line with expectations.   OTHER OPERATIONS  Overview  Other Operations includes the financial data for operations that are not directly related to the business segments, unallocated corporate items (such as investment income on investments related to the amount of statutory surplus in our insurance subsidiaries that is not allocated to our business units and other corporate investments, interest expense on short-term and long-term borrowings and certain expenses, including restructuring and merger-related expenses), along with the ongoing amortization of deferred gain on the indemnity reinsurance portion of the transaction with Swiss Re. Other Operations also includes the eliminations of intercompany transactions and the inter-segment elimination of the investment advisory fees for asset management services the Investment Management segment provides to Individual Markets and Employer Markets. In addition, as a result of our agreements dated as of November 12, 2007, we executed plans to divest our television broadcasting, sports programming and Charlotte radio stations, and accordingly, we have reported the results of these businesses as discontinued operations. Consequently, we no longer have the Lincoln Financial Media segment and now report our remaining media operations within Other Operations.    17    Table of Contents Revenues (in millions) from Other Operations were as follows:                        For the Years Ended December 31,        2007     2006     2005     Insurance premiums   $ 2     $ 5     $ 1     Net investment income     192       225       203     Amortization of deferred gain on indemnity reinsurance     74       75       76     Communications revenue (net)     107       85       —     Other revenues and fees     (7 )     (10 )     (6 )   Inter-segment elimination of investment advisory fees     (87 )     (97 )     (99 )                             Total operating revenues   $ 281     $ 283     $ 175                               REINSURANCE  We follow the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our life insurance and annuity risks with unaffiliated reinsurers. In a reinsurance transaction, a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium. We use reinsurance to protect our insurance subsidiaries against the severity of losses on individual claims and unusually serious occurrences in which a number of claims produce an aggregate extraordinary loss. We also use reinsurance to improve our results by leveraging favorable reinsurance pricing. Although reinsurance does not discharge the insurance subsidiaries from their primary liabilities to their contract holders for losses insured under the insurance policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk.  We reinsure approximately 45% to 50% of the mortality risk on newly issued non-term life insurance contracts and approximately 40% to 45% of total mortality risk including term insurance contracts. Our policy for this program is to retain no more than $10 million on a single insured life issued on fixed and variable universal life insurance contracts. Additionally, the retention per single insured life for term life insurance and for COLI is $2 million for each type of insurance.  On July 31, 2007, we entered into a reinsurance arrangement with Swiss Re covering Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage, our rider related to our Individual Market’s variable annuity products. This is the first time we have entered into a third-party reinsurance agreement related to our variable annuity business. Swiss Re is providing 50% quota share coinsurance of our lifetime guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, Lincoln SmartSecurity® Advantage, for business written in 2007 and 2008, up to a total of $3.8 billion in deposits. As of December 31, 2007, we had remaining capacity of $2.2 billion. We will retain 100% of the base variable annuity contracts. This reinsurance agreement strengthens and diversifies our enterprise risk management platform and expands our capacity with regard to retirement income security products.  Portions of our deferred annuity business have been reinsured on a modified coinsurance (“Modco”) basis with other companies to limit our exposure to interest rate risks. In a Modco program, the reinsurer shares proportionally in all financial terms of the reinsured policies (i.e. premiums, expenses, claims, etc.) based on their respective quota share of the risk.  In addition, we acquire other reinsurance to cover products other than as discussed above with retentions and limits that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances.  For more information regarding reinsurance, see “Reinsurance” in the MD&A and Note 8. For risks involving reinsurance, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”   RESERVES  The applicable insurance laws under which insurance companies operate require that they report, as liabilities, policy reserves to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. These reserves are the amounts that, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain specified mortality and morbidity tables, interest rates and methods of valuation.  The reserves reported in our financial statements contained herein are calculated based on GAAP and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states and carried in the statutory financial statements of the life insurance subsidiaries. These differences arise from the use of mortality and morbidity tables, interest, persistency and other assumptions which are believed to be more representative of the expected experience for these policies than those required for statutory accounting purposes and     18    Table of Contents  from differences in actuarial reserving methods. See “Regulatory” below for information on proposed regulations that may impact the amount of statutory reserves necessary to support our current insurance liabilities.  The assumptions on which reserves are based are intended to represent an estimation of experience for the period that policy benefits are payable. If actual experience is not less favorable than the reserve assumptions, then reserves should be adequate to provide for future benefits and expenses. If experience is less favorable than the reserve assumptions, additional reserves may be required. The key experience assumptions include mortality rates, policy persistency and interest rates. We periodically review our experience and update our policy reserves for new issues and reserve for all claims incurred as we believe appropriate.  For risks related to reserves, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”   INVESTMENTS  An important component of our financial results is the return on invested assets. Our investment strategy is to balance the need for current income with prudent risk management, with an emphasis on generating sufficient current income to meet our obligations. This approach requires the evaluation of risk and expected return of each asset class utilized, while still meeting our income objectives. This approach also permits us to be more effective in our asset-liability management, since decisions can be made based upon both the economic and current investment income considerations affecting assets and liabilities. Investments by our insurance subsidiaries must comply with the insurance laws and regulations of the states of domicile.  We do not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Derivatives are used for hedging purposes and income generation. Hedging strategies are employed for a number of reasons including, but not limited to, hedging certain portions of our exposure to changes in our GMDB, GMWB and GIB liabilities, interest rate fluctuations, the widening of bond yield spreads over comparable maturity U.S. Government obligations, and credit, foreign exchange and equity risks. Income generation strategies include credit default swaps through replication synthetic asset transactions. These derivatives synthetically create exposure in the general account to corporate debt, similar to investing in the credit markets. Our investment portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers. In addition, we do not have a significant concentration of investments in any single industry segment; no single segment comprised more than 10% of invested assets as of December 31, 2007.  For additional information on our investments, including carrying values by category, quality ratings and net investment income, see “Consolidated Investments” in the MD&A, as well as Notes 1 and 4.   RATINGS  The Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and the debt of LNC. Ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities.  Rating agencies rate insurance companies based on financial strength and the ability to pay claims, factors more relevant to contract holders than investors. We believe that the ratings assigned by nationally recognized, independent rating agencies are material to our operations. There may be other rating agencies that also rate our securities, which we do not disclose in our reports.  Insurer Financial Strength Ratings  The insurer financial strength rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) are characterized as follows:      •    A.M. Best – A++ to S      •    Fitch – AAA to D      •    Moody’s – Aaa to C      •    S&P – AAA to R    19    Table of Contents As of January 31, 2008, the financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our securities, or us, were as follows:                     A.M. Best    Fitch    Moody’s    S&P  LNL    A+ (2nd of 16)    AA (3rd of 24)    Aa3 (4th of 21)    AA (3rd of 21)  LLANY    A+ (2nd of 16)    AA (3rd of 24)    Aa3 (4th of 21)    AA (3rd of 21)  First Penn-Pacific Life Insurance Company (“FPP”)    A+ (2nd of 16)    AA (3rd of 24)    A1 (5th of 21)    AA- (4th of 21)  The A.M. Best, Fitch and Moody’s ratings above have a stable outlook. The S&P ratings have a positive outlook for LNL and LLANY.  A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings.  Debt Ratings  The long-term credit rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P are characterized as follows:      •    A.M. Best – aaa to d     •    Fitch – AAA to D     •    Moody’s – Aaa to C      •    S&P – AAA to D  As of January 31, 2008, our long-term credit ratings, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our long-term credit, were as follows:              A. M. Best   a   (6th of 22)     Fitch   A   (6th of 24)     Moody's   A3   (7th of 21)     S&P   A+   (5th of 22)     The short-term credit rating scales of A.M. Best, Fitch Ratings, Moody’s and S&P are characterized as follows:      •    A.M. Best – AMB-1+ to d      •    Fitch – F1 to D      •    Moody’s – P-1 to NP      •    S&P- A-1 to D  As of January 31, 2008, our short-term credit ratings, as published by the principal rating agencies that rate our short-term credit, were as follows:              A. M. Best   AMB-1   (2nd of 6)     Fitch   F1   (1st of 6)     Moody's   P-2   (2nd of 4)     S&P   A-1   (2nd of 6)     A downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital. In addition, a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above.  All of our ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies, and therefore, no assurance can be given that our principal insurance subsidiaries or that LNC can maintain these ratings. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.    20    Table of Contents  REGULATORY  General  Our insurance subsidiaries, like other insurance companies, are subject to regulation and supervision by the states, territories and countries in which they are licensed to do business. The extent of such regulation varies, but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to supervisory agencies. In the U.S., this power is vested in state insurance departments.  In supervising and regulating insurance companies, state insurance departments, charged primarily with protecting contract holders and the public rather than investors, enjoy broad authority and discretion in applying applicable insurance laws and regulation for that purpose. Our principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the following states:           Insurance Subsidiary    State of Domicile  LNL   Indiana  LLANY   New York  FPP   Indiana  During 2007, we merged our Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Company subsidiary, domiciled in North Carolina, and our Jefferson-Pilot Financial Insurance Company subsidiary, domiciled in Nebraska, with and into LNL. Also, in 2007, we redomiciled our Jefferson-Pilot LifeAmerica Insurance Company subsidiary from New Jersey to New York, and merged our New York domiciled company subsidiary, LLANY, with and into it. We renamed the merged entity LLANY. LLANY is a wholly owned subsidiary of LNL. Finally, as of October 1, 2007, LNL voluntarily withdrew as an accredited reinsurer from the state of New York.  The insurance departments of the domiciliary states exercise principal regulatory jurisdiction over our insurance subsidiaries. The extent of regulation by the states varies, but in general, most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing standards of solvency, adequacy of reserves, reinsurance, capital adequacy, licensing of companies and agents to transact business, prescribing and approving policy forms, regulating premium rates for some lines of business, prescribing the form and content of financial statements and reports, regulating the type and amount of investments permitted and standards of business conduct. Insurance company regulation is discussed further under “Insurance Holding Company Regulation” and “Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments.”  A new statutory reserving standard (commonly called “VACARVM”) is being developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) replacing current statutory reserve practices for variable annuities with guaranteed benefits, such as GMWBs. The timing for adoption of VACARVM is anticipated to occur sometime in 2008, with an effective date of December 31, 2008. Because the NAIC has not determined the final version of VACARVM, we cannot estimate the ultimate impact that VACARVM will have on our liquidity and capital resources. However, in its current draft form, VACARVM has the potential to require statutory reserves well in excess of current levels for certain variable annuity riders sold by us. We plan to utilize existing captive reinsurance structures, as well as pursue additional third-party reinsurance arrangements, to lessen any negative impact on statutory capital and dividend capacity in our life insurance subsidiaries. However, additional statutory reserves could lead to lower risk-based capital ratios and potentially reduce future dividend capacity from our insurance subsidiaries. For more information on VACARVM and our use of captive reinsurance structures, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the MD&A.  The U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry; however, federal initiatives from time to time can impact the insurance industry. In June 2001, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (“EGTRRA”) was enacted. EGTRRA contains provisions that have and will continue, near term, to significantly lower individual tax rates. These may have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the inside build-up of annuities and life insurance products. EGTRRA also includes provisions that will eliminate, over time, the estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes and partially eliminates the step-up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent’s estate. Some of these changes might hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance and annuity products. These provisions expire after 2010, unless extended.  In May 2003, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (“JGTRRA”) was enacted. Individual taxpayers are the principal beneficiaries of JGTRRA, which includes an acceleration of certain of the income tax rate reductions enacted originally under EGTRRA, as well as capital gains and dividend tax rate reductions. On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2006 (“TIPRA”) was signed into law. TIPRA extends the lower capital gains and dividends rates through the end of 2010. Although most of these rate reductions expire after 2010, these reductions have the effect of reducing the benefits of tax deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products. Like the EGTRRA changes, the JGTRRA changes may hinder our sales and result in increased surrender of insurance and annuity products.  On October 22, 2004, President Bush signed into law the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”), which includes provisions affecting non-qualified deferred compensation plans that may make such plans more complicated for employers     21    Table of Contents  depending on final tax rules and regulations. Because our COLI products are often used to support such deferred compensation liabilities, the AJCA may constrain sales of our COLI products.  In February 2007, bills were introduced in Congress to provide tax incentives designed to encourage individuals to invest their after-tax income in retirement vehicles, such as annuities, that provide guaranteed lifetime income. Under the proposal, individuals would not pay federal taxes on one-half of the income generated by annuities that make lifetime payments up to an annual limit of $20,000. If this bill is enacted into law, we believe that it would have a favorable impact on our annuity business.  In February 2008, the Bush Administration proposed that many of the temporary rate reductions from EGTRRA and the JGTRRA be made permanent. The Administration also continues to propose tax-favored savings initiatives that, if enacted by Congress, could also adversely affect the sale of our annuity, life and tax-qualified retirement products and increase the surrender of such products. However, we expect that the income for life guarantee provided within an annuity and features like our GMWB will continue to be viewed as significant benefits and may offset the adverse effect of these proposals.  On August 17, 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) was signed into law. PPA makes numerous changes to pension and other tax laws including: permanence for the EGTRRA enacted pension provisions including higher annual contribution limits for defined contribution plans and IRAs as well as catch-up contributions for persons over age 50; clarification of the safest available annuity standard for the selection of an annuity as a distribution option for defined contribution plans; expansion of investment advice options for defined contribution plan participants and IRA owners; more stringent funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans and clarification of the legal status of hybrid (cash balance) pension plans; and non-pension related tax changes such as the codification of COLI best practices bringing more certainty to this market segment; permanence for EGTRRA enacted tax benefits for section 529 college savings plans; and favorable tax treatment for long-term care insurance included as a rider to or on annuity products.  We expect many of these changes to have a beneficial effect upon various segments of our business lines.  Some of our separate accounts as well as mutual funds that we sponsor, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some or all states and the District of Columbia. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and are subject to federal and state regulation, including but not limited to the Financial Industry Regulation Authority’s (“FINRA”) net capital rules. In addition, we have several subsidiaries that are investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. LFN’s agents and our employees, insofar as they are involved in the sale or marketing of products that are securities, are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the FINRA and state securities commissioners. Regulation also extends to various LNC entities that employ or control those individuals. The SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of the regulated entity or its employees.  Federal and state regulators are devoting substantial attention to the mutual fund, indexed annuity and variable annuity businesses. As a result of publicity relating to widespread perceptions of industry abuses, there have been numerous regulatory reform initiatives addressing issues which include, but are not limited to, mutual fund governance and compliance practices, late trading, suitability of indexed and variable annuity products, directed brokerage and soft dollars, and new disclosure requirements concerning commission breakpoints, revenue sharing, shelf space, advisory fees, market timing, portfolio pricing, information about portfolio managers and other issues. While we have made certain changes to our businesses in response to new regulations, they have not had a significant impact on our businesses. However, it is difficult to predict whether additional changes resulting from new regulations will materially affect our businesses, and, if so, to what degree.  Insurance Holding Company Regulation  LNC and its primary insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation pursuant to the insurance holding company laws of the states of Indiana and New York. These insurance holding company laws generally require an insurance holding company and insurers that are members of such insurance holding company’s system to register with the insurance department authorities, to file with it certain reports disclosing information including their capital structure, ownership, management, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions, including material transfers of assets and intercompany business agreements, and to report material changes in that information. These laws also require that intercompany transactions be fair and reasonable and, under certain circumstances, prior approval of the insurance departments must be received before entering into an intercompany transaction. Further, these laws require that an insurer’s contract holders’ surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs.  In general, under state holding company regulations, no person may acquire, directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in our capital stock unless such person, corporation or other entity has obtained prior approval from the applicable insurance     22    Table of Contents  commissioner for such acquisition of control. Pursuant to such laws, in general, any person acquiring, controlling or holding the power to vote, directly or indirectly, ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurance company, is presumed to have “control” of such company. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact. The insurance commissioner, however, may find that “control” exists in circumstances in which a person owns or controls a smaller amount of voting securities. To obtain approval from the insurance commissioner of any acquisition of control of an insurance company, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an application containing information regarding: the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates; the nature, source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition; the financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates; any potential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer; the number and type of securities to be acquired; any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired; any agreements with broker-dealers; and other matters.  Other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed to transact business may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions. Additional requirements in those jurisdictions may include re-licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control. As further described below, laws that govern the holding company structure also govern payment of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries.  Restrictions on Subsidiaries’ Dividends and Other Payments  We are a holding company that transacts substantially all of our business directly and indirectly through subsidiaries. Our primary assets are the stock of our operating subsidiaries. Our ability to meet our obligations on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends and our general and administrative expenses depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us.  In addition, our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain insurance department regulatory restrictions as to the transfer of funds and payment of dividends to the holding company. Under Indiana laws and regulations, our Indiana insurance subsidiaries, including our primary insurance subsidiary, LNL, may pay dividends to LNC only from unassigned surplus, without prior approval of the Indiana Insurance Commissioner (the “Commissioner”), or must receive prior approval of the Commissioner to pay a dividend if such dividend, along with all other dividends paid within the preceding twelve consecutive months, would exceed the statutory limitation. The current statutory limitation is the greater of (i) 10% of the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus, as shown on its last annual statement on file with the Commissioner or (ii) the insurer’s statutory net gain from operations for the previous twelve months, but in no event to exceed statutory unassigned surplus. Indiana law gives the Commissioner broad discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits. New York, the state of domicile of our other major insurance subsidiary, LLANY, has similar restrictions, except that in New York it is the lesser of (i) 10% of surplus to contract holders as of the immediately preceding calendar year or (ii) net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including realized capital gains.  Indiana law also provides that following the payment of any dividend, the insurer’s contract holders’ surplus must be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs, and permits the Indiana Insurance Commissioner to bring an action to rescind a dividend which violates these standards. In the event that the Indiana Insurance Commissioner determines that the contract holders’ surplus of one subsidiary is inadequate, the Commissioner could use his or her broad discretionary authority to seek to require us to apply payments received from another subsidiary for the benefit of that insurance subsidiary. For information regarding dividends paid to us during 2007 from our insurance subsidiaries, see “Review of Consolidated Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources of Liquidity and Cash Flow” in the MD&A.  Lincoln UK’s insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the U.K. Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) and are subject to capital requirements as defined by the U.K. Capital Resources Requirement. Lincoln UK targets maintaining approximately 1.5 to 2.0 times the required capital as prescribed by the regulatory resource requirement. Effective January 1, 2005, all insurance companies operating in the U.K. also have to complete a risk-based capital (“RBC”) assessment to demonstrate to the FSA that they hold sufficient capital to cover their risks. RBC requirements in the U.K. are different than the NAIC requirements. In addition, the FSA imposes certain minimum capital requirements for the combined U.K. subsidiaries. As is the case with regulated insurance companies in the U.S., future changes to regulatory capital requirements could impact the dividend capacity of our U.K. insurance subsidiaries and cash flow to the holding company.  Risk-Based Capital  The NAIC has adopted risk-based capital requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks. The requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile. There are five major risks involved in determining the requirements.    23    Table of Contents          Category    Name    Description  Asset risk – affiliates   C-0   Risk of assets’ default for certain affiliated investments  Asset risk – other   C-1   Risk of assets’ default of principal and interest or fluctuation in fair value  Insurance risk   C-2   Risk of underestimating liabilities from business already written or inadequately pricing business to be written in the future   Interest rate risk, health credit risk and market risk   C-3   Risk of losses due to changes in interest rate levels, risk that health benefits prepaid to providers become the obligation of the health insurer once again and risk of loss due to changes in market levels associated with variable products with guarantees  Business risk   C-4   Risk of general business  A company’s risk-based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Regulators can then measure adequacy of a company’s statutory surplus by comparing it to the risk-based capital determined by the formula. Under RBC requirements, regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to its company action level of RBC (known as the RBC ratio), also as defined by the NAIC.  Four levels of regulatory attention may be triggered if the RBC ratio is insufficient:      •    “Company action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 75% and 100%, then the insurer must submit a plan to the regulator detailing corrective action it proposes to undertake.      •    “Regulatory action level” – If the RBC ratio is between 50% and 75%, then the insurer must submit a plan, but a regulator may also issue a corrective order requiring the insurer to comply within a specified period.      •    “Authorized control level” – If the RBC ratio is between 35% and 50%, then the regulatory response is the same as at the “Regulatory action level,” but in addition, the regulator may take action to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer.      •    “Mandatory control level” – If the RBC ratio is less than 35%, then the regulator must rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer.  As of December 31, 2007, the RBC ratios of LNL, LLANY and FPP reported to their respective states of domicile and the NAIC all exceeded the “Company action level.” We believe that we will be able to maintain the RBC ratios of our insurance subsidiaries in excess of “Company action level” through prudent underwriting, claims handling, investing and capital management. However, no assurances can be given that developments affecting the insurance subsidiaries, many of which could be outside of our control, including but not limited to changes in the regulatory environment, including changes to the manner in which the RBC ratio is calculated, economic conditions and competitive conditions in the jurisdictions in which we write business, will not cause the RBC ratios to fall below required levels resulting in a corresponding regulatory response.   EMPLOYEES  As of December 31, 2007, we had a total of 10,870 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.   AVAILABLE INFORMATION  We file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Also, the SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including LNC, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.  We also make available, free of charge, on or through our Internet website http://www.lfg.com, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.       Item 1A. Risk Factors  You should carefully consider the risks described below before investing in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected. In that case, the value of our securities could decline substantially.    24    Table of Contents Our reserves for future policy benefits and claims related to our current and future business as well as businesses we may acquire in the future may prove to be inadequate.  Our reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate. We establish and carry, as a liability, reserves based on estimates of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For our life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these reserves based on many assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums we will receive over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy, the lapse rate of the policies, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the assets we purchase with the premiums we receive. The assumptions and estimates we use in connection with establishing and carrying our reserves are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts that we will pay, or the timing of payment of, actual benefits and claims or whether the assets supporting the policy liabilities will grow to the level we assume prior to payment of benefits or claims. If our actual experience is different from our assumptions or estimates, our reserves may prove to be inadequate in relation to our estimated future benefits and claims. As a result, we would incur a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which we increase our reserves.  Because the equity markets and other factors impact the profitability and expected profitability of many of our products, changes in equity markets and other factors may significantly affect our business and profitability.  The fee revenue that we earn on equity-based variable annuities, unit-linked accounts, VUL insurance policies and investment advisory business is based upon account values. Because strong equity markets result in higher account values, strong equity markets positively affect our net income through increased fee revenue. Conversely, a weakening of the equity markets results in lower fee income and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources.  The increased fee revenue resulting from strong equity markets increases the expected gross profits (“EGPs”) from variable insurance products as do better than expected lapses, mortality rates and expenses. As a result, the higher EGPs may result in lower net amortized costs related to deferred acquisition costs (“DAC”), deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”), and deferred front-end sales loads (“DFEL”). However, a decrease in the equity markets as well as worse than expected increases in lapses, mortality rates and expenses depending upon their significance, may result in higher net amortized costs associated with DAC, DSI, VOBA and DFEL and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital resources. For more information on DAC, DSI, VOBA and DFEL amortization, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the MD&A.  Changes in the equity markets, interest rates and/or volatility affects the profitability of our products with guaranteed benefits; therefore, such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.  The amount of reserves related to GMDB for variable annuities is tied to the difference between the value of the underlying accounts and the guaranteed death benefit, calculated using a benefit ratio approach. The GMDB reserves take into account the present value of total expected GMDB payments and the present value of total expected assessments over the life of the contract and claims and assessments to date. The amount of reserves related to GMWB and GIB for variable annuities is based on the fair value of the underlying benefit. Both the level of expected GMDB payments and expected total assessments used in calculating the benefit ratio are affected by the equity markets. The liabilities related to GMWB and GIB benefits valued at fair value are impacted by changes in equity markets, interest rates and volatility. Accordingly, strong equity markets will decrease the amount of GMDB reserves that we must carry, and strong equity markets, increases in interest rates and decreases in volatility will generally decrease the fair value of the liabilities underlying the GMWB and GIB benefits.  Conversely, a decrease in the equity markets will increase the net amount at risk under the GMDB benefits we offer as part of our variable annuity products, which has the effect of increasing the amount of GMDB reserves that we must carry. Also, a decrease in the equity market along with a decrease in interest rates and an increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the fair value of the liabilities underlying GMWB and GIB benefits, which has the effect of increasing the amount of GMWB and GIB reserves that we must carry. Such an increase in reserves would result in a charge to our earnings in the quarter in which we increase our reserves. We maintain a customized dynamic hedge program that is designed to mitigate the risks associated with income volatility around the change in reserves on guaranteed benefits. However, the hedge positions may not be effective to exactly offset the changes in the carrying value of the guarantees due to, among other things, the time lag between changes in their values and corresponding changes in the hedge positions, high levels of volatility in the equity markets and derivatives markets, extreme swings in interest rates, contract holder behavior different than expected, and divergence between the performance of the underlying funds and hedging indices. For more information on our hedging program, see “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Future Contract Benefits and Other Contract Holder Funds” in the MD&A.    25    Table of Contents Changes in interest rates may cause interest rate spreads to decrease and may result in increased contract withdrawals.  Because the profitability of our fixed annuity and interest-sensitive whole life, UL and fixed portion of VUL insurance business depends in part on interest rate spreads, interest rate fluctuations could negatively affect our profitability. Changes in interest rates may reduce both our profitability from spread businesses and our return on invested capital. Some of our products, principally fixed annuities and interest-sensitive whole life, universal life and the fixed portion of variable universal life insurance, have interest rate guarantees that expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our “spread,” or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the amounts we are able to earn on our general account investments intended to support our obligations under the contracts. Declines in our spread or instances where the returns on our general account investments are not enough to support the interest rate guarantees on these products could have a material adverse effect on our businesses or results of operations.  In periods of increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the assets in our general account with higher yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep our interest sensitive products competitive. We therefore may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In periods of declining interest rates, we have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments then available. Moreover, borrowers may prepay fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities in our general account in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Because we are entitled to reset the interest rates on our fixed rate annuities only at limited, pre-established intervals, and since many of our contracts have guaranteed minimum interest or crediting rates, our spreads could decrease and potentially become negative.  Increases in interest rates may cause increased surrenders and withdrawals of insurance products. In periods of increasing interest rates, policy loans and surrenders and withdrawals of life insurance policies and annuity contracts may increase as contract holders seek to buy products with perceived higher returns. This process may lead to a flow of cash out of our businesses. These outflows may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. A sudden demand among consumers to change product types or withdraw funds could lead us to sell assets at a loss to meet the demand for funds.  A downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could limit our ability to market products, increase the number or value of policies being surrendered and/or hurt our relationships with creditors.  Nationally recognized rating agencies rate the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and rate our debt. Ratings are not recommendations to buy our securities. Each of the rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically, and our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. Please see “Item 1. Business – Ratings” for a complete description of our ratings.  Our financial strength ratings, which are intended to measure our ability to meet contract holder obligations, are an important factor affecting public confidence in most of our products and, as a result, our competitiveness. A downgrade of the financial strength rating of one of our principal insurance subsidiaries could affect our competitive position in the insurance industry and make it more difficult for us to market our products as potential customers may select companies with higher financial strength ratings. This could lead to a decrease in fees as outflows of assets increase, and therefore, result in lower fee income. Furthermore, sales of assets to meet customer withdrawal demands could also result in losses, depending on market conditions. The interest rates we pay on our borrowings are largely dependent on our credit ratings. A downgrade of our debt ratings could affect our ability to raise additional debt with terms and conditions similar to our current debt, and accordingly, likely increase our cost of capital. In addition, a downgrade of these ratings could make it more difficult to raise capital to refinance any maturing debt obligations, to support business growth at our insurance subsidiaries and to maintain or improve the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries described above.  A drop in the rankings of the mutual funds that we manage as well as a loss of key portfolio managers could result in lower advisory fees.   While mutual funds are not rated, per se, many industry periodicals and services, such as Lipper, provide rankings of mutual fund performance. These rankings often have an impact on the decisions of customers regarding which mutual funds to invest in. If the rankings of the mutual funds for which we provide advisory services decrease materially, the funds’ assets may decrease as customers leave for funds with higher performance rankings. Similarly, a loss of our key portfolio managers who manage mutual fund investments could result in poorer fund performance, as well as customers leaving these mutual funds for new mutual funds managed by the portfolio managers. Any loss of fund assets would decrease the advisory fees that we earn from such mutual funds, which are generally tied to the amount of fund assets and performance. This would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.    26    Table of Contents Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability.  Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation in the states in which we do business. The supervision and regulation relate to numerous aspects of our business and financial condition. The primary purpose of the supervision and regulation is the protection of our insurance contract holders, and not our investors. The extent of regulation varies, but generally is governed by state statutes. These statutes delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments. This system of supervision and regulation covers, among other things:      •    Standards of minimum capital requirements and solvency, including risk-based capital measurements;      •    Restrictions of certain transactions between our insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates;      •    Restrictions on the nature, quality and concentration of investments;      •    Restrictions on the types of terms and conditions that we can include in the insurance policies offered by our primary insurance operations;      •    Limitations on the amount of dividends that insurance subsidiaries can pay;      •    The existence and licensing status of the company under circumstances where it is not writing new or renewal business;      •    Certain required methods of accounting;      •    Reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes; and      •    Assignment of residual market business and potential assessments for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies provided by impaired, insolvent or failed insurance companies.  We may be unable to maintain all required licenses and approvals and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority’s interpretation of the laws and regulations, which may change from time to time. Also, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew or revoke licenses and approvals. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose substantial fines. Further, insurance regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to issue orders of supervision, which permit such authorities to supervise the business and operations of an insurance company. As of December 31, 2007, no state insurance regulatory authority had imposed on us any substantial fines or revoked or suspended any of our licenses to conduct insurance business in any state or issued an order of supervision with respect to our insurance subsidiaries, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  In addition, LFN and LFD, as well as our variable annuities and variable life insurance products, are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC and FINRA. Our Investment Management segment, like other investment management companies, is subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and jurisdictions of the states, territories and foreign countries in which they are licensed to do business. Lincoln UK is subject to regulation by the FSA in the U.K. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and self-regulatory organizations broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the subsidiaries from carrying on their businesses in the event that they fail to comply with such laws and regulations. Finally, our radio operations require a license, subject to periodic renewal, from the Federal Communications Commission to operate. While management considers the likelihood of a failure to renew remote, any station that fails to receive renewal would be forced to cease operations.  Many of the foregoing regulatory or governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our agents and employees. In recent years, there has been increased scrutiny of our businesses by these bodies, which has included more extensive examinations, regular “sweep” inquiries and more detailed review of disclosure documents. These regulatory or governmental bodies may bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if, in their view, our practices, or those of our agents or employees, are improper. These actions can result in substantial fines, penalties or prohibitions or restrictions on our business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  For further information on regulatory matters relating to us, see “Item 1. Business – Regulatory.”  Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.  Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, effective January 1, 2008, we adopted Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157 “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”) which resulted in an increase to our embedded derivative liability for variable annuity living benefits of $25 million – $75 million after     27    Table of Contents  DAC and after-tax, recorded through net income. For more information on SFAS 157 and other accounting pronouncements, see Note 2.  Legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses.  Federal and state regulators continue to focus on issues relating to variable insurance products, including suitability and replacements and sales to seniors. Like others in the industry, we have received inquiries including requests for information regarding sales to seniors from FINRA. We are in the process of responding to these inquiries. We continue to cooperate fully with such authority. In addition, we are, and in the future may be, subject to legal actions in the ordinary course of our insurance and investment management operations, both domestically and internationally. Pending legal actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the businesses in which we operate. Some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants. In certain of these matters, the plaintiffs are seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages. Substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation, which in turn could materially harm our business prospects. For more information on pending material legal proceedings, see “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”  Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could make some of our products less attractive to consumers and increase our tax costs.  EGTRRA and JGTRRA contain provisions that have and will (in the absence of any further legislation) continue, near term, to significantly lower individual tax rates. These may have the effect of reducing the benefits of deferral on the build-up of value of annuities and life insurance products. EGTRRA also includes provisions that will eliminate, over time, the estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes and partially eliminate the step-up in basis rule applicable to property held in a decedent’s estate. Many of these provisions expire in 2010, unless extended. The Bush Administration continues to propose that many of the foregoing rate reductions, as well as elimination of the estate tax, be made permanent, and continues to propose several tax-favored savings initiatives, that, if enacted by Congress, could also adversely affect the sale of our annuity, life and tax-qualified retirement products and increase the surrender of such products. Although we cannot predict the overall effect on the sales of our products of the tax law changes included in these Acts, some of these changes might hinder our sales and result in the increased surrender of insurance products.  In addition, changes to the Internal Revenue Code, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our effective tax rate. In this regard, on August 16, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a revenue ruling which purports, among other things, to modify the calculation of separate account deduction for dividends received by life insurance companies. Subsequently, the IRS issued another revenue ruling that suspended the August 16, 2007 ruling and announced a new regulation project on the issue. The current separate account deduction for dividends calculation lowered the effective tax rate by approximately 4% for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our businesses or result in losses.  We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective. Many of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models. As a result, these methods may not predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate, such as the risk of pandemics causing a large number of deaths. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.  Because we are a holding company with no direct operations, the inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations.  We are a holding company and we have no direct operations. Our principal asset is the capital stock of our insurance and investment management subsidiaries.  Our ability to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations and to pay dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses depends upon the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us. Payments of dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by the applicable laws of their respective jurisdictions, including laws establishing minimum     28    Table of Contents  solvency and liquidity thresholds. Changes in these laws can constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses.  We face a risk of non-collectibility of reinsurance, which could materially affect our results of operations.  We follow the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance subsidiaries (known as ceding). As of December 31, 2007, we have ceded approximately $351 billion of life insurance in-force to reinsurers for reinsurance protection. Although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay contract holders for losses insured under the policies we issue, reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk. As of December 31, 2007, we had $8.2 billion of reinsurance receivables from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses, for which they are obligated to reimburse us under our reinsurance contracts. Of this amount, $4.3 billion relates to the sale of our reinsurance business to Swiss Re in 2001 through an indemnity reinsurance agreement. Swiss Re has funded a trust to support this business. The balance in the trust changes as a result of ongoing reinsurance activity and was $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2007. In addition, should Swiss Re’s financial strength ratings drop below either S&P AA- or A.M. Best A or their NAIC risk based capital ratio fall below 250%, assets equal to the reserves supporting business reinsured must be placed into a trust according to pre-established asset quality guidelines. Furthermore, approximately $2.1 billion of the Swiss Re treaties are funds-withheld structures where we have a right of offset on assets backing the reinsurance receivables.  Included in the business sold to Swiss Re through indemnity reinsurance in 2001 was disability income business. Swiss Re is disputing its obligation to pay approximately $73 million of reinsurance recoverables on certain of this income disability business. We have agreed to arbitrate this dispute with Swiss Re. Although the outcome of the arbitration is uncertain, we currently believe that it is probable that we will ultimately collect the full amount of the reinsurance recoverable from Swiss Re and that Swiss Re will ultimately remain at risk on all of its obligations on the disability income business that it acquired from us in 2001.  During the third quarter of 2006, one of LNL’s reinsurers, Scottish Re Group Ltd (“Scottish Re”), received rating downgrades from various rating agencies. As of December 31, 2007, of the $800 million of fixed annuity business that LNL reinsures with Scottish Re, approximately 71% is reinsured through the use of Modco treaties, in which LNL possesses the investments that support the reserves ceded to Scottish Re. For its annuity business ceded on a coinsurance basis, Scottish Re had previously established an irrevocable investment trust for the benefit of LNL that supports the reserves. In addition to fixed annuities, LNL has approximately $108 million of policy liabilities on the life insurance business it reinsures with Scottish Re. Scottish Re continues to perform under its contractual responsibilities to LNL.  The balance of the reinsurance is due from a diverse group of reinsurers. The collectibility of reinsurance is largely a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers. We perform annual credit reviews on our reinsurers, focusing on, among other things, financial capacity, stability, trends and commitment to the reinsurance business. We also require assets in trust, letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions. Despite these measures, a reinsurer’s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract, especially Swiss Re, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Significant adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of, or higher prices for, reinsurance.  We reinsure a significant amount of the mortality risk on fully underwritten newly issued, individual life insurance contracts. We regularly review retention limits for continued appropriateness and they may be changed in the future. If we were to experience adverse mortality or morbidity experience, a significant portion of that would be reimbursed by our reinsurers. Prolonged or severe adverse mortality or morbidity experience could result in increased reinsurance costs, and ultimately, reinsurers not willing to offer coverage. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient, we would either have to be willing to accept an increase in our net exposures or revise our pricing to reflect higher reinsurance premiums. If this were to occur, we may be exposed to reduced profitability and cash flow strain or we may not be able to price new business at competitive rates.  Catastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for contract holder claims and the availability of reinsurance.  Our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic, an act of terrorism or other event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries. Significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century, but the likelihood, timing, or the severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted. In our group insurance operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.  The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes and man-made catastrophes, including terrorism, may produce     29    Table of Contents  significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. Also, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Accordingly, our ability to write new business could also be affected.  Consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities, and a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We may be unable to attract and retain sales representatives and other employees, particularly financial advisors.  We compete to attract and retain financial advisors, wholesalers, portfolio managers and other employees, as well as independent distributors of our products. Intense competition exists for persons and independent distributors with demonstrated ability. We compete with other financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products, compensation, support services and financial position. Sales in our businesses and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining financial advisors, wholesalers, portfolio managers and other employees, as well as independent distributors of our products.  Our sales representatives are not captive and may sell products of our competitors.  We sell our annuity and life insurance products through independent sales representatives. These representatives are not captive, which means they may also sell our competitors’ products. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours, or pay higher commission rates to the sales representatives than we do, these representatives may concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors’ products instead of ours.  Intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.   Our businesses are intensely competitive. We compete based on a number of factors including name recognition, service, the quality of investment advice, investment performance, product features, price, perceived financial strength, claims-paying and credit ratings. Our competitors include insurers, broker-dealers, financial advisors, asset managers and other financial institutions. A number of our business units face competitors that have greater market share, offer a broader range of products or have higher financial strength or credit ratings than we do.  In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry resulting in increased competition from large, well-capitalized financial services firms. Many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements. Furthermore, larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings, thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively. We expect consolidation to continue and perhaps accelerate in the future, thereby increasing competitive pressure on us.  Losses due to defaults by others could reduce our profitability or negatively affect the value of our investments.  Third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets may not pay or perform their obligations. These parties include the issuers whose securities we hold, borrowers under the mortgage loans we make, customers, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, reinsurers and other financial intermediaries. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy or real estate values, operational failure, corporate governance issues or other reasons. A downturn in the U.S. and other economies could result in increased impairments.  Anti-takeover provisions could delay, deter or prevent our change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to LNC shareholders.  We are an Indiana corporation subject to Indiana state law. Certain provisions of Indiana law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us. Also, provisions in our articles of incorporation, bylaws and other agreements to which we are a party could delay, deter or prevent our change in control, even if a change in control would be beneficial to shareholders. In addition, under Indiana law, directors may, in considering the best interests of a corporation, consider the effects of any action on stockholders, employees, suppliers and customers of the corporation and the communities in which offices and other facilities are located, and other factors the directors consider pertinent. One statutory provision prohibits, except under specified circumstances, LNC from engaging in any business combination with any shareholder who owns 10% or more of our common stock (which shareholder, under the statute, would be considered an “interested shareholder”) for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless such business combination is     30    Table of Contents  approved by the board of directors prior to such person becoming an interested shareholder. In addition, our articles of incorporation contain a provision requiring holders of at least three-fourths of our voting shares then outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors, voting together, to approve a transaction with an interested shareholder rather than the simple majority required under Indiana law.  In addition to the anti-takeover provisions of Indiana law, there are other factors that may delay, deter or prevent our change in control. As an insurance holding company, we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled. The insurance holding company acts and regulations restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes and regulations, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company, or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would “control” the insurance holding company or insurance company. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person.  Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by general domestic economic and business conditions that are less favorable than anticipated.  Recent events, including fallout from problems in the U.S. credit markets, indicate a potential near-term recession in the U.S. economy. A steady economy is important as it provides for continuing demand for our insurance and investment-type products. Insurance premium growth, with respect to life and disability products, for example, is closely tied to employers’ total payroll growth. A recession resulting in higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, could cause the demand for our financial and insurance products to be adversely affected, and therefore, have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, continued problems in the U.S. capital markets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.       Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
