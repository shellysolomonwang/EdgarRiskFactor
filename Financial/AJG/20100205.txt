Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine Gallagher’s profitability.  Gallagher derives much of its revenue from commissions and fees for its brokerage services. Gallagher does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. For example, for several years through late 2000, heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations, resulted in flat or reduced premium rates (a “soft” market), which in turn put downward pressure on Gallagher’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas. Beginning in late 2000, the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market, in which premium rates were stable or increasing. Because of the events of September 11th, many insurance lines became less available and premium rates increased, in some cases dramatically. Beginning in late 2003, the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas. While the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certain coastal areas, the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to again become rate/price sensitive and the industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines. The higher level of hurricane activity in 2008 generally did not cause the carriers to deviate from the trends noted in 2006 and 2007. Because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing, which Gallagher cannot predict or control, its brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as Gallagher, those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect Gallagher’s profitability. Because Gallagher does not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, Gallagher cannot accurately forecast its commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, Gallagher’s budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of its operations.  In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While Gallagher historically has been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of its customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that Gallagher will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from its traditional brokerage activities.  Gallagher faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses.  The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with Gallagher in one or more areas of its business. Gallagher competes with four firms that are as large as or significantly larger than Gallagher, in terms of revenues, in the global risk management and brokerage markets. In addition, there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have, in that region or locality, an office that is as large as or larger than, in terms of revenues, the particular local office of Gallagher. Gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect Gallagher’s business.  In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect Gallagher. These developments include:        •    An increase in capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions;        •    The selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;        •    Changes in Gallagher’s business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments;        •    The establishment of programs by Federal and state governments to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, which compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers;    9    Table of Contents     •    An increase in competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms and consulting firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services; and        •    The creation of in-house servicing capabilities by insurance companies or by certain insurance consumers which compete with the third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products offered by Gallagher’s Risk Management Segment.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for Gallagher’s products and services to change, which could in turn adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition.  The current disruption in the global credit markets and instability of financial systems, and a continuation or worsening of the current economic recession, may adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition.  The current disruption in the global credit markets, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies. These conditions include significant losses, greater volatility, significantly less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets. These conditions have resulted in the failure of a number of financial institutions and unprecedented action by governmental authorities and central banks around the world, including investing in or lending money to financial institutions and insurance companies that are perceived to need additional capital. It is difficult to predict how long these conditions will persist and the extent to which Gallagher’s markets, products and business will be adversely affected.  These unprecedented disruptions in the credit and financial markets and the resulting impact on a number of financial institutions have limited access to capital and credit for many companies. Although Gallagher is not currently experiencing any limitation of access to its revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2010, and is not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of its lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend Gallagher credit, the failure of a lender could adversely affect its ability to borrow on that facility, which over time could negatively impact Gallagher’s ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures. Continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings.  The disruptions in the credit and financial markets also led to a general deterioration in the economy in fourth quarter 2008 and throughout 2009, which could adversely impact Gallagher in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that its clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. Such reductions could also adversely impact Gallagher’s 2010 and 2011 commission revenues when exposure audits by the carriers are performed and if subsequent downward premium adjustments are determined. The income effects of subsequent premium adjustments are recorded when the adjustments become known, and, as a result, any improvement in Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. In addition, some of Gallagher’s clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which would have an adverse effect on Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition. Gallagher also has a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which it places insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, Gallagher could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to Gallagher, which could have a significant adverse impact on Gallagher’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that Gallagher offers its clients, overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could reduce Gallagher’s placement of certain lines and types of insurance and, as a result, reduce its revenues and profitability. The failure of an insurer with whom Gallagher places business could also result in errors and omissions claims by Gallagher’s clients, which could adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition.  Gallagher has historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies. Gallagher may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions.  In the past several years, Gallagher has completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth and Gallagher believes that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in Gallagher achieving slower growth. Moreover, even if Gallagher is able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, it may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows Gallagher to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Additionally, Gallagher may incur or assume unanticipated liabilities or contingencies in connection with its acquisitions. If any of these developments occur, Gallagher’s results of operations could be adversely affected.    10    Table of Contents The agreements and instruments governing Gallagher’s debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact Gallagher’s ability to operate its business.  The agreements governing Gallagher’s debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict Gallagher’s ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change Gallagher’s business or make investments.  The restrictions in the agreements governing Gallagher’s debt may prevent it from taking actions that it believes would be in the best interest of Gallagher’s business and its stockholders and may make it difficult for Gallagher to execute its business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Gallagher may also incur future debt obligations that might subject it to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect Gallagher’s financial and operational flexibility. Gallagher cannot make any assurances that it will be able to refinance its debt on terms acceptable to Gallagher, or at all.  Gallagher’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing Gallagher’s debt may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond Gallagher’s control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which could have a material adverse effect on Gallagher’s financial condition and results of operations.  Gallagher could incur substantial losses if one of the commercial banks and financial institutions Gallagher uses in its operations should happen to fail.  Gallagher maintains cash balances, including restricted cash held in premium trust and claim accounts, at various depository institutions. Although Gallagher has moved a substantial portion of its U.S. funds into accounts or funds insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government, there are client claim funds, which Gallagher administers that are in individual accounts with balances well in excess of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Gallagher also maintains cash balances in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs. If one or more of the depository institutions in which Gallagher maintains significant cash balances were to fail, Gallagher’s ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and Gallagher could face a significant liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses.  Gallagher has non-U.S. operations which expose it to certain additional risks, including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk.  Gallagher has operations that conduct business outside the U.S. Accordingly, Gallagher is subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries. Operating in these countries may present risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks to Gallagher of doing comparable business in the U.S. These include, among others, risk relating to:        •    Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;        •    Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit Gallagher’s ability to prohibit employees from competing with Gallagher after their employment, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;        •    Political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);        •    Coordinating Gallagher’s communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones;        •    The requirement of complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad, including rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Union and the United Nations, and the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which Gallagher operates, as well as unexpected changes in such regulatory requirements and laws;        •    Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which Gallagher operates;        •    Adverse changes in tax rates;        •    Legal or political constraints on Gallagher’s ability to maintain or increase prices; and        •    Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to Gallagher from its operations outside the U.S.    11    Table of Contents Some of Gallagher’s foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Gallagher must also translate the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although Gallagher has used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations.  Gallagher also operates in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the U.S. and more stable countries. Gallagher’s operations in these countries may be temporarily or permanently disrupted by adverse geopolitical or economic conditions in these locations. For example, Gallagher uses third-party service providers located in India for certain back-office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected Gallagher’s operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect Gallagher’s operations or ability to utilize third-party providers in the future. Should Gallagher’s access to these services be disrupted, Gallagher’s business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Gallagher faces a variety of risks in its Risk Management operations that are distinct from those it faces in its Brokerage operations.  Gallagher’s Risk Management business faces a variety of risks distinct from those faced by its Brokerage business, including:        •    The risk that the favorable trend among insureds toward outsourcing of various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing Gallagher to experience reduced revenues or a reduced rate of revenue growth;        •    The risk that contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on its services will be decreased due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments;        •    The risk that Gallagher will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make its business less attractive;        •    The risk that the recession and corresponding slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims processed by Gallagher; and        •    The risk that Gallagher will not be able to control its labor and technology costs in such a manner as to remain competitive in the marketplace for claims administration and risk management services and fulfill its existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection) in a cost-efficient and profitable manner.  If any of these developments occur, Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Gallagher is subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide. If Gallagher fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects Gallagher’s operations, Gallagher may not be able to conduct its business or may be less profitable.  Many of Gallagher’s activities are subject to regulatory supervision. Failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary actions that may include requiring clients to be compensated for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of Gallagher’s authorization to operate. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time-to-time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder Gallagher’s ability to operate its business. For example, although Gallagher’s inability to accept contingent commissions under an agreement with the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and the Director of Insurance of the State of Illinois ended on October 1, 2009, compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny of the public, State Attorneys General, and state insurance departments, which could lead to regulations prohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice. If this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur, Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Changes in Gallagher’s accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect its financial position and operating results.  Gallagher prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These accounting principles require Gallagher to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Gallagher is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. Gallagher periodically evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of intangible assets,    12    Table of Contents  investments, income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. Gallagher bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that Gallagher believes to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on Gallagher’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Gallagher is subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to Gallagher, would adversely affect its financial results.  Gallagher is subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that its employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that Gallagher holds for its clients on a fiduciary basis. Gallagher has established provisions against these potential matters which it believes to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and Gallagher adjusts such provisions from time-to-time based on current material developments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to Gallagher, it could materially adversely affect its future financial results. In addition, Gallagher’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future, Gallagher’s insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which it self-insures. Gallagher has purchased errors and omissions (E&O) insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time-to-time as current developments warrant.  As more fully described in Note 17 to Gallagher’s 2009 Consolidated Financial Statements, Gallagher is subject to a number of legal proceedings, regulatory actions and other contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on Gallagher’s business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on Gallagher by exposing it to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to Gallagher’s client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources.  Contingent commissions paid by insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions, and any decrease in the amount of contingent commissions received by Gallagher could adversely affect its results of operations.  Gallagher derives a portion of its revenues from contingent commissions paid by insurance companies. Contingent commissions are special revenue-sharing commissions paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, Gallagher is unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves, over which Gallagher has no control, actual contingent commissions received by Gallagher could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations. Additionally, because of these uncertainties, it is difficult for Gallagher to make profit-sharing calculations and accurately estimate the amount of contingent commissions it will receive during a given year.  Gallagher’s future success depends, in part, on its ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.  Gallagher believes that its future success depends, in part, on its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including its senior management, brokers and other key personnel. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers, and Gallagher has lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of any of its senior managers, brokers or other key personnel, or its inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect Gallagher’s business, operating results and financial condition.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce Gallagher’s profitability.  Gallagher’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under its legacy defined benefit plans. In recent years, Gallagher has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond Gallagher’s control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate    13    Table of Contents  pension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of Gallagher’s defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years. Although Gallagher has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance Gallagher will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce Gallagher’s profitability.  Gallagher has historically benefited from Section 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting Gallagher to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits related to Gallagher’s synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, Gallagher’s annual effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was 36.9%, 31.9% and 22.7%, respectively. Gallagher’s overall effective income tax rate for 2007 reflects the tax credits generated by investments in limited partnerships that operated alternative energy projects under IRC Section 29. The rates for 2009, 2008 and 2007 reflect the impact of the resolution of a number of income tax matters related to prior years and revisions to estimates of uncertain tax positions, which resulted in a net decrease in Gallagher’s tax provision of $3.6 million, $14.9 million and $5.9 million, respectively.  Gallagher believes its claim for IRC Section 29-related related tax credits is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings (PLRs) previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related partnerships in which it had an interest. Gallagher understands these PLRs are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and has received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them.  While Gallagher’s synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause Gallagher to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29-related tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Gallagher has developed production facilities with the ability to produce refined coal that it believes qualifies for tax credits under IRC Section 45. However, there are significant uncertainties surrounding Gallagher’s investment in these facilities, and if Gallagher is not successful in claiming IRC Section 45 tax credits, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.  IRC Section 45 provides a tax credit for the production and sale of refined coal from production facilities that were placed into service on or before December 31, 2009. Gallagher owns 42% of Chem-Mod, LLC, which has developed technologies (The Chem-Mod™ Solution) that reduce harmful emissions from coal-fired power plants. Gallagher intends to use The Chem-Mod™ Solution to produce refined coal at eight production facilities placed into service prior to December 31, 2009. Gallagher believes that the production and sale of this refined coal qualifies for IRC Section 45 tax credits. Gallagher has funded $29.7 million of capital expenditures to date, and has committed to make additional capital expenditures of $1.7 million in 2010 to complete the construction contract obligations of these facilities. Once Gallagher has finalized arrangements with various partners expected to purchase equity stakes in one or more of the facilities, Gallagher’s net investment in the facilities is expected to be approximately $16.0 million.  There are significant uncertainties related to Gallagher’s IRC Section 45 investments that must be favorably resolved in order for Gallagher to recoup its investment and generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities. These include, but are not limited to:        •    Long-term permits must still be obtained. The eight facilities are currently operating under temporary permits obtained by the utilities upon whose properties the refined coal production facilities are located. In order to obtain long-term permits, the utilities need to show not only reductions in nitrogen oxides and mercury emissions, as required by IRC Section 45, but also reductions in sulfur, carbon monoxide and particulate emissions while at the same time maintaining all other emissions limits and performance standards required under their air permits. If for any reason the facilities are unable to satisfy the regulatory permitting requirements and the utilities are unable to timely obtain long-term permits, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.        •    All conditions under IRC Section 45 must be satisfied. Gallagher’s ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions specified in IRC Section 45. Gallagher may be determined not to have satisfied such conditions if, among other things, Gallagher’s conclusions with respect to one or more of the following are incorrect: the accuracy of the emissions reduction analyses upon which Gallagher has relied and continues to rely, that The Chem-Mod™ Solution represents qualifying technologies under the rules, that the technologies were applied correctly    14    Table of Contents       by the facilities such that at least one of the facilities’ owners (Gallagher or one of its partners) can be treated as a “producer” of refined coal, or that the facilities were placed into service by December 31, 2009. Additionally, IRC Section 45 contains phase-out provisions based upon the market price of coal. As a result, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, Gallagher could lose some or all of the future tax credits it expects to receive from these investments.        •    Additional regulatory uncertainties. In the future, utilities may become subject to other regulations that render The Chem-Mod™ Solution obsolete or unusable. Congress may modify or repeal IRC Section 45 so that these tax credits may no longer be available or the law may be interpreted to exclude The Chem-Mod™ Solution. In addition, current environmental laws and regulations limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants could be significantly weakened, reducing demand for technologies like The Chem-Mod™ Solution, or could be strengthened beyond the capabilities of The Chem-Mod™ Solution to comply. If any of these regulatory developments occur, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.        •    Utilities’ use of coal may decline. Increasing concerns about greenhouse gases and other air emissions, toxic materials in wastewater discharges and the potential hazardous nature of coal combustion waste, could lead to Federal or state regulations that encourage or require utilities to burn less coal, or eliminate its use entirely, in the production of electricity. In addition, while the utilities at which the facilities are located have traditionally burned coal to generate electricity, some are also engineered to burn other fuels such as natural gas and oil. Thus, if the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to the price of coal, utilities may choose to burn natural gas or oil instead of coal to produce electricity. Demand for coal, generally, may also decline as a result of a slowing economy and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. If, for any reason, utilities burn less or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.        •    Operational risks. The facilities’ ability to produce refined coal meeting the requirements of IRC Section 45 may be affected by operational issues. Chem-Mod’s coal-cleaning technologies require proprietary chemical inputs that may not be readily available in the marketplace or available only at prohibitively high costs. The power plants at which the facilities are located could be idled for reasons outside Gallagher’s control, including, among other things, operational or environmental problems at the plants, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operation of the facilities. Other operational risks include the availability and cost of coal (including freight cost), the possibility that the refined coal produced by the facilities may cause operational problems in the utilities’ boilers, the risk that equipment may not be properly maintained, the risk that the facilities might be unable to operate at their rated capacity, and the possibility that the facilities could be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key personnel needed for efficiently operating the facilities. If the facilities encounter any operational problems, including the types described above, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.        •    Business risks. Gallagher has finalized arrangements with one co-investor, and is working to finalize arrangements with other potential co-investors, for the purchase of equity stakes in one or more of the facilities. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of Gallagher’s co-investors leave a project, Gallagher could have difficulty finding replacements in a timely manner. Gallagher is exposed to credit risk with its co-investors and operational partners, any of which could encounter economic difficulties and become unable to fulfill payment obligations. Gallagher could also be exposed to risk due to its lack of control over the facilities if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, caused the interests of Gallagher and its co-investors to diverge. Finally, Gallagher’s partners involved in the operation and management of the facilities could fail to operate the facilities in a manner that complies with the requirements of IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, Gallagher may not be able to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.        •    Intellectual property risks. Other companies with technologies similar to The Chem-Mod™ Solution may make claims of intellectual property infringement against Chem-Mod or Gallagher and its partners. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod or Gallagher and its partners obtain a license to use the intellectual property. Chem-Mod or Gallagher and its partners may be unable to obtain licenses from these third parties on favorable terms, if at all. If Chem-Mod or Gallagher and its partners cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, Gallagher may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod™ Solution and may be unable to recoup its investment or generate additional earnings from the operation of these facilities.  Operations at the IRC Section 45 production facilities and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs.  The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 production facilities are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the facilities and/or the utilities at which the facilities are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and    15    Table of Contents  regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using The Chem-Mod™ Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem Mod™ Solution at facilities owned and operated by others, Gallagher and its partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage they may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after operations cease at a facility to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod™ Solution. For example, Gallagher and its partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod™ Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Gallagher’s insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
