Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine Gallagher’s profitability.  Gallagher derives much of its revenue from commissions and fees for its brokerage services. Gallagher does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. For example, for several years through late 2000, heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates (a “soft” market), which in turn put downward pressure on Gallagher’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas.    9    Table of Contents Beginning in late 2000, the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market, in which premium rates were stable or increasing. Because of the events of September 11th, many insurance lines became less available and premium rates increased, in some cases dramatically. Beginning in late 2003, the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas. While the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certain coastal areas, the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to again become rate/price sensitive and the industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines. The higher level of hurricane activity in 2008 generally did not cause the carriers to deviate from the trends noted in 2006 and 2007. Because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing, which Gallagher cannot predict or control, its brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as Gallagher, those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect Gallagher’s profitability. Because Gallagher does not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, Gallagher cannot accurately forecast its commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, Gallagher’s budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of its operations.  In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While Gallagher historically has been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of its customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that Gallagher will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from its traditional brokerage activities.  Gallagher faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses.  The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with Gallagher in one or more areas of its business. Gallagher competes with three firms that are as large as or significantly larger than Gallagher, in terms of revenues, in the global risk management and brokerage markets. In addition, there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have, in that region or locality, an office that is as large as or larger than, in terms of revenues, the particular local office of Gallagher. Gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect Gallagher’s business.  In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect Gallagher. These developments include:        •    An increase in capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry which in turn may lead to a soft market and lower insurance premiums and commissions;        •    The selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;        •    Changes in Gallagher’s business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments;        •    The establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative markets types of coverage;        •    An increase in competition from newly-formed or existing insurance brokers who have not agreed to limit their use of contingent commission arrangements, thereby giving them a competitive advantage over those brokers, such as Gallagher, who have agreed to limit the use of such arrangements;        •    An increase in competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms and consulting firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services; and        •    The creation of in-house servicing capabilities by insurance companies or by certain insurance consumers which compete with the third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products offered by Gallagher’s Risk Management Segment.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for Gallagher’s products and services to change, which could in turn adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition.    10    Table of Contents Gallagher’s businesses, and therefore its results of operations and financial condition, may be adversely affected by the current disruption in the global credit markets and instability of financial systems.  Gallagher’s business, and therefore its results of operation and financial condition, may be adversely affected by the current disruption in the U.S. based credit markets and instability of financial systems.  The current disruption in the U.S. based credit markets, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial and real estate markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions and certain insurance companies. These conditions include significant losses, greater volatility, significantly less liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in certain markets. In recent months, such volatility has reached unprecedented levels and credit markets have been illiquid. These conditions have resulted in the failure of a number of financial institutions and unprecedented action by governmental authorities and central banks around the world, including investing in or lending money to financial institutions and insurance companies that are perceived to need additional capital. It is difficult to predict how long these conditions will persist and the extent to which Gallagher’s markets, products and business will be adversely affected.  These unprecedented disruptions in the current credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies. Although Gallagher is not currently experiencing any limitation of access to its revolving credit facility (which expires in 2010) and is not aware of any issues impacting the ability or willingness of its lenders under such facility to honor their commitments to extend Gallagher credit, the failure of a lender could adversely affect its ability to borrow on that facility, which over time could negatively impact Gallagher’s ability to consummate significant acquisitions or make other significant capital expenditures. Continued adverse conditions in the credit markets in future years could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings or renewals or refinancings.  Gallagher also has a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which it places insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, Gallagher could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to Gallagher, which could have a significant adverse impact on Gallagher’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations.  The agreements and instruments governing Gallagher’s debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact Gallagher’s ability to operate its business.  The agreements governing Gallagher’s debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict Gallagher’s ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change Gallagher’s business or make investments.  The restrictions in the agreements governing Gallagher’s debt may prevent it from taking actions that it believes would be in the best interest of Gallagher’s business and its stockholders and may make it difficult for Gallagher to execute its business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. Gallagher may also incur future debt obligations that might subject it to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect Gallagher’s financial and operational flexibility. Gallagher cannot make any assurances that it will be able to refinance its debt on terms acceptable to Gallagher, or at all.  Gallagher’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing Gallagher’s debt may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond Gallagher’s control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest.  Gallagher could incur substantial losses if one of the commercial banks and financial institutions Gallagher uses in its operations would happen to fail.  Gallagher maintains cash balances, including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts, and in some cases, in excess of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits at various depository institutions. Gallagher also maintains cash balances in foreign banks and institutions. Although Gallagher has moved substantially all of its U.S. funds into accounts insured or guaranteed by government programs, there are foreign operations where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs. As the worldwide fallout from the credit crisis persists, the financial strength of some depository institutions has diminished and this trend may continue. If one or more of the depository institutions in which Gallagher maintains significant cash balances were to fail, Gallagher’s ability to access these funds might be temporarily or permanently limited, and Gallagher could face a significant liquidity problem and potentially material financial losses.    11    Table of Contents Gallagher has historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies. Gallagher may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions.  In the past several years, Gallagher has completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth and Gallagher believes that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in Gallagher achieving slower growth. Various factors may affect Gallagher’s ability to attract acquisition targets, including Gallagher’s inability to continue certain contingent commission compensation structures, particularly in light of the fact that most other companies in the insurance brokerage industry are not limited in this manner. Moreover, even if Gallagher is able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, it may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows Gallagher to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, thereby negatively affecting Gallagher’s results of operations or leading to unanticipated contingent liabilities and losses.  Gallagher faces a variety of risks in its Risk Management operations that are distinct from those it faces in its Brokerage operations.  Gallagher’s Risk Management business has somewhat less exposure to the hard and soft market cycles described above to which Gallagher’s Brokerage business is exposed; however, it faces a variety of other risks which are unique to its operations, including:        •    The risk that the favorable trend among insureds toward outsourcing of various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing Gallagher to experience reduced revenues or a reduced rate of revenue growth;        •    The risk that contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on its services will be decreased due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments;        •    The risk that Gallagher cannot satisfy regulatory requirements on third party administrators or that regulatory developments will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make its business less attractive; and        •    The risk that Gallagher cannot control its labor and technology costs in such a manner as to remain competitive in the marketplace for claims administration and risk management services and fulfill its existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection) in a cost-efficient and profitable manner.  Gallagher has significant non-U.S. operations which expose it to certain additional risks, including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk.  A significant portion of Gallagher’s operations is conducted outside the U.S. Accordingly, Gallagher is subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries. Operating in these countries may present risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks to Gallagher of doing comparable business in the U.S. Gallagher’s international operations may be subject to a number of risks, including:        •    Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;        •    Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit Gallagher’s ability to prohibit employees from competing with Gallagher after their employment, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;        •    Political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);        •    Coordinating Gallagher’s communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones;        •    Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and laws;        •    Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which Gallagher operates;        •    Adverse changes in tax rates;        •    Legal or political constraints on Gallagher’s ability to maintain or increase prices;        •    Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to Gallagher from its operations outside the U.S.; and        •    Burdens of complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues.    12    Table of Contents Some of Gallagher’s foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Gallagher must also translate the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although Gallagher has used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations.  Gallagher also operates in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the U.S. and more stable countries. Gallagher’s operations in these countries may be temporarily or permanently disrupted by adverse geopolitical or economic conditions in these locations. For example, Gallagher uses third-party service providers located in India for certain back office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected Gallagher’s operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect Gallagher’s operations or ability to utilize third-party providers in the future. Should Gallagher’s access to these services be disrupted, Gallagher’s business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Changes in Gallagher’s accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect its financial position and operating results.  Gallagher prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These accounting principles require Gallagher to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its Consolidated Financial Statements. Gallagher is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. Gallagher periodically evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of intangible assets, investments, income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. Gallagher bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that Gallagher believes to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on Gallagher’s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  Gallagher is subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide. If Gallagher fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects Gallagher’s operations, Gallagher may not be able to conduct its business or may be less profitable.  Many of Gallagher’s activities are subject to regulatory supervision. Failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary actions that may include requiring clients to be compensated for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of Gallagher’s authorization to operate. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time-to-time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder Gallagher’s ability to operate its business.  Government sponsored insurance programs may seriously undermine Gallagher’s profitability.  It is possible that Federal and state governments will create P/C or health related insurance programs that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers. Development of these government-sponsored insurance programs could adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition.  Gallagher is subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to Gallagher, would adversely affect its financial results.  Gallagher is subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that its employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that Gallagher holds for its clients on a fiduciary basis. Gallagher has established provisions against these potential matters which it believes to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and Gallagher adjusts such provisions from time-to-time based on current material developments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to Gallagher, it could materially adversely affect its future financial results. In addition, Gallagher’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future Gallagher’s insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which it self-insures. Gallagher has purchased errors and omissions (E&O) insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time-to-time as current developments warrant.    13    Table of Contents As more fully described in Note 17 to Gallagher’s 2008 Consolidated Financial Statements, Gallagher is subject to a number of legal proceedings, regulatory actions and other contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on Gallagher’s business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on Gallagher by exposing it to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to Gallagher’s client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources.  Gallagher is subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings concerning contingent broker compensation practices. Further proceedings could adversely affect Gallagher’s financial strength and results of operations.  Since late 2004, the insurance industry in general, and Gallagher individually, have been subject to significant scrutiny by various State Attorneys General, state insurance departments and private litigants with respect to broker compensation practices (generally known as contingent commission arrangements or placement service agreements) between insurance brokers and insurance carriers.  On May 18, 2005, Gallagher resolved with the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and the Director of Insurance of the State of Illinois, an investigation into broker compensation practices. Gallagher believes that this settlement was intended to be on behalf of all State Attorneys General and all state insurance departments. However, there can be no assurance that other states will honor this agreement.  On December 29, 2006, Gallagher reached an agreement to resolve all claims in the MDL. On September 4, 2007, the court granted final approval of the MDL Settlement. The MDL Settlement provides for Gallagher to distribute $28.0 million to current and former clients and others that purchased retail insurance through Gallagher or other brokers named as defendants in the MDL during the period beginning on August 26, 1994 and ending on December 31, 2005. Gallagher also agreed to pay up to $8.9 million in attorney fees, of which Gallagher paid $8.6 million in November 2007. A notice of appeal has been filed challenging the final approval of the MDL Settlement. A hearing on the appeal is scheduled for April 20, 2009. In the event that the final approval by the court is not upheld, Gallagher may incur significant additional legal costs and face potential liability in connection with the litigation.  The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained. Future litigation and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on Gallagher. Gallagher’s future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. In addition, even if Gallagher does not experience significant monetary costs, there has been and may continue to be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to Gallagher or to the insurance brokerage industry in general that may adversely affect Gallagher’s business.  For a more detailed discussion of these matters refer to Note 17 to Gallagher’s 2008 Consolidated Financial Statements.  Gallagher’s results may be adversely affected relative to its competitors that can accept contingent commissions.  Pursuant to various agreements with insurance regulators, Gallagher, Marsh, Willis and Aon are prohibited from accepting volume-based or profit-based contingent commissions as a retail broker. There are no other brokers that are known to be similarly prohibited from accepting these types of contingent commissions. When Gallagher acquires a retail broker, that broker may continue to accept contingent commissions for a three year period after the acquisition date. Gallagher’s restrictions on accepting contingent commissions may significantly undermine Gallagher’s operating results, profitability, liquidity and its ability to reinvest in its business relative to its competitors that can accept contingent commissions.  Gallagher’s future success depends, in part, on its ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.  Gallagher believes that its future success depends, in part, on its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including its senior management, brokers and other key personnel. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers, and Gallagher has lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of any of its senior managers, brokers or other key personnel, or its inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect Gallagher’s business, operating results and financial condition.    14    Table of Contents Gallagher has historically benefited from Section 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting Gallagher to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits related to Gallagher’s synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. In 2008, 2007 and 2006, Gallagher’s annual effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was 31.9%, 22.7% and 16.9%, respectively. Gallagher’s overall effective income tax rate for 2007 and 2006 reflects the tax credits generated by investments in limited partnerships that operated alternative energy projects (IRC Section 29). The rates for 2008 and 2007 reflect the impact of the resolution of a number of income tax matters related to prior years and revisions to estimates of uncertain tax positions, which resulted in a net decrease in Gallagher’s tax provision of $16.3 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Accordingly, Gallagher’s overall effective income tax rate in 2009 and future years will likely adjust upward to be in the range of approximately 39.0% to 41.0%.  Gallagher believes its claim for IRC Section 29-related related tax credits is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings (PLRs) previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related partnerships in which it had an interest. Gallagher understands these PLRs are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and has received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them.  While Gallagher’s synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause Gallagher to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29-related tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Gallagher is exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by its Financial Services business.  Gallagher’s Financial Services business holds a variety of investments. These investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes, including general overall economic conditions, the effects of changes in interest rates, various regulatory issues, credit risk, potential litigation, tax audits and disputes, failure to monetize in an effective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. Any of these consequences may diminish the value of Gallagher’s invested assets and adversely affect its net worth and profitability.   Item 2. Properties.
