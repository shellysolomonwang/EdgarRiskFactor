Item 1A. Risk Factors.    Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine Gallagher’s profitability.    Gallagher derives much of its revenue from commissions and fees for brokerage and risk management services. Gallagher does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. For example, for an extended period of years through late 2000, heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations resulted in flat or reduced premium rates (a “soft” market), which in turn put downward pressure on Gallagher’s commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas. After this period of time, the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market, in which premium rates were stable or increasing. This trend was accentuated by the events of September 11th, following which insurance coverage in many lines became less available and premium rates increased, in some cases dramatically. More recently, during 2004 and 2005, the market softened again in many lines and in many geographic areas. However, the abnormally high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in those years has hardened the market in certain geographic areas and business lines. Because of these market fluctuations for insurance products, which Gallagher cannot predict or control, its brokerage revenues and profitability may be volatile.    In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While Gallagher historically has been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of its customers, and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that Gallagher will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as what is realized from its traditional brokerage activities.    Gallagher’s results may be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully implement a new business compensation model.    In October 2004, Gallagher announced that, effective January 1, 2005, it would not enter into any new volume-based or profit-based contingent commissions agreements as a retail broker. In connection with the elimination of contingent commissions, Gallagher established a new business compensation model and commission structure. This business compensation model and commission structure remains in its early stages, and there can be no assurance that it will generate incremental commission revenues equivalent to those previously received from contingent commissions. The inability to generate adequate revenues from Gallagher’s new business compensation model and commission structure may significantly undermine Gallagher’s operating results and profitability.    Gallagher is subject to a number of investigations and legal proceedings concerning contingent compensation, other industry practices and certain conduct, which, if determined unfavorably to Gallagher, could adversely affect its financial strength and results of operations.    Private parties have filed civil litigation against Gallagher under a variety of legal theories relating, among other things, to broker compensation practices. Gallagher is named as a defendant in a purported class action lawsuit pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, which challenges the propriety of alleged “undisclosed contingent commissions” paid pursuant to certain compensation arrangements between Gallagher and various insurance carriers. Additionally, Gallagher is one of a number of insurance brokerage and insurance company defendants in a Multi-District Litigation proceeding before the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and is party to various other litigation matters. Additionally, the insurance industry in general, and Gallagher individually, continue to be the subjects of a significant level of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies, including State Attorneys General and the departments of insurance for various states, with respect to contingent commission arrangements. On May 18, 2005, Gallagher and its subsidiaries and affiliates, except for Gallagher Bassett Services, Inc., entered into an Assurance of Voluntary Compliance (the AVC) with the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and the Director of Insurance of the State of Illinois (collectively, the IL State Agencies) to resolve all of the issues related to investigations conducted by the IL State Agencies, pursuant to which it paid $26.9 million into a fund to be distributed to eligible retail customers by March 31, 2006, and agreed to undertake certain business changes. For a more detailed discussion of these matters refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher’s 2005 Financial Statements.    The ultimate outcome of the matters referred to above and similar matters cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on Gallagher. Gallagher’s future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. In addition, even if Gallagher does not experience significant monetary costs, there has been and may continue to be adverse publicity associated with these matters that could result in reputational harm to Gallagher or to the insurance brokerage industry in general that may adversely affect Gallagher’s business.    9    Table of Contents Gallagher faces significant competitive pressures in each of its businesses.    The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with Gallagher in one or more areas of its business. Gallagher competes with three firms that are as large or significantly larger than Gallagher in global risk management and brokerage markets. In addition, there are various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality and may have, in that region or locality, an office that is as large or larger than the particular local office of Gallagher. Gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect Gallagher’s business.    In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect Gallagher. These developments include:        •   an increase in capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry which in turn may lead to a soft market and lower insurance premiums and commissions;        •   the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;        •   changes in Gallagher’s business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments;        •   the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative markets types of coverage;        •   an increase in competition from newly-formed or existing insurance brokers who have not agreed to limit their use of contingent commission arrangements, thereby giving them a competitive advantage over those brokers, such as Gallagher, which have agreed to limit the use of such arrangements; and        •   the creation of in-house servicing capabilities by insurance companies or by certain insurance consumers which compete with the third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products offered by Gallagher’s Risk Management Segment.    New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for Gallagher’s products and services to change, which could in turn could adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations and financial condition.    Gallagher faces a variety of risks from its Gallagher Bassett Services operations which are distinct from those it faces in its brokerage operations.    Gallagher’s Risk Management Segment, which accounted for approximately 25% of Gallagher’s total 2005 revenues, operates primarily through its subsidiary, Gallagher Bassett Services (GB). GB is a third party administrator and risk consultant that provides a range of risk management services, including claims management, risk control consulting services, information management and property appraisals. While GB’s business has little exposure to the hard and soft market cycles described above to which Gallagher’s brokerage business is exposed, GB faces a variety of other risks which are unique to its operations, including:        •   the risk that the favorable trend among insureds toward outsourcing of various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing GB to experience reduced revenues or a reduced rate of revenue growth;        •   the risk that contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on GB’s services will be decreased due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments;        •   the risk that GB cannot satisfy regulatory requirements on third party administrators or that regulatory developments will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make GB’s business less attractive; and        •   the risk that GB cannot control its labor and technology costs in such a manner as to remain competitive in the marketplace for claims administration and risk management services and to conclude its existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection) in a cost-efficient and profitable manner.    10    Table of Contents Gallagher’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings.    Gallagher may be subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Because Gallagher often assists clients with matters involving substantial amounts of money, including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims, errors and omissions claims against Gallagher may arise which allege potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Claimants may seek large damage awards and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs.    Gallagher purchases insurance to provide protection from errors and omissions claims that may arise in the ordinary course of business, subject to self-insured deductibles and limits. As of December 31, 2005, the amount of Gallagher’s deductible and limit for claims were $5.0 million and $155.0 million, respectively. Gallagher’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, its insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is a general increase in the number or amounts of claims to which Gallagher is exposed. Gallagher’s future ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles and limits it desires may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or Gallagher’s own claims experience. In addition, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may harm Gallagher’s reputation or divert management resources away from operating its business.    Gallagher historically has engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies. Gallagher may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions.    In the past several years, Gallagher has completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Gallagher’s acquisition program has been an important part of its historical growth and Gallagher believes that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in Gallagher achieving slower growth. Various factors may affect Gallagher’s ability to attract acquisition targets, including Gallagher’s inability to continue certain contingent commission compensation structures, particularly in light of the fact that certain other companies in the insurance brokerage industry are not limited in this manner. Moreover, even if Gallagher is able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, it may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner which allows Gallagher to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, thereby negatively affecting Gallagher’s results of operations or leading to unanticipated contingent liabilities and losses.    Gallagher is subject to insurance industry regulation worldwide. If Gallagher fails to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects Gallagher’s operations, Gallagher may not be able to conduct its business or may be less profitable.    Many of Gallagher’s activities are subject to regulatory supervision. Failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to disciplinary action, that may include requiring clients to be compensated for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of Gallagher’s authorization to operate. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time-to-time require operational changes which could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder Gallagher’s ability to operate its business.    Gallagher’s future success depends, in part, on its ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.    Gallagher believes that its future success depends, in part, on its ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including its senior management, brokers and other key personnel. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers, and Gallagher has lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of any of its senior managers, brokers or other key personnel, or its inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect Gallagher’s business, operating results and financial condition.    11    Table of Contents Gallagher has significant non-U.S. operations which expose it to certain additional risks, including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk.    A significant portion of Gallagher’s operations is conducted outside the U.S. Accordingly, Gallagher is subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries. Operating in these countries may present risks that are different from, or greater than, risks to Gallagher of doing comparable business in the U.S.    Some of Gallagher’s foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Gallagher must also translate the financial results of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although Gallagher implemented a foreign currency hedging strategy in 2005, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect Gallagher’s results of operations.    Gallagher also operates in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the U.S. and more established countries. Gallagher’s operations in these countries may be temporarily or permanently disrupted by adverse geopolitical or economic conditions in these locations. For example, Gallagher uses a third-party service provider located in India for certain back office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected Gallagher’s infrastructure in India. However, such factors could potentially affect Gallagher’s infrastructure or ability to utilize third-party providers in the future. Should Gallagher’s access to these services be disrupted, Gallagher’s business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.    Gallagher is exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by its Financial Services business.    Gallagher’s Financial Services business holds a variety of investments, including (i) an interest in a holding company that holds interests in private investment management firms, (ii) early-stage loans, partnership interests relating to low income housing developments and an ownership interest in a low income housing developer and syndicator, (iii) investments in partnerships formed to develop energy that qualifies for tax credits under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 29 and (iv) certain other real estate and other investments. These investments are subject to risk of impairment due to a variety of causes, including general overall economic conditions, the effects of changes in interest rates, various regulatory issues, credit risk, failure to monetize in an effective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. Any of these consequences may diminish the value of Gallagher’s invested assets and adversely affect its net worth and profitability.    Gallagher has historically benefited from Section 29 tax credits. The disallowance or termination of Section 29 tax credits, or the loss of all or part of its Section 29 tax credits due to phase out of such credits, would decrease Gallagher’s revenues, increase its costs, increase its effective tax rate and decrease its income.    Under current law, IRC Section 29 tax credits are not available for synthetic fuel sold after December 31, 2007, and, if the law is not extended, Gallagher’s effective federal income tax rate in 2008 will likely adjust upward to fall within a range of approximately 35.0% to 42.0%. In addition, there have been initiatives from time-to-time to consider the early repeal or modification of IRC Section 29, and the IRS is continuing to audit taxpayers claiming Syn/Coal Credits with respect to a variety of issues. In addition, through December 31, 2007, IRC Section 29 has a phase-out provision that is triggered when domestic crude oil reaches certain “Phase-out Prices” as determined by the IRS. For calendar year 2006, Gallagher estimates that the commonly reported crude oil price (NYMEX price) would need to average approximately $60.00 per barrel for calendar 2006 for any phase-out to begin and average approximately $74.00 per barrel for calendar 2006 for a complete phase-out. The average daily NYMEX Price for 2006 through January 30 was $65.41 per barrel.    There can be no assurance that future oil prices will be below future phase-out levels. Should Gallagher or its partners anticipate that oil prices may reach the range of Phase-out Prices in 2006 or in 2007, some or all of Gallagher’s IRC Section 29 operations could be curtailed, resulting in Gallagher losing tax credits, realizing a higher effective tax rate for federal income tax purposes and triggering indemnification payment obligations under various agreements which Gallagher has with its investment partners. For further information about the negative effects these contingencies could have on Gallagher’s results of operations, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is included in Gallagher’s 2005 Financial Statements under the caption entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and is incorporated herein by reference.    12    Table of Contents  Item 2.
