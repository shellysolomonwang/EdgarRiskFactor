Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Risks Relating to our Business Generally  An economic downturn, as well as uncertainty regarding the European debt crisis and market perceptions concerning the instability of the Euro, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  An overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. Such reductions could also adversely impact future commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. We record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known and, as a result, any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. In addition, some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, or be acquired by other companies, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  We also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our clients, overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability. The failure of an insurer with whom we place business could also result in errors and omissions claims against us by our clients, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    8    Table of Contents Despite a recent agreement by European Union officials on a system to wind down failed banks, continued concerns regarding the ability of certain European countries to service their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets. A potential consequence may be stagnant growth, or even recession, in the Eurozone economies and beyond, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The market instability caused by the Eurozone debt crisis has led to questions regarding the future viability of the Euro as a single currency for the region. The dissolution of the Euro (in the extreme case) could lead to further contraction in the Eurozone economies, adversely affecting our results of operations. In addition, the value of our assets held in the Eurozone, including cash holdings, would decline if currencies in the region were devalued.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.  We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. For example, after three years of a “hard” market that began in late 2000 and was strengthened by the events of September 11th, 2001, in which premium rates were stable or increasing, in late 2003 the market experienced the return of flat or reduced premium rates (a “soft” market) in many lines and geographic areas. This put downward pressure on our commission revenues. In 2012 and 2013, the market began “firming” (as opposed to traditional “hardening”) across many lines and geographic areas. In this environment, rates increased at a moderate pace, clients could still obtain coverage, businesses continued to stay in standard-line markets and there was adequate capacity in the market. It is not clear whether this firming is sustainable given the uncertainty of the current economic environment. Because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, we may have to adjust our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.  In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While, historically, we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities. Our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may also be challenged by the growing desire of some clients to compensate brokers based upon flat fees rather than variable commission rates. This could negatively impact us because fees are generally not indexed for inflation and do not automatically increase with premium as does commission-based compensation.  We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.  The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations, as well as individuals, actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world. We compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours. In addition, various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular country, region or locality may have, in that country, region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. Our risk management operation also faces significant competition from stand-alone firms as well as divisions of larger firms.  We believe that the primary factors in determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business.  In addition, any increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:        •    Increased capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions;        •    Insurance companies selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;    9    Table of Contents     •    Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (for example, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation);        •    Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, that compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers; and        •    Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms and consulting firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We have historically acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefits consulting firms and risk management firms. We may not be able to continue such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.  Historically, we have acquired large numbers of insurance brokers, benefits consulting firms and risk management firms. Our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be important to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely would result in us achieving slower growth. Continuing consolidation in our industry and growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers on the part of private equity firms and private equity-backed consolidators could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make them more expensive. Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not be able to execute transactions on favorable terms or integrate targets in a manner that allows us to realize the benefits we have historically experienced from acquisitions. Our ability to finance and integrate acquisitions may also decrease if we complete a greater number of large acquisitions than we have historically.  Post-acquisition risks include those relating to retention of personnel, entry into unfamiliar markets, unanticipated contingencies or liabilities (such as violations of sanctions laws or anti-corruption laws including the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act) tax and accounting issues, and integration difficulties, relating to accounting, information technology, human resources, or organizational culture and fit, some or all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth. Post-acquisition deterioration of targets could also result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or goodwill impairment charges.  We own interests in firms where we do not exercise management control (such as Casanueva Perez S.A.P. de C.V. (Grupo CP) in Mexico) and are therefore unable to direct or manage the business to realize the anticipated benefits, including mitigation of risks, that could be achieved through full integration.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.  We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including our senior management, brokers and other key personnel. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers, and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers, brokers or other key personnel (including the key personnel that manage our interests in our IRC Section 45 investments), or our inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Our growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the U.S.  We conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the U.S., including in countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the U.S. and more stable countries. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries. For example, we have operations in India to provide certain back-office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect our operations there in the future. Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Operating outside the U.S. may also present other risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the U.S. These include, among others, risks relating to:        •    Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad. These include rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Union and the United Nations, trade sanction laws such as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, the requirements of the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate (such as the U.K. Bribery Act), as well as unexpected changes in such regulatory requirements and laws;    10    Table of Contents     •    Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;        •    Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;        •    Political and economic instability (including the potential dissolution of the Euro, acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);        •    Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during times of crisis management;        •    Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of the U.S. or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;        •    Adverse changes in tax rates or discriminatory or confiscatory taxation in foreign jurisdictions;        •    Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;        •    Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs; and        •    Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the U.S.  If any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations.  Our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations, including the risk that:        •    The favorable trend among both insurers and insureds toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline;        •    Concentration of large amounts of revenue with certain clients results in greater exposure to the potential negative effects of changes in management at such clients or changes in state government policies, in the case of our government-entity clients;        •    Contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments;        •    We will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments (including unanticipated regulatory developments relating to security and data privacy outside the United States) will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;        •    Continued economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims we process;        •    If we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection);        •    We may be unable to develop further efficiencies in our claims-handling business if we fail to make adequate improvements in technology or operations; and        •    Insurance companies or certain insurance consumers may create in-house servicing capabilities that compete with our third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products.  If any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions, and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations.  A portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies. Contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria. If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves (over which we have no control), actual contingent commissions and/or supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.    11    Table of Contents Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability.  The cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. In the past, we have occasionally experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.  If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies and effective internal controls through the application of technology and related tools, our client relationships, growth strategy, compliance programs and operating results could be adversely affected.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards, client preferences and internal control standards. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. For example, certain of our competitors have launched consulting operations that leverage global insurance placement data. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors, or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies or product offerings, we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships, growth strategy, compliance programs and operating results.  Our inability to recover successfully should we experience a disaster, material cybersecurity attack or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. For example, our risk management segment is highly dependent on the continued and efficient functioning of RISX-FACS®, our proprietary risk management information system, to provide clients with insurance claim settlement and administration services. Disruptions could be caused by, among other things, restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, material cybersecurity attacks, or outages to electrical, communications or other services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. We have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies. However, such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients or increase in claims and lawsuits directed against us because of any period during which we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Regulatory, Legal and Accounting Risks  We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business or may be less profitable.  Many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision, including insurance industry regulation, Federal and state employment regulation and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Department of Justice (DOJ) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the U.S., and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the U.K. Such regulations could reduce our profitability or growth by increasing the costs of compliance, restricting the products or services we sell, the markets we enter, the methods by which we sell our products and services, or the prices we can charge for our services and the form of compensation we can accept from our clients, carriers and third parties. As our operations grow around the world, it is increasingly difficult to monitor and enforce regulatory compliance across the organization. A compliance failure by even one of our smallest branches could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In all such cases, we would also likely incur significant internal investigation costs.  In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, we offer captive design and management services and group captive development services, and expect to be able to continue offering such services. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has established a subgroup to study the use of captives and special purpose vehicles to transfer insurance risk in relation to existing state laws and regulations. Any action by Federal, state or other regulators that adversely affects our ability to offer services in relation to captives, either retroactively or prospectively, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, the method by which insurance brokers are compensated has received substantial scrutiny in the past decade because of the potential for conflicts of interest. Adverse regulatory developments regarding the forms of compensation we can receive (for example, continent commissions), could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    12    Table of Contents We could be adversely affected by violations or alleged violations of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-corruption laws.  The FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments (to foreign officials and otherwise) and require companies to keep accurate books and records and maintain appropriate internal controls. Our training program and policies mandate compliance with such laws. We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. In recent years, two of the five publicly traded insurance brokerage firms were investigated in the U.K. by the FSA, and one was investigated in the U.S. by the SEC and DOJ, for improper payments to foreign officials. These firms paid significant settlements and undertook internal investigations. If we are alleged to have violated or found to be liable for violations of anti-corruption laws (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others, including employees of our third party partners or agents), we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, incur significant internal investigation costs and suffer reputational harm.  Our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation.  The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees, and continues to be amended through regulations issued by various government agencies. Many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. We have made significant investments in product and knowledge development to assist clients as they navigate the complex requirements of this legislation. Depending on future changes to health legislation, these investments may not yield returns. In addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employee benefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this law, particularly the “employer mandate” scheduled to enter into effect in January 2015, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.  We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.  We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured, provide clients with appropriate consulting and claims handling services, or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. We have established provisions against these potential matters that we believe are adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if, in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant.  As more fully described in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to a number of legal proceedings, regulatory actions and other contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our ability to recruit quality brokers and other significant employees to our business, and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.  If our clients are not satisfied with our services, we may face additional cost, loss of profit opportunities and damage to our professional reputation.  We depend, to a large extent, on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high-quality brokerage and risk management services, so that we can understand our clients’ needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to their needs. If a client is not satisfied with our services, it may be more damaging to our business than to other businesses and could    13    Table of Contents  cause us to incur additional costs and impair profitability. Many of our clients are businesses that band together in industry groups and/or trade associations and actively share information amongst themselves about the quality of service they receive from their vendors. Accordingly, poor service to one client may negatively impact our relationships with multiple other clients.  The nature of much of our work, especially our actuarial services in our benefits consulting business, involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events, the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance. Similarly, in our institutional investment consulting and our retirement services consulting businesses, we may be measured based on our track record regarding judgments and advice on investments that are susceptible to influences unknown at the time the advice was given. In addition, we could make computational, software programming or data entry or management errors. A client may nonetheless claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice. In addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums, claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business and adversely affect our ability to secure new business.  Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation.  One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information from threats such as a cybersecurity attack. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. In the past, we have experienced attempts to wrongfully access our computer and information systems, which, if successful, could have resulted in harm to our business. Our systems were successful in identifying the risk and preventing unauthorized access, and management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material effect on our operations. However, there can be no assurance that cybersecurity incidents that could have a material impact on our business will not occur.  Data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations that sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services, and may be more stringent in some jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability, fines and penalties, and could damage our reputation.  Significant changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments (including our IRC Section 45 investments), income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.  Risks Relating to our Investments, Debt and Common Stock  Our clean energy investments are subject to various risks and uncertainties.  We have invested in clean energy operations capable of producing refined coal that we believe qualify for tax credits under IRC Section 45.  See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of these investments. Our ability to generate returns and avoid write-offs in connection with these investments is subject to various risks and uncertainties. These include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties as set forth below.        •    Availability of the tax credits under IRC Section 45. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon the operations in which we have invested satisfying certain ongoing conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. These include, among others, the emissions reduction, “qualifying technology”, and “placed-in-service” requirements of IRC Section 45, as well as the requirement that at least one of the operations’ owners qualifies as a “producer” of refined    14    Table of Contents       coal. While we have received some degree of confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, the IRS could ultimately determine that the operations have not satisfied, or have not continued to satisfy, the conditions set forth in IRC Section 45. Additionally, Congress could modify or repeal IRC Section 45 and remove the tax credits retroactively.        •    Business risks. We are working to negotiate and finalize arrangements with potential co-investors for the purchase of equity stakes in one or more of the operations that are not currently producing refined coal. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could have difficulty finding replacements in a timely manner. We could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, causes our interests and those of our co-investors to diverge. Finally, our partners responsible for operation and management could fail to run the operations in compliance with IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, our investment returns may be negatively impacted.        •    Operational risks. Chem-Mod’s multi-pollutant reduction technologies (The Chem-ModTM Solution) require chemicals that may not be readily available in the marketplace at reasonable costs. Utilities that use the technologies could be idled for various reasons, including operational or environmental problems at the plants or in the boilers, disruptions in the supply or transportation of coal, revocation of their Chem-Mod technologies environmental permits, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede the operations. Long-term operations using Chem-Mod’s multi-pollutant reduction technologies could also lead to unforeseen technical or other problems not evident in the short- or medium-term. A serious injury or death of a worker connected with the production of refined coal using Chem-Mod’s technologies could expose the operations to material liabilities, jeopardizing our investment, and could lead to reputational harm. In the event of any such operational problems, we may not be able to take full advantage of the tax credits.        •    Market demand for coal. When the price of natural gas and/or oil declines relative to that of coal, some utilities may choose to burn natural gas or oil instead of coal. Market demand for coal may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. Sustained low natural gas prices may also cause utilities to phase out or close existing coal-fired power plants. If utilities burn less coal or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, the availability of the tax credits would also be reduced.        •    Incompatible coal. If utilities purchase coal of a quality or type incompatible with their boilers and operations, treating such coal through a commercial refined coal plant could magnify the negative impacts of burning such coal. As a result, refined coal plants at such utilities may be removed from production until the incompatible coal has all been burned, which could cause us to be unable to take full advantage of the tax credits.        •    IRC Section 45 phase out provisions. IRC Section 45 contains phase out provisions based upon the market price of coal, such that, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.        •    Environmental concerns regarding coal. Environmental concerns about greenhouse gases, toxic wastewater discharges and the potential hazardous nature of coal combustion waste could lead to regulations that discourage the burning of coal. For example, such regulations could mandate that electric power generating companies purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal. This could result in utilities burning less coal, which would reduce the generation of tax credits.        •    Moving a commercial refined coal plant. Changes in circumstances, such as those described above, may cause a commercial refined coal plant to be moved to a different power generation facility, which could require us to invest additional capital.        •    Demand for commercial refined coal plants. The implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permitting requirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the Environmental Protection Agency could negatively impact power generational facilities’ demand for commercial refined coal plants, should we need to move them as described above.        •    Intellectual property risks. Other companies may make claims of intellectual property infringement with respect to The Chem-Mod™ Solution. Such intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) obtain a license to use the intellectual property, which might not be obtainable on favorable terms, if at all. If Chem-Mod (or we and our investment and operational partners) cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, the operations may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod™ Solution.        •    Strategic alternatives risk. While we currently expect to continue to hold at least a portion of these refined coal investments, if for any reason in the future we decide to sell more of our interests, the discount rate on future cash flows could be excessive, and could result in an impairment on our investment.    15    Table of Contents The IRC Section 45 operations in which we have invested and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs.  The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using The Chem-Mod™ Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem-Mod™ Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod™ Solution. For example, we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod™ Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We have historically benefited from IRC Section 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related limited liability companies in which we had an interest. We understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them. However, while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29 tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  We are exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by our corporate segment.  Our corporate segment holds a variety of investments. These investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes, including general overall economic conditions, the effects of changes in interest rates, various regulatory issues, credit risk, potential litigation, tax audits and disputes, failure to monetize in an effective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. Any of these consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability. Additionally, our cash holdings, including cash held in our fiduciary capacity, are subject to the credit, liquidity and other risks faced by our financial institution counterparties.  The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.  The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments.  The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.    16    Table of Contents A failure to comply with the restrictions under the agreements governing our debt could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  In the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership.  We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. Should we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages in our company.  Volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders.  The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:        •    General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism;        •    Quarterly variations in our operating results;        •    Seasonality of our business cycle;        •    Changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;        •    Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;        •    Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the financial services industry in general;        •    Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;        •    News reports relating to trends in our markets, including any expectations regarding an upcoming “hard” or “soft” market;        •    Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;        •    Material announcements by us or our competitors;        •    The impact or perceived impact of developments relating to our investments, including the possible perception by securities analysts or investors that such investments divert management attention from our core operations;        •    Quarter-to-quarter volatility in the earnings impact of IRC Section 45 tax credits from our clean energy investments, due to the application of accounting standards applicable to the recognition of tax credits; and        •    Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur.  Shareholder class action lawsuits may be instituted against us following a period of volatility in our stock price. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.  Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
