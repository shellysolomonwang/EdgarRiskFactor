Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Volatility or declines in premiums or other adverse trends in the insurance industry may seriously undermine our profitability.  We derive much of our revenue from commissions and fees for our brokerage services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Moreover, insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. For example, for several years through late 2000, heavy competition for market share among insurance carriers, increased underwriting capacity and improved economies of scale following consolidations, resulted in flat or reduced premium rates (a “soft” market), which in turn put downward pressure on our commission revenue in many lines and in many geographic areas. Beginning in late 2000, the insurance industry transitioned to a “hard” market, in which premium rates were stable or increasing. Because of the events of September 11th, many insurance lines became less available and premium rates increased, in some cases dramatically. Beginning in late 2003, the market softened again in many lines and geographic areas. While the high level of hurricane activity and other natural disasters in 2004 and 2005 caused a hard market in certain coastal areas, the low level of hurricane activity in 2006 and 2007 caused carriers to again become rate/price sensitive and the industry has remained in a soft market across most geographical areas and business lines. The higher level of hurricane activity in 2008 generally did not cause the carriers to deviate from the trends noted in 2006 and 2007. Because of these market cycles for insurance product pricing, which we cannot predict or control, our brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile or remain depressed for significant periods of time.  As traditional risk-bearing insurance companies continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as us, those insurance companies may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, we cannot accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, our budgets for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures may have to be adjusted to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.  In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, greater levels of self-insurance, captives, rent-a-captives, risk retention groups and non-insurance capital markets-based solutions to traditional insurance. While historically we have been able to participate in certain of these activities on behalf of our customers and obtain fee revenue for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from our traditional brokerage activities.    8    Table of Contents We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.  The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and many insurance brokerage and service organizations, as well as individuals, actively compete with us in one or more areas of our business around the world. We compete with three firms in the global risk management and brokerage markets that have revenues significantly larger than ours. In addition, various other competing firms that operate nationally or that are strong in a particular region or locality may have, in that region or locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to our clients. Losing business to competitors offering similar products at lower prices or having other competitive advantages would adversely affect our business.  In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:        •    Increased capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new capital in the industry, which in turn may lead to lower insurance premiums and commissions;        •    Insurance companies selling insurance directly to insureds without the involvement of a broker or other intermediary;        •    Changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory developments (including developments relating to the medical loss ratio requirements of the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation);        •    Federal and state governments establishing programs to provide health insurance or, in certain cases, property insurance in catastrophe-prone areas or other alternative market types of coverage, which compete with, or completely replace, insurance products offered by insurance carriers;        •    Increased competition from new market participants such as banks, accounting firms and consulting firms offering risk management or insurance brokerage services; and        •    Insurance companies or certain insurance consumers creating in-house servicing capabilities that compete with the third party administration and other administration, servicing and risk management products our risk management segment offers.  New competition as a result of these or other competitive or industry developments could cause the demand for our products and services to decrease, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  A continuation or worsening of the recent economic recession, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  The general deterioration in the economy, which began in fourth quarter 2008, could adversely impact us in future years as a result of reductions in the overall amount of insurance coverage that our clients purchase due to reductions in their headcount, payroll, properties, and the market values of assets, among other factors. Such reductions could also adversely impact our 2011 commission revenues when the carriers perform exposure audits if they lead to subsequent downward premium adjustments. We record the income effects of subsequent premium adjustments when the adjustments become known, and, as a result, any improvement in our results of operations and financial condition may lag an improvement in the economy. In addition, some of our clients may cease operations completely in the event of a prolonged deterioration in the economy, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also have a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from some of the insurance companies with which we place insurance. If those insurance companies experience liquidity problems or other financial difficulties, we could encounter delays or defaults in payments owed to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if a significant insurer fails or withdraws from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our client, overall capacity in the industry could be negatively affected, which could reduce our placement of certain lines and types of insurance and, as a result, reduce our revenues and profitability. The failure of an insurer with whom we places business could also result in errors and omissions claims by our clients, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We have historically engaged in a large number of acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies. We may not be able to continue to implement such an acquisition strategy in the future and there are risks associated with such acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth strategy and results of operations.  In the past several years, we have completed numerous acquisitions of insurance brokers and agencies and may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Our acquisition program has been an important part of our historical growth and we believe that similar acquisition activity will be critical to maintaining comparable growth in the future. Failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions likely will result in us achieving slower growth. Moreover, even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not be able to execute acquisition transactions on favorable terms or integrate such targets following acquisition in a manner that allows us to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. Our acquisitions pose the risk of post-acquisition deterioration, which could result in lower or negative earnings contribution and/or goodwill impairment charges. Additionally, we may incur or assume unanticipated liabilities or contingencies in connection with our acquisitions (including, for example, liabilities relating to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (which we refer to as FCPA) violations when we acquire businesses with international operations). If any of these developments occur, our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected.    9    Table of Contents Our growing international operations expose us to risks different than those we face in the United States, including the risk of exchange rate fluctuations and geopolitical risk.  We conduct a growing portion of our operations outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries. Operating in these countries may present risks that are different from, or greater than, the risks we face doing comparable business in the United States. These include, among others, risk relating to:        •    Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;        •    Less flexible employee relationships, which may limit our ability to prohibit employees from competing with us after their employment, and may make it more difficult and expensive to terminate their employment;        •    Political and economic instability (including acts of terrorism and outbreaks of war);        •    Coordinating our communications and logistics across geographic distances and multiple time zones, including during times of crisis management;        •    Maintaining awareness of and complying with a wide variety of labor practices and foreign laws, including those relating to export and import duties, environmental policies and privacy issues, as well as laws and regulations applicable to U.S. business operations abroad, including rules relating to trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, the European Union and the United Nations, and the requirements of FCPA as well as other anti-bribery and corruption rules and requirements in the countries in which we operate, as well as unexpected changes in such regulatory requirements and laws;        •    Adverse trade policies, and adverse changes to any of the policies of either the United States or any of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;        •    Adverse changes in tax rates or discriminatory or confiscatory taxation in foreign jurisdictions;        •    Legal or political constraints on our ability to maintain or increase prices;        •    Cash balances held in foreign banks and institutions where governments have not specifically enacted formal guarantee programs; and        •    Governmental restrictions on the transfer of funds to us from our operations outside the United States.  Some of our foreign subsidiaries receive revenues or incur obligations in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we have used foreign currency hedging strategies in the past and currently have some in place, such risks cannot be eliminated entirely, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.  We also operate in certain countries where the risk of political and economic uncertainty is relatively greater than that present in the United States and more stable countries. Adverse geopolitical or economic conditions may temporarily or permanently disrupt our operations in these countries. For example, we use third-party service providers located in India for certain back-office services. To date, the dispute between India and Pakistan involving the Kashmir region, incidents of terrorism in India and general geopolitical uncertainties have not adversely affected our operations in India. However, such factors could potentially affect our operations or ability to use third-party providers in the future. Should our access to these services be disrupted, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We face a variety of risks in our risk management operations that are distinct from those we face in our brokerage operations.  Our risk management operations face a variety of risks distinct from those faced by our brokerage operations, including:        •    The risk that the favorable trend among insureds toward outsourcing various types of claims administration and risk management services will reverse or slow, causing our revenues or revenue growth to decline;        •    The risk that contracting terms will become less favorable or that the margins on our services will decrease due to increased competition, regulatory constraints or other developments;        •    The risk that we will not be able to satisfy regulatory requirements related to third party administrators or that regulatory developments will impose additional burdens, costs or business restrictions that make our business less profitable;        •    The risk that continued economic weakness or a slow-down in economic activity could lead to a continued reduction in the number of claims we process; and        •    The risk that if we do not control our labor and technology costs, we may be unable to remain competitive in the marketplace and profitably fulfill our existing contracts (other than those that provide cost-plus or other margin protection).    10    Table of Contents If any of these developments occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We are subject to regulation worldwide. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if regulations change in a way that adversely affects our operations, we may not be able to conduct our business or may be less profitable.  Many of our activities are subject to regulatory supervision, including insurance industry regulation, Federal and state employment regulation, and regulations promulgated by regulatory bodies in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, including the Financial Services Authority (which we refer to as the FSA) in the U.K. Failure to comply with some of these regulations could lead to litigation and/or disciplinary actions that may include compensating clients for loss, the imposition of penalties and the revocation of our authorization to operate. In addition, changes in legislation or regulations and actions by regulators, including changes in administration and enforcement policies, could from time to time require operational changes that could result in lost revenues or higher costs or hinder our ability to operate our business. For example, although our inability to accept contingent commissions under an agreement with the Attorney General of the State of Illinois and the Director of Insurance of the State of Illinois ended on October 1, 2009, compensation practices such as contingent commissions could in the future return to the scrutiny of the public, State Attorneys General, and state insurance departments, which could lead to regulations prohibiting or placing restrictions upon the practice. If this or other changes in regulation or enforcement occur, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  During March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (together, the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation) were signed into law. The 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation, among other things, increases the level of regulatory complexity for companies that offer health and welfare benefits to their employees. Many clients of our brokerage segment purchase health and welfare products for their employees and, therefore, are impacted by the 2010 Health Care Reform Legislation. If we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from this law and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in our employee benefits consulting business, will be negatively impacted. In addition, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer sponsored health care in response to this law, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.  We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.  We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include claims for damages based on allegations that our employees or sub-agents improperly failed to procure coverage, report claims on behalf of clients, provide insurance companies with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. We have established provisions against these potential matters which we believe to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time based on current material developments. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future, our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or we experience an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. We have purchased errors and omissions insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as current developments warrant.  As more fully described in Note 17 to our 2010 consolidated financial statements, we are subject to a number of legal proceedings, regulatory actions and other contingencies. An adverse outcome in connection with one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition in any given quarterly or annual period. In addition, regardless of any eventual monetary costs, these matters could expose us to negative publicity, reputational damage, harm to our client or employee relationships, or diversion of personnel and management resources, which could adversely affect our financial results.  Contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies are less predictable than standard commissions, and any decrease in the amount of these kinds of commissions we receive could adversely affect our results of operations.  A portion of our revenues consists of contingent and supplemental commissions we receive from insurance companies. Contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability, volume and/or growth of the business placed with such companies during the prior year. Supplemental commissions are commissions paid by insurance companies that are established annually in advance based on historical performance criteria. If, due to the current economic environment or for any other reason, we are unable to meet insurance companies’ profitability, volume and/or growth thresholds, and/or insurance companies increase their estimate of loss reserves, over which we have no control, actual contingent commissions and/or supplemental commissions we receive could be less than anticipated, which could adversely affect our results of operations.    11    Table of Contents Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.  We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including our senior management, brokers and other key personnel. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of members of our senior management team. The insurance brokerage industry has experienced intense competition for the services of leading brokers, and we have lost key brokers to competitors in the past. The loss of our chief executive officer or any of our other senior managers, brokers or other key personnel, or our inability to identify, recruit and retain such personnel, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce our profitability.  The cost of current employees’ medical and other benefits, as well as pension retirement benefits and postretirement medical benefits under our legacy defined benefit plans, substantially affects our profitability. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets or decreases in the interest rates used to discount the pension plans’ liabilities could cause an increase in pension plan costs in future years. Although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, we can make no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce our profitability.  We have developed production operations with the ability to produce refined coal that we believe qualifies for tax credits under IRC Section 45. However, there are significant uncertainties surrounding our investment in these operations, and if we are not successful in claiming IRC Section 45 tax credits, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.  IRC Section 45 provides a tax credit for the production and sale of refined coal from production operations that are placed into service on or before December 31, 2011. We own 42% of Chem-Mod, LLC, which has developed technologies referred to as The Chem-Mod™ Solution that reduce harmful emissions from coal-fired power plants. We intend to use The Chem-Mod™ Solution to produce refined coal at eight production operations placed into service prior to December 31, 2009. We believe that the production and sale of this refined coal qualifies for IRC Section 45 tax credits. We incurred $31.4 million of capital expenditures in 2009 to complete the construction of these operations. We sold portions of our ownership stake in six of these operations, which reduced our net investment in the operations to $22.3 million.  There are significant uncertainties related to our IRC Section 45 investments that must be favorably resolved in order for us to recoup our investment and generate additional earnings from these operations. These include, but are not limited to:        •    Long-term permits must still be obtained. To date, one of the operations has received a permanent regulatory operating permit. The remaining seven operations are not currently operating. In order to obtain long-term permits, the utilities need to show not only reductions in nitrogen oxides and mercury emissions, as IRC Section 45 requires, but also reductions in sulfur, carbon monoxide and particulate emissions while at the same time maintaining all other emissions limits and performance standards required under their air permits. If for any reason the operations are unable to satisfy the regulatory permitting requirements and the utilities are unable to timely obtain long-term permits, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.        •    All conditions under IRC Section 45 must be satisfied. Our ability to claim tax credits under IRC Section 45 depends upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions specified in IRC Section 45. While we have received some confirmation from the IRS relating to our ability to claim these tax credits, we may ultimately be determined not to have satisfied such conditions if, among other things, our conclusions with respect to one or more of the following are incorrect: the accuracy of the emissions reduction analyses upon which we have relied and continue to rely, that The Chem-Mod™ Solution represents qualifying technologies under the rules, that the operations applied the technologies correctly such that at least one of the operations’ owners (we or one of our partners) qualifies as a “producer” of refined coal, or that our operations were placed into service by December 31, 2009. Additionally, IRC Section 45 contains phase-out provisions based upon the market price of coal. As a result, if the price of coal rises to specified levels, we could lose some or all of the future tax credits we expect to receive from these investments.        •    Additional regulatory uncertainties. In the future, utilities may become subject to other regulations that render The Chem-Mod™ Solution obsolete or unusable. Congress may modify or repeal IRC Section 45 so that these tax credits may no longer be available or the law may be interpreted to exclude The Chem-Mod™ Solution. In addition, current environmental laws and regulations limiting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants could be significantly weakened, reducing demand for technologies like The Chem-Mod™ Solution, or could be strengthened beyond the capabilities of The Chem-Mod™ Solution to comply. If any of these regulatory developments occur, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.    12    Table of Contents     •    Utilities’ use of coal may decline. Increasing concerns about greenhouse gases and other air emissions, toxic materials in wastewater discharges and the potential hazardous nature of coal combustion waste, whether as a result of concerns about global climate change or otherwise, could lead to Federal or state regulations that encourage or require utilities to burn less coal, or eliminate its use entirely, in the production of electricity. In addition, while the utilities at which the operations are located have traditionally burned coal to generate electricity, some are also engineered to burn other fuels such as natural gas and oil. Thus, if the price of natural gas and/or oil is low enough relative to the price of coal, utilities may choose to burn natural gas or oil instead of coal to produce electricity. Demand for coal, generally, may also decline as a result of an economic slowdown and a corresponding decline in the use of electricity. If, for any reason, utilities burn less or eliminate coal in the production of electricity, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.        •    Operational risks. The operations’ ability to produce refined coal meeting the requirements of IRC Section 45 may be affected by operational issues. Chem-Mod’s coal-cleaning technologies require proprietary chemical inputs that may not be readily available in the marketplace or available only at prohibitively high costs. The power plants at which the operations are located could be idled for reasons outside our control, including, among other things, operational or environmental problems at the plants, labor strikes, force majeure events such as hurricanes, or terrorist attacks, any of which could halt or impede production at the operations. Other operational risks include the availability and cost of coal (including freight cost), the possibility that the refined coal the operations produce may cause operational problems in the utilities’ boilers, the risk that equipment may not be properly maintained, the risk that the operations might be unable to operate at their rated capacity, and the possibility that the operations could be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key personnel needed for efficient production. If the operations encounter any operational problems, including the types described above, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.        •    Business risks. We have finalized arrangements with two co-investors, and are working to finalize arrangements with other potential co-investors, for the purchase of equity stakes in one or more of the operations. If no satisfactory arrangements can be reached with these potential co-investors, or if in the future any one of our co-investors leaves a project, we could have difficulty finding replacements in a timely manner. We are exposed to credit risk with our co-investors and operational partners, any of which could encounter economic difficulties and become unable to fulfill payment obligations. We could also be exposed to risk due to our lack of control over the operations if future developments, for example a regulatory change affecting public and private companies differently, caused our interests and those of our co-investors to diverge. Finally, our partners involved in the operation and management of the operations could fail to run the operations in a manner that complies with the requirements of IRC Section 45. If any of these developments occur, we may not be able to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.        •    Intellectual property risks. Other companies with technologies similar to The Chem-Mod™ Solution may make claims of intellectual property infringement against Chem-Mod or against us and our partners. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could require that Chem-Mod or we and our partners obtain a license to use the intellectual property. Chem-Mod or we and our partners may be unable to obtain licenses from these third parties on favorable terms, if at all. If Chem-Mod or we and our partners cannot defend such claims or obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms, we may be precluded from using The Chem-Mod™ Solution and may be unable to recoup our investment or generate additional earnings from these operations.  Our IRC Section 45 operations and the by-products from such operations may result in environmental and product liability claims and environmental compliance costs.  The construction and operation of the IRC Section 45 operations are subject to Federal, state and local laws, regulations and potential liabilities arising under or relating to the protection or preservation of the environment, natural resources and human health and safety. Such laws and regulations generally require the operations and/or the utilities at which the operations are located to obtain and comply with various environmental registrations, licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Such laws and regulations also impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of a party’s conduct, on certain entities that are considered to have contributed to, or are otherwise involved in, the release or threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment. Such hazardous substances could be released as a result of burning refined coal produced using The Chem-Mod™ Solution in a number of ways, including air emissions, waste water, and by-products such as fly ash. One party may, under certain circumstances, be required to bear more than its share or the entire share of investigation and cleanup costs at a site if payments or participation cannot be obtained from other responsible parties. By using The Chem Mod™ Solution at locations owned and operated by others, we and our partners may be exposed to the risk of becoming liable for environmental damage we may have had little, if any, involvement in creating. Such risk remains even after production ceases at an operation to the extent the environmental damage can be traced to the types of chemicals or compounds used or operations conducted in connection with The Chem-Mod™ Solution. For example, we and our partners could face the risk of product and environmental liability claims related to concrete incorporating fly ash produced using The Chem-Mod™ Solution. No assurances can be given that contractual arrangements and precautions taken to ensure assumption of these risks by facility owners or operators will result in that facility owner or operator accepting full responsibility for any environmental damage. It is also not uncommon for private claims by    13    Table of Contents  third parties alleging contamination to also include claims for personal injury, property damage, diminution of property or similar claims. Furthermore, many environmental, health and safety laws authorize citizen suits, permitting third parties to make claims for violations of laws or permits and force compliance. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risk and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of an environmental claim. If significant uninsured losses arise from environmental damage or product liability claims, or if the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We have historically benefited from Section 29 tax credits and that law expired on December 31, 2007. The disallowance of IRC Section 29 tax credits would likely cause a material loss.  The law permitting us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits related to our synthetic coal operations expired on December 31, 2007. We believe our claim for IRC Section 29 tax credits in 2007 and prior years is in accordance with IRC Section 29 and four private letter rulings previously obtained by IRC Section 29-related partnerships in which we had an interest. We understand these private letter rulings are consistent with those issued to other taxpayers and have received no indication from the IRS that it will seek to revoke or modify them. However, while our synthetic coal operations are not currently under audit, the IRS could place those operations under audit and an adverse outcome may cause a material loss or cause us to be subject to liability under indemnification obligations related to prior sales of partnership interests in partnerships claiming IRC Section 29 tax credits. For additional information about the potential negative effects of adverse tax audits and related indemnification contingencies, see the discussion on IRC Section 29 tax credits included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”.  Improper disclosure of personal data could result in legal liability or harm our reputation.  One of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients’ confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and other benefit plan participants. We maintain policies, procedures and technological safeguards designed to protect the security and privacy of this information. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information. Such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.  Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. Our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or damage our reputation.  The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business.  The agreements governing our debt contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to dispose of assets, incur additional debt, prepay other debt or amend other debt instruments, pay dividends, engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions or similar transactions, create liens on assets, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, change our business or make investments.  The restrictions in the agreements governing our debt may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and our stockholders and may make it difficult for us to execute our business strategy successfully or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional or more restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to pay dividends. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.  Economic, financial and industry conditions beyond our control may affect our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our debt. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under an agreement that would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under such agreements to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.  We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as GAAP). These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, investments, income taxes, stock-based compensation, claims handling obligations, retirement plans, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, changes in accounting standards could increase costs to the organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.    14    Table of Contents If we are unable to apply technology effectively in driving value for our clients through technology-based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools, our client relationships, growth strategy and operating results could be adversely affected.  Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost-effective basis, and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace. Additionally, the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost-effective technologies, we could experience a material adverse effect on our client relationships, growth strategy and operating results.  Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected, even in the short-term, by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption caused by restricted physical site access, terrorist activities, disease pandemics, or outages to electrical, communications or other services used by our company, our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business. Although we have certain disaster recovery procedures in place and insurance to protect against such contingencies, such procedures may not be effective and any insurance or recovery procedures may not continue to be available at reasonable prices and may not address all such losses or compensate us for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that we are unable to provide services. Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other significant disruption to business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  We are exposed to various risks relating to losses on investments held by our corporate segment.  Our corporate segment holds a variety of investments. These investments are subject to risk of loss due to a variety of causes, including general overall economic conditions, the effects of changes in interest rates, various regulatory issues, credit risk, potential litigation, tax audits and disputes, failure to monetize in an effective and/or cost-efficient manner and poor operating results. Any of these consequences may diminish the value of our invested assets and adversely affect our net worth and profitability.  In the event we issue common stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership.  We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. Should we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages in our company.  Volatility of the price of our common stock could adversely affect our stockholders.  The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:        •    Quarterly variations in our operating results;        •    Seasonality of our business cycle;        •    Changes in the market’s expectations about our operating results;        •    Our operating results failing to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;        •    Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the financial services industry in general;        •    Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;        •    News reports relating to trends in our markets;        •    Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;        •    Material announcements by us or our competitors;        •    Sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and        •    General economic and political conditions such as recessions, economic downturns and acts of war or terrorism.    15    Table of Contents Item 1B.
