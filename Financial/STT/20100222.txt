ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  This Form 10-K contains statements (including statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included under Item 7) that are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of U.S. securities laws, including statements about industry trends, management’s future expectations and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts, are based on assumptions by management, and are often identified by such forward-looking terminology as “expect,” “look,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “seek,” “may,” “will,” “trend,” “target” and “goal,” or similar statements or variations of such terms. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about our confidence in our strategies and our expectations about our financial performance, market growth, acquisitions and divestitures, new technologies, services and opportunities and earnings.    5    Table of Contents Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which change over time, are based on management’s expectations and assumptions at the time the statements are made, and are not guarantees of future results. Management’s expectations and assumptions, and the continued validity of the forward-looking statements, are subject to change due to a broad range of factors affecting the national and global economies, the equity, debt, currency and other financial markets, as well as factors specific to State Street and its subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. Factors that could cause changes in the expectations or assumptions on which forward-looking statements are based include, but are not limited to:        •    financial market disruptions and the economic recession, whether in the U.S. or internationally, and monetary and other governmental actions, including regulation, taxes and fees, designed to address or otherwise be responsive to such disruptions and recession, including actions taken in the U.S. and internationally to address the financial and economic disruptions that began in 2007;        •    increases in the volatility of, or declines in the levels of, our net interest revenue, changes in the composition of the assets on our consolidated balance sheet and the possibility that we may be required to change the manner in which we fund those assets;        •    the financial strength and continuing viability of the counterparties with which we or our customers do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposure;        •    the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities, and the liquidity requirements of our customers;        •    the credit quality, credit agency ratings, and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of the respective securities and the recognition in our consolidated statement of income of an impairment loss;        •    the maintenance of credit agency ratings for our debt and depository obligations as well as the level of credibility of credit agency ratings;        •    the ability to complete our announced and pending acquisitions, as well as future acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures, including the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required, and the ability to satisfy other closing conditions;        •    the risks that acquired businesses will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated, that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected disynergies will be experienced, that customer and deposit retention goals will not be met, that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced and that disruptions from the transaction will harm relationships with customers, employees or regulators;        •    the possibility of our customers incurring substantial losses in investment pools where we act as agent, and the possibility of further general reductions in the valuation of assets;        •    our ability to attract deposits and other low-cost, short-term funding;        •    potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to the effects of consolidation, and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty;        •    the level and volatility of interest rates and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally;        •    our ability to measure the fair value of the investment securities on our consolidated balance sheet;        •    the results of litigation, government investigations and similar disputes or proceedings;        •    the enactment of new legislation and changes in government regulation and enforcement which affect us or our customers, and which may increase our costs and expose us to risk related to compliance;        •    adverse publicity or other reputational harm;    6    Table of Contents       •    the performance and demand for the products and services we offer, including the level and timing of withdrawals from our collective investment products;        •    our ability to grow revenue, attract and/or retain and compensate highly skilled people, control expenses and attract the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements;        •    our ability to control operating risks, information technology systems risks and outsourcing risks and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business and the possibility that our controls will fail or be circumvented;        •    the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk;        •    changes in accounting standards and practices; and        •    changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that impact the amount of taxes due.  Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in our forward-looking statements and from our historical financial results due to the factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K or disclosed in our other SEC filings. Forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the time this Form 10-K is filed with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to revise the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K to reflect events after the time it is filed with the SEC. The factors discussed above are not intended to be a complete summary of all risks and uncertainties that may affect our businesses. We cannot anticipate all potential economic, operational and financial developments that may adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  Forward-looking statements should not be viewed as predictions, and should not be the primary basis upon which investors evaluate State Street. Any investor in State Street should consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in particular our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, or registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov or on our website at www.statestreet.com.  The following is a discussion of risk factors applicable to State Street.  Disruptions in the global financial markets that began in mid-2007 have increased the uncertainty and unpredictability we face in managing our businesses, and continued or additional disruptions could have an adverse effect on our businesses, our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  Since mid-2007, global credit and other financial markets have suffered from substantial volatility, illiquidity and disruption. These factors resulted in the bankruptcy or acquisition of, or significant government assistance to, a number of major domestic and international financial institutions, some of which were significant counterparties with us. These events, and the potential for continuing disruptions, have affected overall confidence in the financial markets and in financial institutions, have further exacerbated liquidity and pricing issues within the fixed-income markets, have increased the uncertainty and unpredictability we face in managing our business and have had an adverse effect on our businesses, our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The continuation of current disruptions or the occurrence of additional disruptions in the global markets could have an adverse effect on our businesses and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  Market disruptions could continue to adversely impact our fee revenue as the value of assets under custody, administration or management would decline, while the costs of providing the related services would remain constant due to the fixed nature of such costs. These factors could reduce our asset-based fee revenue and could adversely affect our other transaction-based revenue, such as securities finance and foreign exchange revenue, and the volume of transactions that we execute for our customers, but the costs of providing the related services would not similarly decline. Further, the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect our foreign    7    Table of Contents  exchange trading revenue. In general, increased currency volatility may increase our market risk, and our foreign exchange revenue, all other things being equal, is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility. In addition, as our business grows globally, our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our levels of consolidated revenue, expense and results of operations, as well as the value of our investment in our non-U.S. operations.  The overall worldwide economic recession has adversely affected, and is likely to continue to adversely affect, our businesses and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  Our businesses are affected by global economic conditions, including regional and international rates of economic growth and the impact that such economic conditions have on the financial markets. The downturn in the global economies, as well as the U.S. economy, that began in mid-2007 has led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, a lack of consumer confidence, decreased market valuations and liquidity, increased market volatility and a widespread reduction of business activity generally. The resulting economic pressure and lack of confidence in the financial markets has adversely affected our businesses and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition, as well as the business of our customers. A worsening of economic conditions in the U.S. or globally would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult conditions on us and on the financial services industry in general.  The failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties, many of whom are financial institutions, and our assumption of significant credit and counterparty risk, could expose us to loss.  The financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions, including banks, broker/dealers, collective investment funds and insurance companies. As a result of these interconnections, we and many of our customers have concentrated counterparty exposure to other financial institutions. Although we have procedures for monitoring both individual and aggregate counterparty risk, like other large financial institutions, the nature of our business is such that large individual and aggregate counterparty exposure is inherent in our business as our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses. At any point in time, having one or more counterparties to which our exposure exceeds 10% of our total shareholders’ equity, exclusive of unrealized gains or losses, is not unusual.  Concentration of counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our customers because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties (or in some cases of our customers’ counterparties) has the potential to expose us to risk of loss.  The current instability of the financial markets has resulted in many financial institutions becoming significantly less creditworthy, and as a result we are exposed to increased counterparty risks, both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our customers. Changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly, is often based upon a variety of factors and is difficult to predict. In addition, as U.S. and non-U.S. governments have addressed the financial crisis in an evolving manner, the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain. If a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us, we could incur financial losses that materially adversely affect our businesses and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  The degree of customer demand for short-term credit also tends to increase during periods of market turbulence, exposing us to further counterparty-related risks. For example, investors in collective investment vehicles for which we act as custodian may engage in significant redemption activity due to adverse market or economic news that was not anticipated by the fund’s manager. Our relationship with our customers, the nature of the settlement process and our systems result in the extension of short-term credit in such circumstances. For some types of customers, we provide credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios, which increases our potential loss if the customer experiences credit difficulties. From time to time, we may assume concentrated credit risk at the individual obligor, counterparty or guarantor level. In addition, we may from time to time be exposed to concentrated credit risk at the industry or country level, potentially exposing us to a single market or political event or a correlated set of events. We are also generally not able to net exposures across counterparties    8    Table of Contents  that are affiliated entities and may not be able in all circumstances to net exposures across multiple products to the same legal entity. As a consequence, we may incur a loss in relation to one entity or product even though our exposure to one of its affiliates or across product types is over-collateralized. Moreover, not all of our counterparty exposure is secured, and when our exposure is secured, the realizable market value of the collateral may have declined by the time we exercise rights against that collateral. This risk may be particularly acute if we are required to sell the collateral into an illiquid or temporarily impaired market.  In addition, our customers often purchase securities or other financial instruments from a financial counterparty, including broker/dealers, under repurchase arrangements, frequently as a method of reinvesting the cash collateral they receive from lending their securities. Under these arrangements, the counterparty is obligated to repurchase these securities or financial instruments from the customer at the same price at some point in the future. The anticipated value of the collateral is intended to exceed the counterparty’s repayment obligation. In many cases, we agree to indemnify our customers from any loss that would arise upon a default by the counterparty if the proceeds from the disposition of the securities or other financial assets are less than the amount of the repayment obligation by the customer’s counterparty. In those instances, we, rather than our customer, are exposed to the risks associated with counterparty default and collateral value.  Some of the assets on our consolidated balance sheet are entitled to the benefit of guarantees from monoline insurance companies. Several of these insurance companies have experienced significant deterioration in their financial condition. To the extent that assets require credit support from the guarantors to be able to pay principal and interest in full and the guarantor does not or is not able to make payments required under the guarantee, we are exposed to risk of loss.  Although our overall business is subject to these interconnections, several of our lines of business are particularly sensitive to them, including our Global Treasury operations, currency and other trading, securities lending and investment management. Given the limited number of strong counterparties in the current market, we are not able to mitigate all of our and our customers’ counterparty credit risk. The current consolidation of financial service firms that began in 2008, and which we believe is likely to continue in 2010, and the failures of other financial institutions, have increased the concentration of our counterparty risk.  We may incur losses, which could be material to our financial results in the periods incurred, arising from bankruptcy-related claims by and against Lehman entities in the United States and the U.K.  We have claims against Lehman entities in bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. and the U.K. We also have amounts that we owe to Lehman entities. These claims and amounts owed arise from the resolution of transactions that existed at the time the Lehman entities entered bankruptcy, including foreign exchange transactions, securities lending arrangements and repurchase agreements. In the aggregate, the amounts that we believe we owe Lehman entities, as reflected in our submissions in the bankruptcy proceedings, are less than our estimate of the realizable value of the claims we have asserted against Lehman entities. However, we may recognize gains and losses in different fiscal periods depending in part on the timing and sequence of the resolution of the claims by us and against us in the different proceedings. In addition, the process for resolving these claims and obligations is complex and may continue for some time. We do not know whether the bankruptcy courts and administrators will accept or challenge our claims; question positions we have taken as to our contractual rights and obligations; question any of the valuations or other calculations that we have used in preparing such claims; or seek amounts from us greater than that which we believe to be due.  For example, in connection with the resolution of our obligations pursuant to the repurchase agreements between our customers in the U.S. and a Lehman entity, we indemnified our customers against loss and assumed our customers’ rights with respect to collateral consisting of interests in commercial real estate loans. For purposes of our claim in the bankruptcy court, we valued this collateral at our estimate of its liquidation value following the Lehman bankruptcy; however, when we took possession of this collateral and recorded it in our consolidated balance sheet, we valued the collateral based upon our estimate of its fair value in accordance with GAAP, which fair value was significantly greater than its liquidation value. This difference in valuation, among other factors, could result in the bankruptcy court assigning a lesser value to our claim or rejecting our claim entirely. Similarly,    9    Table of Contents  certain of our customers had entered into securities lending arrangements and/or repurchase agreements with Lehman’s U.K. affiliate. In accordance with the terms of our lending program and repurchase agreement product, we have indemnified those customers against loss in connection with the resolution of these arrangements, and sold or taken possession of the related collateral, which included asset-backed securities. For purposes of the resolution of securities lending arrangements and repurchase agreements in the U.K. in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings, we valued asset-backed securities at their assumed liquidation values, in each case reflecting the absence of an active trading market for these securities following the bankruptcy of Lehman. We subsequently recorded these assets in our consolidated balance sheet at a significantly greater value, based upon relevant market conditions and our assessment of their fair value in accordance with GAAP at that time. As a result of these valuation decisions, we determined that there was a shortfall in collateral supporting repurchase agreements and applied excess collateral supporting Lehman’s obligations under securities lending arrangements against Lehman’s obligations under the repurchase agreements. The administrator in the U.K. bankruptcy proceedings may challenge any or all of the positions that we have taken, including our valuation of the collateral and the application of excess collateral supporting Lehman’s obligations under the securities lending arrangements against Lehman’s unsecured obligations under the repurchase agreements. Given the uncertainty in the process and the potential for a court or administrator to challenge the amounts that we believe to be owed by us or due to us, it is possible that our obligations, net of recoveries, to Lehman entities may be substantial, with the result that our net payment obligations could be potentially as much as several hundred million dollars.  If all or a significant portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio on our consolidated balance sheet were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings and our capital ratios would be adversely affected.  During 2008 and 2009, rating agencies imposed an increasing number of downgrades and credit watches on the securities in our investment securities portfolio, which contributed to the decline in fair values. Any continued increase in downgrades and credit watches may contribute to a further decline in the fair values of these securities. Further, the measurement of the fair value of these securities, as well as our other financial assets, involves significant judgment due to the complexity of the factors contributing to the measurement. Market volatility makes measurement of the fair value of our investment portfolio even more difficult and subjective. More generally, as market conditions continue to be volatile we cannot provide assurance that the amount of the unrealized losses will not increase.  To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in these portfolios is determined to be other than temporary, and the loss is related to credit factors, we will recognize a charge to our earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made and our capital ratios could be adversely affected. If any such charge is significant, a rating agency might downgrade our credit rating or put us on credit watch. Even if we do not determine that the unrealized losses associated with these portfolios require an impairment charge, increases in these unrealized losses adversely affect our tangible common equity ratio, which may adversely affect credit rating agency and investor sentiment toward us. This negative perception also may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets or might increase our cost of capital.  Further information with respect to unrealized losses on the securities in our investment portfolio is provided in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, and information with respect to the financial assets and liabilities which we carry at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included under Item 7, and in note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included under Item 8.  We may need to raise additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms, and which may make future business acquisitions or dispositions difficult.  As a result of continued disruption in the global financial markets or other developments having an adverse effect on our capital ratios, we may need to raise additional capital in order to maintain our credit ratings or for    10    Table of Contents  other purposes. However, our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, will depend on a number of factors, including the state of the financial markets. Accordingly, we cannot be sure of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us.  Additionally, our ability to make acquisitions in order to achieve greater economies of scale or to expand our product offerings is dependent upon our financial resources and our ability to access the capital markets. In addition, our ability to dispose of businesses that no longer fit our business model may be difficult if attractive financing or capital is not available to prospective buyers. Due to company-specific issues or a lack of liquidity in the capital markets, our ability to expand through acquisitions or to dispose of businesses that no longer are strategic to us may be adversely affected.  Our business activities expose us to liquidity and interest-rate risk.  In our business activities, we assume liquidity and interest-rate risk in our investment portfolio of longer-and intermediate-term assets, which is funded in large part by our customer deposit base. Similarly, as a result of the May 2009 consolidation of the asset-backed commercial paper conduits that we administer, we fund the portfolio of intermediate term assets held by the conduits through our customer deposit base, through the conduits’ issuance of commercial paper or through draw-downs of other short-term sources of liquidity. In addition, we may be exposed to liquidity or other risks in managing asset pools for third parties that are funded on a short-term basis, or where the customers participating in these products have a right to the return of cash or assets on limited notice. These business activities include, among others, securities finance collateral pools, money market and other short-term investment funds and liquidity facilities utilized in connection with municipal bond programs.  Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our customers incur substantial losses in investment pools where we act as agent.  Our management of collective investment pools on behalf of customers exposes us to reputational risk and, in some cases, operational losses. The incurrence by our customers of substantial losses in these pools, particularly in money market funds (where there is a general market expectation that net asset value will not drop below $1.00 per share), in situations where we make distributions in-kind to satisfy redemption requests or in circumstances where one of our investment strategies significantly underperforms the market or our competitors’ products, could result in significant harm to our reputation and significantly and adversely affect the prospects of our associated business units. In some very limited circumstances, and consistent with applicable regulatory requirements, we may compensate investment pools for all or a portion of the pool’s losses even though we are not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so. Because we often implement investment and operational decisions and actions over multiple investment pools to achieve scale, we face the risk that losses, even small losses, may have a significant effect in the aggregate. While it is currently not our intention, any decision by us to provide financial support to our investment pools would potentially result in the recognition of significant losses and could in certain situations require us to consolidate the investment pools onto our consolidated balance sheet. A failure or inability to provide such support could damage our reputation among current and prospective customers. Any termination by a third-party guarantor of its guarantee could, if we were unable to replace the guarantee, adversely affect our business or result in litigation.  Our businesses may be adversely affected by litigation.  From time to time, our customers, or the government on their behalf, may make claims and take legal action relating to our performance of fiduciary or contractual responsibilities. We may also face employment lawsuits or other legal claims. In any such claims or actions, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us and may result in financial liability or an adverse effect on our reputation among investors or on customer demand for our products and services. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies. As a result, any reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgments may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.    11    Table of Contents In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement, the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible.  In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal actions and regulatory matters, we cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any pending matter or, if determined adversely to us, the costs associated with any such matter, particularly where the claimant seeks very large or indeterminate damages or where the matter presents novel legal theories, involves a large number of parties or is at a preliminary stage. The resolution of certain pending legal actions or regulatory matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the quarter in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established.  Further information with respect to the foregoing and our other ongoing litigation matters is provided in Legal Proceedings included under Item 3.  We may incur losses, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the period incurred, with respect to sub-custody and prime broker arrangements we had with Lehman entities.  Various Lehman entities that served as sub-custodian or prime broker for some of our customers or funds entered insolvency proceedings in September 2008. Estimating the actual amount or timing of any recovery on our customers’ and funds’ claims against any of these Lehman entities is currently not possible. When these insolvency proceedings were commenced, cash and securities attributable to our custody customers, having approximately $325 million in net asset value at September 15, 2008, was held by or through Lehman entities. While the appointment of these Lehman entities had been made at our customer’s direction and we believe that we carried out our responsibilities with respect to our customers, our custody customers may nevertheless seek to recover from us any losses they incur as a result of the Lehman insolvency proceedings.  In the case of common trust funds managed by us, in our capacity as manager and trustee, we had appointed Lehman as prime broker for four of these funds, which at September 15, 2008 (the date two of the Lehman entities involved entered insolvency proceedings) had cash and securities with net asset values of approximately $312 million held by or though Lehman entities. The investors in these funds have commenced or threatened litigation against us, and in one case have obtained a judgment against us. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these proceedings, and an adverse resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the fiscal period or periods in which resolved. See Legal Proceedings included under Item 3.  We face litigation and potential additional governmental inquiries in connection with our provision of foreign exchange services to custody customers.  In October 2009, the Attorney General of the State of California commenced an action against State Street Bank under the California False Claims Act and California Business and Professional Code relating to foreign exchange services State Street Bank provides to California state pension plans. The California Attorney General asserts that the pricing of certain foreign exchange transactions for these pension plans was not consistent with the terms of the applicable custody contracts and related disclosures to the plans, and that, as a result, State Street Bank made false claims and engaged in unfair competition. The Attorney General asserts actual damages of $56 million for periods from 2001 to 2007 and seeks additional penalties, including treble damages. We provide custody and foreign exchange services to government pension plans in other jurisdictions and attorney generals from a number of these other jurisdictions, as well as the U.S. Attorney General’s office, have requested information in connection with informal inquiries into our foreign exchange pricing. If additional governmental proceedings of this nature were to be commenced, such actions could have a material impact on our reputation and on our future revenues. While no other customers have commenced legal proceedings, the services we offer to the State of California are also offered to a broad range of custody clients in the U.S. and internationally. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of the pending proceeding in California or other proceedings that might be commenced against us by any other Attorneys General or customers, and the resolution of any such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated results of operations. In light of the    12    Table of Contents  action commenced by the California Attorney General, we are providing customers with greater transparency into the pricing of this product and other alternatives offered by us for addressing their foreign exchange requirements. Although we believe such disclosures will address customer interests for increased transparency, over time such action may result in pressure on our pricing of this product or result in clients electing other foreign exchange execution options, which would have an adverse impact on the revenue from, and profitability of, this product for us.  We may be exposed to customer claims, financial loss, reputational damage and regulatory scrutiny as a result of transacting purchases and redemptions relating to the unregistered cash collateral pools underlying our securities lending program at a net asset value of $1.00 per unit rather than a lower net asset value based upon market value of the underlying portfolios.  A portion of the cash collateral received by customers under our securities lending program is invested in cash collateral pools that we manage. Interests in these cash collateral pools are held by unaffiliated customers and by registered and unregistered investment funds that we manage. Our cash collateral pools that are money market funds registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 are required to maintain, and have maintained, a constant net asset value of $1.00 per unit. The remainder of our cash collateral pools are collective investment funds that are not required to be registered under the Investment Company Act. These unregistered cash collateral pools seek, but are not required, to maintain, and transact purchases and redemptions at, a constant net asset value of $1.00 per unit.  Our securities lending operations consist of two components; a direct lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, the collateral pools for which we refer to as direct lending collateral pools; and investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives that are managed by SSgA and engage in securities lending, which we refer to as SSgA lending funds. The following table shows the aggregate net asset values of the unregistered direct lending collateral pools and the aggregate net asset value of the unregistered collateral pools underlying the SSgA lending funds, in each case based on a constant net asset value of $1.00 per unit.                 (in billions)   December 31, 2009   December 31, 2008   December 31, 2007(1)   Direct lending collateral pools   $ 85   $ 85   $ 150   Collateral pools underlying SSgA lending funds     24     31     44     (1)  Certain of the SSgA lending funds were participants in the direct lending collateral pools until October 2008. The direct lending collateral pool balances at December 31, 2007 related to SSgA lending funds have been included within the SSgA lending fund balances and excluded from the direct lending collateral pool balances presented above.    13    Table of Contents We may incur losses, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the period incurred, as a result of continuing to transact based upon a consistent $1.00 per unit net asset value.  Both the direct lending collateral pools and the collateral pools underlying the SSgA lending funds have continued to transact purchases and redemptions at a constant net asset value of $1.00 per unit even though the market value of the unregistered cash collateral pools’ portfolio holdings, determined using pricing from third-party pricing sources, has been below $1.00 per unit. This difference between the transaction value used for purchase and redemption activity and the market value of the collateral pool’s assets arose, depending upon the collateral pool, at various points since the commencement of the financial crisis in mid-2007 and has persisted throughout 2008 and 2009. The following table sets forth the range of net asset values per unit and weighted-average net asset values per unit based upon the market value of our unregistered cash collateral pools underlying the direct lending program and SSgA lending funds as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.                        December 31, 2009   December 31, 2008   December 31, 2007     Range   WeightedAverage   Range   WeightedAverage   Range   WeightedAverage   Direct lending collateral pools   $0.93 to$1.00   $0.986   $0.92 to$1.00   $0.941   $0.99 to$1.00   $0.993   Collateral pools underlying SSgA lending funds   $0.97 to$0.99   $0.981   $0.91 to$0.95   $0.932   $0.99 to$1.00   $0.991 We believe that our practice of continuing to effect purchases and redemptions at $1.00 per unit in the unregistered cash collateral pools, notwithstanding that the underlying portfolios have a market value of less than $1.00 per unit, is in compliance with the terms of our unregistered cash collateral pools and in the best interests of participants in the direct lending program and the SSgA lending funds. We have continued this practice for a number of reasons, including the fact that none of the securities in the cash collateral pools is currently in default or considered to be materially impaired, and that there are restrictions on withdrawals from the collective investment funds. Although the market value of the assets in the collateral pools has improved during 2009, a portion of these assets are floating rate instruments with several years of remaining maturity; consequently, the rate of valuation improvement is likely to slow in 2010 or the market value may decline again as a result of changes in market sentiment or in the credit quality of such instruments. However, as described below, if we continue to transact purchases and redemptions from the unregistered cash collateral pools based upon a constant net asset value of $1.00 per unit and the liquid assets of these pools turn out to be insufficient to support redemption activity at such value, or the pools suffer material credit losses on their underlying portfolio holdings, investors in the direct lending program and/or the SSgA lending funds may seek to hold us responsible for any shortfall due to prior redemptions at a value above the market value of the underlying portfolio or as a result of any such portfolio defaults.  We may incur losses, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the period incurred, as a result of our imposition of restrictions on redemptions from, and our management of, the direct lending program.  Beginning in October 2008, following the increased market disruption resulting from the bankruptcy of Lehman, we began to require, and continue to require, that direct participants in the collateral pools who wish to redeem their interests in the pools, other than in connection with the ordinary course operation of the securities lending program, to accept redemption proceeds in the form of in-kind distributions. While the redemption restrictions were imposed to protect the interest of all participants in the direct lending program (which include ERISA plans, governmental retirement plans, mutual funds and other institutional asset owners), the prolonged imposition of these restrictions could materially and adversely affect the relationship with our lending customers and the financial results of our direct lending operation. Despite these redemption restrictions, one significant participant in the direct lending program redeemed a substantial portion of its interest in the collateral pools in a manner that we determined not to be consistent with the ordinary course of operations of the securities lending program. After attempts to resolve the dispute with the redeeming participant and have them restore short-term liquidity to the collateral pool, we took action, as trustee, that in effect resulted in an in-kind redemption of the participant’s remaining interest in the collateral pool in a manner that caused such in-kind redemption and the    14    Table of Contents  prior cash redemptions, taken as a whole, to be completed on substantially the same basis as if the participant had initially requested an in-kind redemption of its entire interest in the collateral pool. The redeeming participant has commenced a legal action against us for damages that it alleges it incurred as a result of this redemption. An adverse judgment in such case could have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which such judgment is issued. In addition to the actions relating to the redeeming participant, we are in discussions with a limited number of securities lending customers in the U.K. who have questioned whether our management of their participation in our securities lending program was consistent with the obligations owed by us to them. At this time, we do not know if we will enter into a settlement with respect to such claims or if the amount of any settlement would be less than or greater than the reserve established.  We may incur losses which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the period incurred, as a result of our valuation of units of the SSgA lending funds and our imposition of restrictions on redemptions.  A broad range of SSgA lending funds participate in our securities lending program and as a result hold interests in certain of the unregistered cash collateral pools. The lending funds continue to purchase and redeem units of the lending funds at prices that assign a value of $1.00 to units of the collateral pools held by such funds. If it was determined that the historical or prospective transaction valuation for purchase or redemption of units of the lending funds should reflect a value of the units of the collateral pools of less than $1.00, lending fund investors may claim that they overpaid for their investment, or that investors who redeemed their units at prices that reflect a valuation of units of the collateral pools of $1.00 were overcompensated, and seek to hold us responsible for their alleged investment loss. For financial reporting purposes, the lending funds’ financial statements for the periods ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 reflected or will reflect net asset values for the lending funds based upon a valuation of the units of the collateral pools at market value rather than at the $1.00 transaction value. If we continue to transact purchases and redemptions of units of the lending funds based upon the $1.00 transaction value of the collateral pools rather than their financial statement reported value, such potential exposure would likely increase over time. Since the percentage of a lending fund’s assets on loan varies based on the fund’s investment focus and with changes in market demand, the potential impact of this issue on the net asset value of the lending fund will vary significantly, and in some cases may be material.  In an effort to provide investors in the SSgA lending funds equal access to liquidity in the collateral pools and limit the need to sell portfolio securities into an illiquid market in order to meet redemption requests, in March 2009, we established restrictions on the percentage of an investor’s interest in a lending fund that may be redeemed in any month. These restrictions superseded limitations on redemption other than in kind or that were to an extent consistent with the customers’ ordinary course of their participation in the lending funds. The restrictions on redemptions currently do not apply to participant level activity in defined contribution plans. Investors in the lending funds have objected to, and may claim to have been harmed by, such limitations on liquidity of their investment, notwithstanding our right to implement such restrictions under the governing documents for such funds. As a result, participants in our lending funds may seek to be compensated for any loss they incurred or allege to have incurred resulting from either the valuation of the units of the lending funds or restrictions on the liquidity of such units.  We may incur losses, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the period incurred, as a result of claims by investors in the direct lending program and SSgA lending funds and an inquiry by the SEC.  The SEC is conducting an informal inquiry into the management of our securities lending program and disclosures made to direct lending participants and participants in the SSgA lending funds, in particular as to the adequacy of our disclosures regarding the collateral pools during periods when those pools had a market value of less than $1.00. While we are cooperating with such inquiry, we cannot determine whether the staff of the SEC will conclude that our disclosures or conduct of the program form the basis of a potential formal proceeding seeking damages or other remedies. In addition to the action with the redeeming participant in the direct lending program referred to above, participants in certain of the lending funds have commenced putative class actions on behalf of all investors in the lending funds that are benefit plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income    15    Table of Contents  Security Act. The class actions allege, among other things, failure to exercise prudence in the management of the collateral pools and breach of the governing instruments in connection with our imposition of restrictions on redemptions and seek both damages and injunctive relief. A determination by the SEC or any other regulatory authority to commence an enforcement proceeding with regard to our securities lending operations or SSgA lending funds, or an adverse outcome in the class action or any future proceedings, could have a material adverse impact upon our securities lending operations or the operations of SSgA or upon our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  If we are unable to continuously attract deposits and other short-term funding, our consolidated financial condition, including our capital ratios, our consolidated results of operations and our business prospects could be harmed.  Liquidity management is critical to the management of our consolidated balance sheet and to our ability to service our customer base. We generally use our sources of funds to:        •    extend credit to our customers in connection with our custody business;        •    meet demands for return of funds on deposit by customers; and        •    manage the pool of intermediate- and longer-term assets that are included in the investment securities on our consolidated balance sheet.  Because the demand for credit by our customers is difficult to forecast and control, and may be at its peak at times of disruption in the securities markets, and because the average maturity of our investment portfolio is significantly longer than the contractual maturity of our deposit base, we need to continuously attract, and are dependent upon, access to various sources of short-term funding.  In managing our liquidity, our primary source of short-term funding is customer deposits, which are predominantly transaction-based deposits by institutional investors. Our ability to continue to attract these deposits, and other short-term funding sources such as certificates of deposit and commercial paper, is subject to variability based upon a number of factors, including volume and volatility in the global securities markets, the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities and the perception of safety of those deposits or short-term obligations relative to alternative short-term investments available to our customers, including in the capital markets. For example, the contraction in the number of counterparties for which we have a favorable credit assessment as a result of ongoing market disruptions has made it difficult to invest our available liquidity, which has adversely affected the rate of return that we earned on these assets, which could harm our ability to attract customer deposits.  The availability and cost of credit in short-term markets is highly dependent upon the markets’ perception of our liquidity and creditworthiness. Our efforts to monitor and manage our liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other event-driven reductions in liquidity. In such events, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing our net interest revenue, or we may need to dispose of a portion of our investment portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in the realization of a loss in our consolidated statement of income.  Any downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could adversely affect our borrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity and cause reputational harm.  Various independent rating agencies publish credit ratings for our debt obligations based on their evaluation of a number of factors, some of which relate to our performance and other corporate developments, including financings, acquisitions and joint ventures, and some of which relate to general industry conditions. We anticipate that the rating agencies will review our ratings regularly based on our consolidated results of operations and developments in our businesses. Our credit rating was downgraded by each of the principal rating agencies during the first quarter of 2009. A further downgrade or a significant reduction in our capital ratios might adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets or might increase our cost of capital. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to maintain our current ratings. The current market environment and our    16    Table of Contents  exposure to other financial institution counterparties increases the risk that we may not maintain our current ratings. Downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. A failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating may also preclude us from being competitive in certain products, may be negatively perceived by our customers or counterparties or may have other adverse reputational effects.  Additionally, our counterparties, as well as our customers, rely upon our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. If we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, including due to market or regulatory developments, our announced or rumored business developments or consolidated results of operations, a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating, our counterparties may become less willing to enter into transactions, secured or unsecured, with us, our customers may reduce or place limits upon the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers and our prospective customers may select other service providers. The risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is increased in the current market environment, where the consolidation of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, is resulting in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors. If our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our customers, on our or our customers’ behalf, will be materially compromised. If our customers reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide them, our net interest revenues will decrease accordingly.  Our businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm.  Our relationship with many of our customers is predicated upon our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. Adverse publicity, regulatory actions, litigation, operational failures, the failure to meet customer expectations and other issues with respect to one or more of our businesses could materially and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain customers or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses. Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the marketplaces in which we operate, the regulatory environment and customer expectations. If any of these developments has a material effect on our reputation, our business will suffer.  The illiquidity and volatility of global fixed-income and equity markets has affected our ability to effectively and profitably manage assets on behalf of customers and may make our products less attractive to customers.  We manage assets on behalf of customers in several forms, including in collective investment pools, including money market funds, securities finance collateral pools, cash collateral and other cash products and short-term investment funds. In addition to the impact on the market value of customer portfolios, the illiquidity and volatility of both the global fixed-income and equity markets have negatively affected our ability to manage customer inflows and outflows from our pooled investment vehicles. Within our asset management business, we manage investment pools, such as mutual funds and collective investment funds that generally offer our customers the ability to withdraw their investments on short notice, generally daily or monthly. This feature requires that we manage those pools in a manner that takes into account both maximizing the long-term return on the investment pool and retaining sufficient liquidity to meet reasonably anticipated liquidity requirements of our customers.  During the market disruption that accelerated following the bankruptcy of Lehman, the liquidity in many asset classes, particularly short- and long-term fixed-income securities, has declined dramatically, and providing liquidity to meet all customer demands in these investment pools without adversely affecting the return to non-withdrawing customers has become more difficult. For customers that invest directly or indirectly in certain of the collateral pools and seek to terminate participation in lending programs, we have required, in accordance with the applicable customer arrangements, that these withdrawals from the collateral pools take the form of partial in-kind distributions of securities, and in the case of SSgA funds that engage in securities lending, we have implemented limitations on the portion of an investor’s interest in such fund that may be withdrawn during    17    Table of Contents  any month, although such limitations do not apply to participant directed activity in defined contribution plans. If higher than normal demands for liquidity from our customers were to return post-Lehman-bankruptcy levels or increase, it could become more difficult to manage the liquidity requirements of our collective investment pools and, as a result, we may elect to support the liquidity of these pools. If liquidity in the fixed-income markets were to deteriorate further or remain disrupted for a prolonged period, our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to consolidate the investment pools, levels of redemption activity could increase and our consolidated results of operations and business prospects could be adversely affected.  In addition, if a money market fund that we manage were to have unexpected liquidity demands from investors in the fund that exceeded available liquidity, the fund could be required to sell assets to meet those redemption requirements, and it may then be difficult to sell the assets held by the fund at a reasonable price, if at all.  Alternatively, although we have no such obligations or arrangements currently in place, we have in the past, and may in the future, guarantee liquidity to investors desiring to make withdrawals from a fund, and a significant amount of such guarantees could adversely affect our own liquidity and consolidated financial condition. Because of the size of the investment pools that we manage, we may not have the financial ability or regulatory authority to support the liquidity demands of our customers. The extreme volatility in the equity markets has led to potential for the return on passive and quantitative products deviating from their target return. The temporary closures of securities exchanges in certain markets create a risk that customer redemptions in pooled investment vehicles may result in significant tracking error and underperformance relative to stated benchmarks. Any failure of the pools to meet redemption requests or to underperform relative to similar products offered by our competitors could harm our business and our reputation.  For further information regarding risks related to our investment pools, please refer to the risk factor titled “Our reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our customers incur substantial losses in investment pools where we act as agent” on page 11.  Acquisitions, strategic alliances and divestiture pose risks for our business.  As part of our business strategy, we acquire complementary businesses and technologies, enter into strategic alliances and divest portions of our business. During 2009, we announced definitive agreements to acquire the global custody, depository banking, correspondent banking and fund administration business of Intesa Sanpaolo, or Intesa, and the acquisition of Mourant International Finance Administration, or MIFA, for cash. We undertake transactions such as these to, among other reasons, expand our geographic footprint, access new customers, technologies or services, develop closer relationships with our business partners, efficiently deploy capital or to leverage cost savings or other financial opportunities. We may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of capital and diminished competitive position or reputation.  These transactions also involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, regulatory, managerial and operational challenges, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. For example, the businesses that we acquire or our strategic alliances may underperform relative to the price paid or the resources committed by us, or we may not achieve anticipated cost savings or otherwise be adversely affected by acquisition-related charges. Further, past acquisitions have resulted, and upon closing transactions such as the purchase of Intesa and MIFA will result, in the recording of goodwill and other significant intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. We may be required to record impairment in our consolidated statement of income in future periods if we do not realize the value of these assets. Through our acquisitions we may also assume unknown or undisclosed liabilities, fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies. While in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, adequate due diligence and indemnification provisions, we cannot be certain that the indemnification provisions and other risk mitigants we put in place will be sufficient.    18    Table of Contents Various regulatory approvals or consents are generally required prior to closing or acquisitions and, which may include approvals of the Federal Reserve and other domestic and foreign regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition or require changes to its terms that materially affect the terms of the transaction or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the transaction. Any such conditions, or any associated regulatory delays, could limit the benefits of the transaction. Some acquisitions we announce may not be completed, if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals or if other closing conditions are not satisfied.  The integration of our acquisitions results in risks to our business and other uncertainties.  The integration of acquisitions presents risks that differ from the risks associated with our ongoing operations. Integration activities are complicated and time consuming. We may not be able to effectively assimilate services, technologies, key personnel or businesses of acquired companies into our business or service offerings, as anticipated, alliances may not be successful, and we may not achieve related revenue growth or cost savings. We also face the risk of being unable to retain the customer bases of acquired companies or unable to cross-sell our products and services to an acquired business’s customers. Acquisitions of investment servicing businesses entail information technology systems conversions, which involve operational risks and may result in customer dissatisfaction and defection. Customers of asset servicing businesses that we have acquired may be competitors of our non-custody businesses. The loss of some of these customers or a significant reduction in revenues generated from them, for competitive or other reasons, could adversely affect the benefits that we expect to achieve from these acquisitions. With any acquisition, the integration of the operations and resources of the businesses could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our and the acquired company’s ongoing businesses, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources.  We are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.  The markets in which we operate across all facets of our business are both highly competitive and global. We have experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience, pricing pressure in many of our core businesses. Many of our businesses compete with other domestic and international banks and financial services companies, such as custody banks, investment advisors, broker-dealers, outsourcing companies and data processing companies. Ongoing consolidation within the financial services industry could pose challenges in the markets we serve, including potentially increased downward pricing pressure across our businesses. Many of our competitors, including our competitors in core services, have substantially greater capital resources than we do. In some of our businesses, we are service providers to significant competitors. These competitors are in some instances significant customers, and the retention of these customers involves additional risks, such as the avoidance of actual or perceived conflicts of interest and the maintenance of high levels of service quality. The ability of a competitor to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. Many of our core services are subject to contracts that have relatively short terms or may be terminated by our customer after a short notice period. In addition, pricing pressures as a result of the activities of competitors, customer pricing reviews, and rebids, as well as the introduction of new products, may result in a reduction in the prices we can charge for our products and services.  If we fail to attract new customers and cross-sell additional products and services to our existing customers, our prospects for growth may be harmed.  Our strategy for growth depends upon both attracting new customers and cross-selling additional products and services to our existing customer base. To the extent that we are not able to achieve these goals, we may not be able to meet our financial goals. In addition, our proactive cross-selling of multiple products and services to our customers can exacerbate the negative financial effects associated with the risk of loss of any one customer.    19    Table of Contents Development of new products and services may impose additional costs on us and may expose us to increased operational risk.  Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses. The introduction of new products and services can entail significant time and resources. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including technical and control requirements that may need to be developed and implemented, rapid technological change in the industry, our ability to access technical and other information from our customers and the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our customers. Failure to manage successfully these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, as well as on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  It may be difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.  We may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology effectively, which may allow competitors to duplicate our technology and products and may adversely affect our ability to compete with them. To the extent that we are not able to protect our intellectual property effectively through patents or other means, employees with knowledge of our intellectual property may leave and seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others’ advantage. In addition, we may infringe upon claims of third-party patents, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. The intellectual property of an acquired business may be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for such a business. However, such acquisitions are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property that we believe we are acquiring, that the intellectual property is dependent upon licenses from third parties, that the acquired business infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others, or that the technology does not have the acceptance in the marketplace that we anticipated.  Our revenues and profits are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  Our financial performance could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates as they affect our asset and liability management activities. The levels of interest rates in global markets, changes in the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates, the direction and speed of interest-rate changes, and the asset and liability spreads relative to the currency and geographic mix of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, affect our net interest revenue. Our ability to anticipate these changes or to hedge the related exposures on and off our consolidated balance sheet can significantly influence the success of our asset and liability management activities and the resulting level of our net interest revenue. The impact of changes in interest rates will depend on the relative durations of assets and liabilities in accordance with their relevant currencies. In general, sustained lower interest rates, a flat or inverted yield curve and narrow interest-rate spreads have a constraining effect on our net interest revenue.  Competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.  Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and/or retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of uncertainty concerning evolving compensation restrictions applicable, or which may become applicable, to banks (and potentially not applicable to other financial services firms). The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, their knowledge of our markets, their years of industry experience and, in some cases, the    20    Table of Contents  difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Similarly, the loss of key employees, either individually or as a group, can adversely affect our customers’ perception of our ability to continue to manage certain types of investment management mandates.  Long-term contracts expose us to pricing and performance risk.  We enter into long-term contracts to provide middle office or investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing services, primarily for conversions, to customers, including services related but not limited to certain trading activities, cash reporting, settlement and reconciliation activities, collateral management and information technology development. These arrangements generally set forth our fee schedule for the term of the contract and, absent a change in service requirements, do not permit us to re-price the contract for changes in our costs or for market pricing. The long-term contracts for these relationships require, in some cases, considerable up-front investment by us, including technology and conversion costs, and carry the risk that pricing for the products and services we provide might not prove adequate to generate expected operating margins over the term of the contracts. Profitability of these contracts is largely a function of our ability to accurately calculate pricing for our services, efficiently assume our contractual responsibilities in a timely manner and our ability to control our costs and maintain the relationship with the customer for an adequate period of time to recover our up-front investment. Our estimate of the profitability of these arrangements can be adversely affected by declines in the assets under the customers’ management, whether due to general declines in the securities markets or customer specific issues. In addition, the profitability of these arrangements may be based on our ability to cross sell additional services to these customers, and we may be unable to do so.  In addition, performance risk exists in each contract, given our dependence on successful conversion and implementation onto our own operating platforms of the service activities provided. Our failure to meet specified service levels may also adversely affect our revenue from such arrangements, or permit early termination of the contracts by the customer. If the demand for these types of services were to decline, we could see our revenue decline.  Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate, and operational risk could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.  We may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, operational risk, interest-rate risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. We have adopted various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk. While we currently believe that our risk management process is effective, we cannot provide assurance that those controls, procedures, policies and systems will always be adequate to identify and manage the risks in our various businesses. In addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets and fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets or our businesses or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory mandates or expectations.  Operational risk is inherent in all of our business activities. As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, we provide a broad array of services, including research, investment management, trading services and investment servicing, that give rise to operational risk. In addition, these services generate a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements. We face the risk that the policies, procedures and systems we have established to comply with our operational requirements will fail, be inadequate or become outdated. We also face the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, employee supervisory or monitoring mechanisms or other systems or controls, which could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations. Operational errors that result in us remitting funds to a failing or    21    Table of Contents  bankrupt entity may be irreversible, and may subject us to losses. We may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. In addition, our customers, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect us, or the customers, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected. When we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies related to operational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any reserves we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the periods in which we recognize the losses.  We depend on information technology, and any failures of our information technology systems could result in significant costs and reputational damage.  Our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure to record and process a large volume of increasingly complex transactions, in many currencies, on a daily basis, across numerous and diverse markets. Any interruptions, delays or breakdowns of this infrastructure could result in significant costs to us and damage to our reputation.  Cost shifting to foreign jurisdictions may expose us to increased operational risk and reputational harm and may not result in expected cost savings.  We actively strive to achieve cost savings by shifting certain business processes to lower-cost geographic locations, including by forming joint ventures and by establishing operations in lower cost areas, such as Poland, India and China, and outsourcing to vendors in various jurisdictions. This effort exposes us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control or effective management within these business operations. The increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk. During periods of transition, greater operational risk and customer concern exist regarding the continuity of a high level of service delivery. The extent and pace at which we are able to move functions to lower-cost locations may also be impacted by regulatory and customer acceptance issues. Such relocation of functions also entails costs, such as technology and real estate expenses, that may offset or exceed the expected financial benefits of the lower-cost locations.  Any theft, loss or other misappropriation of the confidential information we possess could have an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory actions, litigation and other adverse effects.  Our businesses and relationships with customers are dependent upon our ability to maintain the confidentiality of our and our customers’ trade secrets and confidential information (including customer transactional data and personal data about our employees, our customers and our customers’ customers). Unauthorized access to such information may occur, resulting in theft, loss or other misappropriation. Any theft, loss or other misappropriation of confidential information could have a material adverse impact on our competitive positions, our relationships with our customers and our reputation and could subject us to regulatory inquiries and enforcement, civil litigation and possible financial liability or costs.  We face extensive and changing government regulation, which may increase our costs and expose us to risks related to compliance.  Most of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies, and many of the customers to which we provide services are themselves subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. As a financial institution with substantial international operations, we are subject to extensive regulatory and supervisory oversight, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in connection with our global operations. The regulations affect, among other things, the scope of our activities and customer services, our capital structure and our ability to fund the operations of our subsidiaries, our lending practices, our dividend policy and the manner in which we market our services. The    22    Table of Contents  disruption of the financial markets in 2008 and 2009 and resulting governmental support of, and loss of confidence in, financial institutions has resulted in demand for increased and more extensive regulation of our business both in the U.S. and internationally. Congress is currently considering legislation that may have a significant impact on the regulatory structure for the financial markets, special taxes on financial institutions and increased deposit assessments by the FDIC, and proposals by the White House have included the potential separation of proprietary trading and the management of hedge and other alternative asset funds from banking institutions or restrictions on the flexibility of financial institutions with respect to the compensation of their employees. The proposals currently being considered by Congress, depending upon their final form, could affect our business positively or adversely or may result in substantial additional costs. Different countries may respond to the market and economic environment in different and potentially conflicting manner, which could have the impact of increasing the cost of compliance for us. New or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry. Evolving regulations, such as the Basel and other global regulatory capital frameworks, short-selling regulations and anti-money laundering regulations may impose significant compliance costs on us. The regulatory perspective, particularly that of the Federal Reserve Board, on regulatory capital requirements may affect our ability to make acquisitions, declare dividends or repurchase common stock unless we can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of our regulators, that such actions would not adversely affect our regulatory capital position in the event of a severely stressed market environment. In addition, the implementation of certain of the proposals with regard to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect our regulatory capital position relative to that of our competitors.  If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations. Similarly, many of our customers are subject to significant regulatory requirements, and retain our services in order for us to assist them in complying with those legal requirements. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide, as well as our costs. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers. If we cause customers to fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, we may be liable to them for losses and expenses that they incur. In recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations. If this regulatory trend continues, it could adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations.  Changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  New accounting standards, or changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards, by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the SEC, can potentially affect our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. These changes are difficult to predict, and can materially affect how we record and report our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and other financial information. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, and, in some cases, the restatement of consolidated prior period financial statements.  Changes in tax laws or regulations, and challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions, may adversely affect our net income, our effective tax rate and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.  Our businesses can be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation, the expiration of existing tax laws, or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide. U.S. tax laws that have favorably affected the taxation of certain of our overseas operations expired at the end of 2009, and it is uncertain when and whether they will be re-enacted. In addition, recent federal government budget submissions include proposals that would have a material adverse effect on the taxation of our overseas operations.    23    Table of Contents In the normal course of business, we are subject to reviews by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities. These reviews may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxes due and the allocation of taxable income among tax jurisdictions. These adjustments could affect the attainment of our financial goals.  The quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors that result in imprecise risk assessments, inaccurate valuations or poor business decisions.  We use quantitative models to help manage many different aspects of our businesses. As an input to our overall assessment of capital adequacy, we use models to measure the amount of credit risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk and business risk we face. During the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we sometimes use models to measure the value of positions for which reliable market prices are not available. We also use models to support many different types of business decisions including trading activities, hedging, asset and liability management and whether to change business strategy. In all of these uses, errors in the underlying model could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences. Because of our widespread usage of models, potential errors in models pose an ongoing risk to us.  Additionally, we may fail to accurately quantify the magnitude of the risks we face. Our measurement methodologies rely upon many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations we rely on may not continue to be relevant. Consequently, the measurements that we make for regulatory and economic capital may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect those changes. While our risk measures may indicate sufficient capitalization, we may in fact have inadequate capital to conduct our businesses.  We face significant risks developing and implementing our future business plans and strategies.  In order to maintain and grow our business, we must continuously make strategic decisions about our future business plans, including plans for entering or exiting business lines or geographic markets, plans for acquiring or disposing of businesses and plans to build new systems and other infrastructure. Our business, our consolidated results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by incorrect business and strategic decisions or improper implementation of our decisions. If the business decisions that we make prove erroneous, we may fail to be responsive to industry changes or customer demands. Moreover, the implementation of our decisions may involve significant capital outlays, often far in advance of when we expect to derive any related revenues, and therefore it may be difficult to alter or abandon plans without incurring significant loss.
