ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business faces significant risks, including credit, market/liquidity, operational, legal/regulatory and strategic/reputation risks. The factors described below may not be the only risks we face and are not intended to serve as a comprehensive listing or be applicable only to the category of risk under which they are disclosed. The risks described below are generally applicable to more than one of the following categories of risks. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could suffer. Credit Risks If our clients fail to perform under their loans, our business, profitability and financial condition could be adversely affected. As a lender, one of the largest risks we face is the possibility that a significant number of our smaller client borrowers, or a smaller number of our larger client borrowers, will fail to pay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause large losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. We have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. While this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment. We cannot assure you that our allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to absorb future loan losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. Because of the credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs can be volatile. We may need to make material provisions for loan losses in any period, which could reduce net income or increase net losses in that period. Our loan portfolio has a credit profile different from that of most other banking companies. Many of our loans are made to companies in the early stages of development with negative cash flows and no  15    established record of profitable operations. In many cases, repayment of the loan is dependent upon receipt of additional equity financing from venture capitalists or others. Collateral for many of our loans often includes intellectual property, which is difficult to value and may not be readily salable in the case of default. Because of the intense competition and rapid technological change that characterizes the companies in our technology and life sciences industry sectors, a borrower’s financial position can deteriorate rapidly. Additionally, we are increasing our lending to larger corporate technology clients, including some companies with greater levels of debt relative to their equity, and have increased the average size of our loans over time. These changes could affect the risk of borrower default and increase the impact on us of any single borrower default. For all of these reasons, our level of nonperforming loans, loan charge-offs and additional allowance for loan losses can be volatile and can vary materially from period to period. Increases in our level of nonperforming loans may require us to increase our provision for loan losses in any period, which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that period. Market/Liquidity Risks Our current level of interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest spread could have a material impact on our business, profitability and financial condition. A major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on amounts used to fund interest-earning assets and the interest rates and fees we receive on those assets. We fund interest-earning assets using non-interest bearing deposits, interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. Our interest-earning assets include loans extended to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, such as inflation, recession, global economic disruptions, unemployment and the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. In the aggregate, our deposits are less sensitive to interest rate increases than our loans. As a result, recent increases in market interest rates have caused our interest rate spread to increase. However, if interest rates decline, it likely will cause our interest rate spread to decline. In addition to general changes in the level of interest rates, increases in the interest rates we pay on amounts used to fund interest-earning assets or decreases in the interest rates we receive on our interest-earning assets could affect our interest rate spread. For example, in 2006 we funded our loan growth primarily through short-term borrowings. These funds carry meaningfully higher interest rate costs than our current deposit base. If we significantly increase the amount of our interest-earning assets that we fund through borrowings rather than deposits, our interest rate spread will likely decline. Similarly, if we significantly increase the amount of our interest-earning assets that we fund through interest-bearing deposits, or increase the rates we pay on those deposits, our interest rate spread likely would decline. Interest rates paid by us could be affected by competitive, legislative or other developments. For example, Congress has for many years debated repealing a law that prohibits banks from paying interest rates on checking accounts. If this law were to be repealed, we would be subject to competitive pressure to pay interest on our clients’ checking accounts, which would negatively affect our interest rate spread. The interest rates we receive on our interest-earning assets could be affected by a variety of factors, including market interest rates as noted above, competition, a change over time in the mix of loans comprising our loan portfolio and the mix of loans and investment securities on our balance sheet. Additionally, a portion of our loan fee income, a component of loan interest income, is predicated on the receipt of warrant assets. If we fail to continue to receive warrant assets, our future interest rate spread may decline. Our business is dependent upon access to funds on attractive terms. Consequently, a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, profitability and financial condition. We derive our net interest income through lending or investing capital on terms that provide returns in excess of our costs for obtaining that capital. As a result, our credit ratings are important to our  16    business. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs or increase the interest rates we pay on deposits. Further, our credit ratings and the terms upon which we have access to capital may be influenced by circumstances beyond our control, such as overall trends in the general market environment, perceptions about our creditworthiness or market conditions in the industries in which we focus. Warrant, private equity fund and direct equity investment portfolio gains or losses depend upon the performance of the portfolio investments and the general condition of the public equity markets, which are uncertain and may vary materially by period. We historically have obtained rights to acquire stock, in the form of equity warrants, in certain clients as part of negotiated credit facilities and for other services. We also have made investments in private equity funds as well as direct equity investments in companies. The timing and amount of income, if any, from the disposition of client warrants, securities obtained through the exercise of warrants, private equity funds and direct equity investments, as well as the fair market value of these rights and investments, typically depend upon factors beyond our control, including the performance of the underlying portfolio companies, investor demand for initial public offerings (“IPOs”), fluctuations in the market prices of the underlying common stock of these companies, levels of merger and acquisition activity and legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell securities and investments. In future periods, we may not be able to continue to obtain equity warrants to the same extent we historically have achieved, we may not realize gains from the exercise of warrants, the gains realized upon the sale of the securities obtained through the exercise of warrants and the gains realized upon the sale of our fund or direct equity investments may be materially less than the current fair value of such assets reflected in our financial statements, or the fair market value of some or all of these assets could decline. Each of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. All of these factors are difficult to predict. Due to the nature of investing and holding warrants in private equity venture-backed technology and life science companies, it is likely that investments within our portfolio will become impaired. However, we are not in a position to know at the present time which specific investments, if any, are likely to become impaired or the extent or timing of individual impairments. Therefore, we cannot predict future investment gains or losses with any degree of accuracy, and any gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to period. Public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions involving our clients can cause loans to be paid off early, which could adversely affect our business and profitability. While an active market for public equity offerings and mergers and acquisitions generally has positive implications for our business, one negative consequence is that our clients may pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering, are acquired by or merge with another entity or otherwise receive a significant equity investment. Any significant reduction in our outstanding loans could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. Operational Risks If we fail to retain our key employees or recruit new employees, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. We rely on a substantial number of employees who have technical expertise in their subject matter area and a strong network of relationships with individuals and institutions in the markets we serve. If we were to have less success in recruiting and retaining these employees than our competitors, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. We believe that our employees frequently have opportunities for alternative employment with other organizations, including competing financial institutions and our clients. 17     Changes to our employee compensation structure could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to attract, recruit and retain certain key employees. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (“APB No. 25”) and requires us to record compensation expense for all employee share-based payments. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006. This expense has had and likely will continue to have a material impact on our results of operations going forward. In May 2006, in an effort to align our option grant rate to that of other financial institutions similar to us, we committed to restrict the total number of shares of our common stock issued under stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock bonus awards and any other equity awards granted during a fiscal year as a percentage of the total number of shares outstanding on a prospective basis. We may in the future consider taking other actions to modify employee compensation structures, such as granting cash compensation or other forms of equity compensation. Our decision to reduce the number of option shares to be granted on a prospective basis, and any other future changes we may adopt in our employee compensation structures, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows, as well as our ability to attract, recruit and retain certain key employees. We could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services. Fear of security breaches could limit the growth of our online services. We offer various internet-based services to our clients, including online banking services. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintain our clients’ confidence in our online services. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction data. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test our security, failure to mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and could harm our business. People generally are concerned with security and privacy on the Internet and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Our ability to provide financial services over the Internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit confidential information online. As a result, our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Business interruptions due to natural disasters and other events beyond our control can adversely affect our business. Our operations can be subject to natural disasters and other events beyond our control, such as earthquakes, fires, public health issues, power failures, telecommunication loss, terrorist attacks and acts of war. Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our critical business offices are located in California near major earthquake faults. Such events of disaster, whether natural or manmade, could cause severe destruction or interruption to our operations. Financial institutions, such as us, generally must resume operations promptly following any interruption. If we were to suffer a disruption and were not able to resume operations within a period consistent with industry standards, our business could suffer serious harm. In addition, depending on the nature and duration of the interruption, we might be vulnerable to fraud or other losses or to a loss of client confidence. Our business continuity program, which we began implementing during 2005, has not yet been completed. There is no assurance that our business continuity program can adequately mitigate the risks of such business interruptions. We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. Third parties provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as transaction processing, Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in services provided by these third parties, or any  18    failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. We face risks associated with the ability of our information technology systems and our processes to support our operations and future growth effectively. In order to serve our target clients effectively, we have developed a comprehensive array of banking and other products and services. In order to support these products and services, we have developed and purchased information technology and other systems and processes that are relatively more complex and costly than those used by other financial institutions of our size. As our business continues to grow, we will continue to invest in these systems and processes. These investments may affect our future profitability. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively and timely improve our systems and processes to meet our business needs efficiently. A failure of our information technology systems or processes to meet our current business needs, or a failure to improve these systems and processes effectively and in a timely manner to meet our future business needs, could adversely affect our operations, financial condition, results of operations and future growth. We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit, we may assume that a customer’s audited financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We also may rely on the audit report covering those financial statements. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we rely on financial statements or other information that do not comply with GAAP or that are materially misleading. Our accounting policies and methods are key to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. They may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management’s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative. Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements. From time to time, FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. 19    If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our stock price, and could potentially subject us to litigation. Legal/Regulatory Risks We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business. SVB Financial Group, including the Bank, is extensively regulated under federal and state laws governing financial institutions. These regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, other clients of financial institutions and the deposit insurance fund. Federal and state laws and regulations govern, limit or otherwise affect the activities in which we may engage and may affect our ability to expand our business over time. In addition, a change in the applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy could have a material effect on our business, including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products. These laws and regulations also require financial institutions, including SVB Financial and the Bank, to maintain certain minimum levels of capital, which may affect our ability to use our capital for other business purposes. If we were to violate federal or state laws or regulations governing financial institutions, we could be subject to disciplinary action that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Federal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to financial institutions. Other regulatory bodies, including the SEC, the NASD and state securities regulators, regulate broker-dealers, including our subsidiaries SVB Alliant and SVB Securities. Violations of the laws governing financial institutions and broker-dealers could result in the revocation of necessary licenses or authorizations, the imposition of censures, civil money penalties or fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders, and the suspension or expulsion from the securities business of a firm, its officers or employees. Supervisory actions could result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums and limitations on the activities of SVB Financial Group. These supervisory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability and reputation. In addition, increased regulatory requirements, whether due to the adoption of new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations, or more expansive or aggressive interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability. SVB Financial relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue. SVB Financial is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on SVB Financial’s common and preferred stock, should SVB Financial elect to pay dividends, and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to SVB Financial. Also, SVB Financial’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors. 20    Strategic/Reputation Risks Adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions, especially in the technology sector, could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth and profitability. If conditions deteriorate in the domestic or global economy, especially in the technology, life science, private equity and premium wine industry niches, our business, growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected. A global, U.S. or significant regional economic slowdown could harm us by adversely affecting our clients’ and prospective clients’ access to capital to fund their businesses, their ability to sustain and grow their businesses, the level of funds they have available to maintain deposits, their demand for loans, their ability to repay loans and otherwise. Decreases in the amount of equity capital available to start-up and emerging-growth companies could adversely affect our business, growth and profitability. Historically, our strategy has focused on providing banking products and services to emerging-growth companies receiving financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capitalists, “angels,” and corporate investors. We derive a meaningful share of our deposits from these emerging growth companies and provide them with loans as well as other banking products and services. In some cases, our lending credit decision is based on our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital or angel-backed client will receive a second or third round of equity capital from investors. If the amount of capital available to such companies decreases, it is likely that the number of new clients and investor financial support to our existing borrowers could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability and growth prospects. Among the factors that have affected and could in the future affect the amount of capital available to startup and emerging-growth companies are the receptivity of the capital markets IPOs or mergers and acquisitions of companies within our technology and life science industry sectors, the availability and return on alternative investments and general economic conditions in the technology and life science industries. Reduced capital markets valuations could reduce the amount of capital available to startup and emerging-growth companies, including companies within our technology and life science industry sectors. We face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business, growth and profitability. Other banks and specialty and diversified financial services companies, many of which are larger than we are, offer lending, leasing, other financial products and advisory services to our client base. In addition, we compete with hedge funds and private equity funds, which currently have very significant amounts of capital available to invest and lend. In some cases, our competitors focus their marketing on our industry sectors and seek to increase their lending and other financial relationships with technology companies, early stage growth companies or special industries such as wineries. In other cases, our competitors may offer a broader range of financial products to our clients. When new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the pricing and credit terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share. Our pricing and credit terms could deteriorate if we act to meet these competitive challenges, which could adversely affect our business, profitability, financial condition and future growth. Similarly, competitive pressures could adversely affect the business, profitability, financial condition and future growth of our non-banking services, including our access to capital and attractive investment opportunities for our funds business and our ability to secure attractive engagements in our investment banking business. Our ability to maintain or increase our market share depends on our ability to meet the needs of existing and future clients. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and to meet the needs of existing and potential future clients. A failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce, a failure to introduce products that the market may demand,  21    or the costs associated with developing, introducing and providing new products and services could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability and growth prospects. We face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings. If appropriate opportunities present themselves, we may engage in strategic activities, which could include acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, investments or other undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful. In order to finance future strategic undertakings, we might obtain additional equity or debt financing. Such financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If obtained, equity financing could be dilutive and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to execute strategic activities successfully will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary based on the nature of the activity but may include our success in integrating the operations, services, products, personnel and systems of an acquired company into our business, retaining key employees, achieving anticipated synergies and otherwise realizing the undertaking’s anticipated benefits. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic efforts may divert management’s attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny. If we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We face risks associated with international operations. One component of our strategy is to expand internationally. To date, we have opened offices in the United Kingdom, India and China. We plan to expand our operations in those locations and are exploring adding other locations. Our efforts to expand our business internationally carries with it certain risks, including risks arising from the allocation of management time and attention to these efforts and the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in doing business on an international basis, including, among others, legal, regulatory and tax requirements and restrictions, uncertainties regarding liability, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, differing technology standards or customer requirements, political and economic risks and financial risks, including currency and payment risks. These risks could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, we face risks that our non-U.S. based employees may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our business reputation is important and any damage to it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our reputation is very important to sustain our business, as we rely on our relationships with our current, former and potential clients and stockholders, the private equity community and the industries that we serve. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from regulatory, supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, our conduct of our business or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business.
