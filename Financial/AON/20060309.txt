Item 1A. Risk Factors.    The following are risks related to our business and the insurance industry.   Our results may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance industries.   Our results historically have been subject to significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the insurance industry. Changes in premium rates affect not only the potential profitability of our underwriting businesses but also generally affect the commissions and fees payable to our brokerage businesses. In addition, insurance industry developments that can significantly affect our financial performance include factors such as:    •rising levels of actual costs that are not known by companies at the time they price their products;   8          •volatile and unpredictable developments, including weather-related and other natural and man-made catastrophes, including acts of terrorism; •changes in levels of capacity and demand, including reinsurance capacity; •changes in reserves resulting from the general claims and legal environments as different types of claims arise and judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers' liabilities develop; and •changes in business practices and business compensation models.    Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.   Since the Attorney General of New York brought charges against one of our competitors in October 2004, there has been a great deal of uncertainty concerning then-longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Soon after the Attorney General brought those charges, Aon and certain other large insurance brokers announced that they would terminate contingent commission arrangements with underwriters. Most insurance brokers, however, currently continue to enter into such arrangements, regulators have not taken action to end such arrangements throughout the industry and thus it is unclear at this time whether other brokers will continue to accept contingent commissions. Because of this uncertainty, there is no assurance that we will be able to develop a new business compensation model that permits us to compete successfully against brokers who have not terminated contingent commission arrangements, nor can we assure that any new business compensation model we develop will generate revenues equivalent to those previously received from contingent commissions.   We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.   We believe that competition in our lines of business is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength, claims-paying ability ratings and name recognition. In particular, we compete with a large number of national, regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers, brokers and with respect to our extended warranty business, third-party administrators, manufacturers and distributors.   Some of our underwriting competitors have penetrated more markets and offer a more extensive portfolio of products and services and have more competitive pricing than we do, which can adversely affect our ability to compete for business. Some underwriters also have higher claims-paying ability ratings and greater financial resources with which to compete and are subject to less government regulation than our underwriting operations.   We encounter strong competition for both business and professional talent in our insurance brokerage and risk management services operations from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms throughout the world, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants that provide risk-related services and products. Our consulting operations compete with independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world.   In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:    •an increase in capital-raising by insurance underwriting companies, which could result in new entrants to our markets and an influx of capital into the industry; •the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds;   9          •changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory investigations; •the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative markets types of coverage; and •additional regulations promulgated by the Financial Services Authority in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.    New competition as a result of these developments could cause the supply of, and demand for, our products and services to change, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our 2005 restructuring plan.   In third quarter 2005, we announced that we were reviewing the revenue potential and cost structure of each of our businesses. As a result of this review, we have adopted restructuring initiatives that are expected to result in the elimination of approximately 1,800 employee positions, the closing of several offices, asset impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We currently expect that the restructuring plan will result in cumulative pretax charges of $262 million. The objective of the restructuring and other business reorganization initiatives is to improve our profitability through operational efficiency. Our savings net of restructuring expenses is expected to become positive in 2006, with a targeted annualized savings of approximately $180 million by 2008. We cannot assure you that we will achieve the targeted savings.   A decline in the financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact new sales of insurance products.   Financial strength and claims-paying ability ratings have become increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. These ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies for the purpose of rendering an opinion as to an insurance company's financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. They are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors, nor are they recommendations to buy, sell or hold specific securities. Periodically, the rating agencies evaluate our insurance underwriting subsidiaries to confirm that they continue to meet the criteria of the ratings previously assigned to them. A downgrade, or the potential for a downgrade, of these ratings could, among other things, increase the number of policy cancellations, adversely affect relationships with brokers, retailers and other distributors of our products and services, negatively impact new sales and adversely affect our ability to compete.   Virginia Surety Company, Inc., our principal property and casualty insurance company subsidiary, is currently rated "A-" (excellent; fourth highest of 16 rating levels) by A.M. Best Company. Combined Insurance Company of America, the principal insurance subsidiary that underwrites our specialty accident and health insurance business, is currently rated "A" (excellent; third highest of 16 rating levels) by A.M. Best Company, "A-" (strong; third highest of nine rating levels) for financial strength by S&P and "A3" (good; third highest of nine rating levels) for financial strength by Moody's Investors Service. We cannot assure that one or more of the rating agencies will not downgrade or withdraw their financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings in the future.   Changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results.   Our insurance underwriting subsidiaries own a substantial investment portfolio of fixed-maturity and equity and other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2005, our fixed-maturity investments (approximately 98% was investment grade) had a carrying value of $4.2 billion, our equity investments had a carrying value of $40 million and our other long-term investments and limited partnerships had a  10      carrying value of $515 million. Accordingly, changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results.   For example, changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from, and the market value of, fixed-maturity investments. Similarly, general economic conditions, stock market conditions and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our equity investments. We monitor our portfolio for other-than-temporary impairments in carrying value. For securities judged to have an other-than-temporary impairment, we recognize a realized loss through the statement of income to write down the value of those securities.   In 2005, we recognized impairment losses of $11 million. We cannot assure that we will not have to recognize additional impairment losses in the future, which would negatively affect our financial results.   In 2001, our two major insurance companies sold the vast majority of their limited partnership portfolio, valued at $450 million, to Private Equity Partnership Structures I, LLC (PEPS I) a qualifying special purpose entity (QSPE). The common stock interest in PEPS I is held by a limited liability company which is owned by one of our subsidiaries (49%) and by a charitable trust, which is not controlled by us, established for victims of the September 11 attacks (51%). Approximately $171 million of investment grade fixed-maturity securities were sold by PEPS I to unaffiliated third parties. PEPS I then paid our insurance underwriting companies the $171 million in cash and issued to them an additional $279 million in fixed-maturity and preferred stock securities. The fixed-maturity securities our insurance underwriting companies received from PEPS I are rated as investment grade by S&P.   As part of this transaction, Aon is required to purchase from PEPS I additional fixed-maturity securities in an amount equal to the unfunded limited partnership commitments, as they are requested. As of December 31, 2005, these unfunded commitments amounted to $48 million.   Although the PEPS I transaction has reduced the reported earnings volatility historically associated with directly owning limited partnership investments, it will not eliminate our risk of future losses. For instance, we must analyze our preferred stock and fixed-maturity interests in PEPS I for other-than-temporary impairment, based on the valuation of the limited partnership interests held by PEPS I and recognize an impairment loss if necessary. We cannot assure that we will not have to recognize impairment losses with respect to our PEPS I interests in the future.   The FASB has a current project on its agenda that is expected to result in a change to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles with respect to financial asset transfers such as the PEPS I transaction. We cannot assure that the current accounting for our PEPS I investments will be unaffected by these possible changes.   Our net pension liabilities may continue to grow, which could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity and require us to make additional cash contributions to the pension plans.   To the extent that the present value of the benefits incurred to date for pension obligations in the major countries in which we operate continue to exceed the market value of the assets supporting these obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. As a result of the decline in the equity markets over the past several years as well as declines in interest rates, some of our defined benefit pension plans, particularly in the U.K., have suffered significant valuation losses in the assets backing the related pension obligation.   Current projections indicate that our 2006 defined benefit pension expense for our major pension plans will increase by approximately $4 million compared with 2005 and that cash contributions of approximately $186 million will be required in 2006, although we may elect to contribute more. Total cash contributions to these major defined benefit pension plans in 2005 were $463 million, an increase  11       of $274 million over 2004. Future estimates are based on certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates, fair value of assets for some of our plans and expected return on plan assets. We are currently taking actions to manage our pension liabilities, including closing certain plans to new participants. However, changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been announced.   We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.   We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. The litigation naming us as a defendant ordinarily involves our activities as a broker or provider of insurance products or as an employer. It is possible that, if the outcomes of these contingencies and legal proceedings were not favorable to us, it could materially adversely affect our future financial results. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Aon has purchased errors and omissions ("E&O") insurance and other insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, net of insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant.   In 2004, Aon, other insurance brokers, insurers and numerous other industry participants received subpoenas and other requests for information from the office of the Attorney General of the State of New York and from other states relating to certain practices in the insurance industry.   On March 4, 2005, Aon entered into an agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") with the Attorney General of the State of New York, the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, the Illinois Attorney General and the Director of the Division of Insurance, Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (collectively, the "State Agencies") to resolve all the issues related to investigations conducted by the State Agencies.   As has been described in detail in Aon's previous financial filings, the Settlement Agreement requires Aon to pay between 2005-2007 a total of $190 million into a fund (the "Fund") to be distributed to certain Eligible Policyholder clients. The Settlement Agreement sets forth the procedures under which Aon mailed notices to its Eligible Policyholder clients and distributes the Fund to Participating Policyholder clients. In order to obtain a payment from the Fund, Participating Policyholders were required to tender a release of claims against the Company arising from acts, omissions, transactions or conduct that are the subject of the lawsuits.   As required by the Settlement Agreement, within 60 days of the effective date of that agreement, the Company commenced the implementation of certain business reforms, including agreeing not to accept contingent compensation as defined in the Settlement Agreement.   Purported clients have also filed civil litigation against Aon and other companies under a variety of laws and legal theories relating to broker compensation practices and other issues under investigation by New York and other states. As previously reported, a putative class action styled Daniel v. Aon (Affinity) has been pending in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois since August 1999. On March 9, 2005, the Court gave preliminary approval to a nationwide class action settlement within the  12       $40 million reserve established in the fourth quarter of 2004. The Court held hearings in the fourth quarter of 2005 to consider whether to grant final approval to the settlement and is expected to issue a decision in first quarter 2006.   Beginning in June 2004, a number of other putative class actions have been filed against Aon and other companies by purported clients under a variety of legal theories, including state tort, contract, fiduciary duty, antitrust and statutory theories and federal antitrust and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act theories. These actions are currently pending at early stages in state court in California and Illinois and in federal court in New Jersey. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.   Beginning in late October 2004, several putative securities class actions have been filed against Aon in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Also beginning in late October 2004, several putative ERISA class actions were filed against Aon in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.   In May 2005, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Securities and Exchange Commission sent to Aon subpoenas seeking information relevant to these agencies' industry-wide investigations of finite risk insurance. Aon is fully cooperating with these investigations.   In July 2004, several subsidiaries of Aon were joined as defendants in an action in a U.K. court between British Petroleum ("BP") and underwriters who subscribed to policies of insurance covering various offshore energy projects on which BP and its co-venturers have incurred losses. BP settled on confidential terms with underwriters, but asserted a claim against Aon for approximately $96 million, which BP claims is a shortfall between its total losses and what it recovered in the settlements with underwriters, plus interest and costs. The trial in this matter concluded in December 2005, and judgment is expected to be issued sometime in the first half of 2006. Aon believes it has meritorious defenses and has vigorously defended itself against these claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.   In February 2006, Lloyds announced that it had brought suit in London against Benfield and a subsidiary of Aon to recover alleged losses relating to these brokers' placement of insurance for Lloyds's New Central Fund. Lloyds alleges that its brokers did not fairly present the risk to reinsurers and thus that the brokers should be held liable for reinsurers' failure to pay approximately £325 million ($563 million based on the December 31, 2005 exchange rate) in claims. Aon disputes Lloyds's allegations, believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself against Lloyd's claims.   Fiduciary Counselors, Inc., a former Aon subsidiary, has asked Aon Consulting, Inc. of New Jersey to defend and indemnify it with regard to claims that may be asserted in an arbitration relating to the former subsidiary's service from November 1999 to November 2000 as an independent fiduciary for the development and construction of the Diplomat Resort and Country Club in Hollywood and Hallendale, Florida (the "Project"). Aon has conditionally agreed to defend and indemnify Fiduciary Counselors with respect to the potential arbitration demand. The prospective claimants, a labor union pension fund that owns the Project and its current independent fiduciary, allege that Fiduciary Counselors breached fiduciary duties and other obligations under ERISA. The prospective claimants have asserted that their claims are valued at over $100 million. Aon believes that there are meritorious defenses both as to liability and damages and continues to evaluate whether the matter may be resolved without formal arbitration.  13        Although the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us, on the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of Aon. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.   Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.    Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including underwriters, brokers and other professional personnel. Competition for such experienced professional personnel is intense. If we cannot hire and retain talented personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.   We are subject to increasing costs arising from errors and omissions claims against us.    In our insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, we often assist our clients with matters which include the placement of insurance coverage or employee benefit plans and the handling of related claims. Errors and omissions claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Errors and omissions claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub-agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured. It is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, errors and omissions claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.   Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.    Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. With respect to our insurance brokerage businesses, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and third-party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third-party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of other insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations.   Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than stockholders and other investors. In the U.S., this system of regulation, generally administered by a department of insurance in each state in which we do business, affects the way we can conduct our insurance underwriting business. Furthermore, state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters.  14          Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit plan regulation, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and federal taxation, do affect the insurance industry generally and our insurance underwriting subsidiaries in particular. With respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses, the financial impact of use of capital restrictions and increased training and employee expenses. Furthermore, the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction.   In all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our businesses can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as they have been in the past.   Our significant global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.    A significant portion of our operations is conducted outside the U.S. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:    •the general economic and political conditions existing in those countries; •imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; •imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; •hyperinflation in certain foreign countries; •imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments; •longer payment cycles; •greater difficulties in accounts receivables collection; and •the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.    Some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse transaction and translation effects due to exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results.   Our financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing our underwriting reserves differ from actual experience.    We maintain reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by our insurance underwriting subsidiaries. The reserves that we maintain that could cause variability in our financial results consist of (1) unearned premium reserves, (2) policy and contract claim reserves and (3) future policy benefit reserves. Unearned premium reserves generally reflect our liability to return premiums we have collected under policies in the event of the lapse or cancellation of those policies. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, premiums we have collected generally become "earned" over the life of a policy by means of a reduction in the amount of the unearned premium reserve associated with the policy. Unearned premium reserves are particularly significant with respect  15      to our warranty business, given that the premiums we receive for warranty products generally cover an extended period of time. If there are significant lapses or cancellations of these types of policies, or expected losses for existing policies develop adversely and therefore premiums are not earned as expected, it may be necessary to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition expenses associated with the policies, because these deferred expenses are amortized over the projected life of the policies, or establish additional reserves to cover premium deficiencies.   Policy and contract claim reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees and general expenses for administering the claims adjustment process and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accounting period. If the reserves originally established for future claims prove inadequate, we would be required to increase our liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   The obligation for policy and contract claims does not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent our best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These estimates represent informed judgments based on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal developments and legislative changes, can cause our estimates to vary. The inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities, where the variables affecting these types of claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates are periodically refined as experience develops and further losses are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. Because setting the level of reserves for policy and contract claims is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.   Future policy benefit reserves generally reflect our liability to provide future life insurance benefits and future accident and health insurance benefits on guaranteed renewable and non-cancelable policies. Future policy benefit reserves on accident and health and life products have been provided on the net level premium method. These reserves are calculated based on assumptions as to investment yield, mortality, morbidity and withdrawal rates that were determined at the date of issue and provide for possible adverse deviations.   Each of our business lines may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity.    The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses and the premiums generated by our underwriting businesses. In particular, a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Moreover, the results of our consulting business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. As our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to delay or forgo consulting engagements with us.   We have substantial debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.    We have substantial debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.1 billion. This substantial amount of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility.  16       A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility.    In 2004, Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered its ratings on our senior debt to the current rating of "BBB+" from "A-". In addition, S&P placed all their ratings for Aon on credit watch with negative implications. Also in 2004, Moody's Investor Services (Moody's) and Fitch, Inc. placed both our senior debt and commercial paper ratings on negative outlook and credit watch with negative implications, respectively.   In 2005, Fitch, Inc. lowered its ratings on our senior debt from "A-" to "BBB+" and affirmed our commercial paper rating of "F2." They removed us from credit watch and changed their outlook from negative to stable. S&P affirmed its ratings for Aon, removed us from credit watch and changed their outlook from negative to stable and later to positive. Moody's affirmed its ratings on our senior debt and changed their outlook from negative to stable.   A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper would increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility. In addition, any further downgrade may trigger obligations of our company to fund certain amounts with respect to our premium finance securitizations. Moreover, some of our debt instruments, such as our 6.20% notes due January 2007 ($250 million of which are outstanding), expressly provide for interest rate increases in the case of certain ratings downgrades. Similarly, any such downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether. We cannot assume that our financial position would not be adversely affected if we are unable to access the commercial paper market. A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt may also adversely affect the claims-paying ability or financial strength ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries. See "A decline in the financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may increase policy cancellations and negatively impact new sales of insurance products" above.   Recent and proposed accounting rule changes could negatively affect our financial position and results.    The FASB is considering several accounting rule changes, including proposals on pension accounting, intangibles and SPEs, among others. Whether these proposals will become final rules are uncertain, as is their final content. However, if enacted, these proposals could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.   In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment ("Statement No. 123(R)") which is a revision of Statement No. 123. Statement No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25 and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement No. 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement No. 123.   Through 2005, we followed APB No. 25 for share-based payments to employees. As such, we expensed the cost of stock awards over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Generally, we were required to disclose proforma compensation expense for stock options but were not required to recognize compensation expense. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, Statement No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Proforma disclosure is no longer an alternative.   See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.   We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.    Our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries, including our insurance underwriting companies. We have to rely on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to  17      stockholders and corporate expenses. Payments from our underwriting subsidiaries are limited by governmental regulation and depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries. In some circumstances, specific payments from our insurance underwriting subsidiaries may require prior regulatory approval and we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries at times and in the amounts we anticipate or require.   The volume of premiums we write and our profitability are affected by the availability of reinsurance and the size and adequacy of our insurance company subsidiaries' capital base.    The level of business that our insurance underwriting subsidiaries are able to write depends on the size and adequacy of their capital base. Many state insurance laws to which they are subject impose risk-based capital requirements for purposes of regulating insurer solvency. Insurers having less statutory surplus than that required by the risk-based capital model formula generally are subject to varying degrees of regulatory scrutiny and intervention depending on the level of capital inadequacy. As of December 31, 2005, each of our insurance company subsidiaries substantially exceeds NAIC risk-based statutory surplus requirements.   We purchase reinsurance for certain of the risks underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase, which may affect the level of business we are able to write and our profitability. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities or that we can obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. If we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, either our net exposures would increase or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures, we would have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments. Either of these potential developments could adversely affect our underwriting business.   We cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion, if at all.    To better manage our portfolio of underwriting risk, we purchase reinsurance by transferring part of the risk that we assume (known as ceding) to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium that we receive in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred (or ceded) to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Recently, due to industry and general economic conditions, there is an increasing risk of insolvency among reinsurance companies, resulting in a greater incidence of litigation and affecting the recoverability of claims. We cannot assure that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis.      Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.
