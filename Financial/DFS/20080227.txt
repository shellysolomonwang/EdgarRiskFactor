Item 1A. Risk Factors  You should carefully consider each of the following risks described below and all of the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K in evaluating us. Our business, financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks.  This annual report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”  Risks Related to Our Business  We face competition from other credit card issuers, and we may not be able to compete effectively, which could result in fewer customers and lower account balances and could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  The credit card issuing business is highly competitive, and we compete with other credit card issuers on the basis of a number of factors, including: merchant acceptance, products and services, incentives and reward programs, brand, network, reputation and pricing. This competition, among other things, affects our ability to obtain applicants for our credit cards, encourage cardmembers to use our credit cards, maximize the revenue generated by card usage and generate cardmember loyalty and satisfaction so as to minimize the number of cardmembers switching to other credit card brands. Competition is also increasingly based on the value provided to the cardholder by rewards programs. Many credit card issuers have instituted rewards programs that are similar to ours, and issuers may in the future institute rewards programs that are more attractive to cardmembers than our programs. In addition, because most domestically issued credit cards, other than those issued by American Express, are issued on the Visa and MasterCard networks, most other card issuers benefit from the dominant position and marketing and pricing power of Visa and MasterCard. If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to take aggressive actions in response to competitors’ actions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  We incur considerable expenses in competing with other credit card issuers, and many of our competitors have greater scale, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.  We incur considerable expenses in competing with other credit card issuers to attract and retain cardmembers and increase card usage. A substantial portion of these expenses relates to marketing expenditures; however, traditional customer acquisition methods have become increasingly challenging. Telemarketing has been hampered by the Federal Trade Commission’s National Do Not Call Registry, which had increased to almost 152 million phone numbers as of January 2008. Direct mail response rates have fallen, with market researcher Synovate reporting that, in the industry, only five out of every 1,000 offers generated responses in 2006 compared to approximately 28 out of every 1,000 in 1992.  Because of the highly competitive nature of the credit card issuing business and increasing marketing challenges, a primary method of competition among credit card issuers, including us, is to offer low introductory interest rates and balance transfer programs that offer a favorable annual percentage rate or other financial incentives for a specified length of time on account balances transferred from another credit card. This type of competition has adversely affected credit card yields, and many cardholders now frequently switch credit cards or transfer their balances to another card. There can be no assurance that any of the expenses we incur or incentives we offer to attempt to acquire and maintain accounts and increase card usage will be effective.  Furthermore, many of our competitors are larger than we are, have greater financial resources than we do and/or have lower capital costs and operating costs than we have and expect to have, and have assets such as branch locations and co-brand relationships that may help them compete more effectively. In addition, there is an     19    Table of Contents  increasing trend toward consolidation among credit card issuers, resulting in even greater pooled resources. We may be at a competitive disadvantage as a result of the greater scale of many of our competitors.  We face competition from other operators of payment networks, and we may not be able to compete effectively, which could result in reduced transaction volume, limited merchant acceptance of our cards, limited issuance of cards on our network by third parties and materially reduced earnings.  We face substantial and increasingly intense competition in the payments industry. We compete with other payment networks to attract third-party issuers to issue credit and debit cards and other card products on the Discover and PULSE Networks. Competition with other operators of payment networks is generally based on issuer interchange fees, other economic terms, merchant acceptance and network functionality. Competition also is based on service quality, brand image, reputation and market share.  Many of our competitors are well established, larger than we are and/or have greater financial resources than we do. These competitors have provided financial incentives to card issuers, such as large cash signing bonuses for new programs, funding for and sponsorship of marketing programs and other bonuses. Visa and MasterCard have each been in existence for more than 40 years and enjoy greater merchant acceptance and broader global brand recognition than we do. In addition, Visa and MasterCard have entered into long-term arrangements with many financial institutions that may have the effect of preventing them from issuing credit cards on the Discover Network or issuing debit cards on the PULSE Network. MasterCard completed an initial public offering, which provided it with significant capital and may enhance its strategic flexibility. Visa also intends to undertake an initial public offering. American Express is also a strong competitor, with international acceptance, high transaction fees and an upscale brand image.  Furthermore, as a result of their dominant market position and considerable marketing and pricing power, in recent years Visa and MasterCard have been able to aggressively increase transaction fees charged to merchants in an effort to retain and grow their issuer volume. If we are unable to remain competitive on issuer interchange and other incentives, we may be unable to offer adequate pricing to third-party issuers while maintaining sufficient net revenues. At the same time, increasing the transaction fees charged to merchants or increasing acquirer interchange could adversely affect our effort to increase merchant acceptance of credit cards issued on the Discover Network and may cause merchant acceptance to decrease. See “—Our transaction volume is concentrated among large merchants, and a reduction in the number of, or rates paid by, merchants that participate in the Discover Network could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.” This, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to attract third-party issuers and our ability to maintain or grow revenues from our proprietary network. Similarly, the PULSE Network operates in the highly competitive PIN debit business with well-established and financially strong network competitors (particularly Visa) that have the ability to offer more attractive economics and bundled products to financial institutions.  In addition, if we are unable to maintain sufficient network functionality to be competitive with other networks, our ability to attract third-party issuers and maintain or increase the revenues generated by our proprietary card issuing business may be materially adversely affected. An inability to compete effectively with other payment networks for the reasons discussed above or any other reason could result in reduced transaction volume, limited merchant acceptance of our cards, limited issuance of cards on our network by third parties and materially reduced earnings.  Our business depends on our ability to manage our credit risks, and failing to manage these risks successfully may result in high charge-off rates or impede our growth.  We market our products to a wide range of consumers, and our success depends on our ability to continue to manage our credit risk while attracting new cardmembers with profitable usage patterns. We select our cardmembers, manage their accounts and establish terms and credit limits using proprietary scoring models and other analytical techniques designed to set terms and credit limits such that we are appropriately compensated for the credit risk we accept, while encouraging cardmembers to use their available credit. The models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our cardmembers may not accurately predict future charge-     20    Table of Contents  offs due to, among other things, inaccurate assumptions or models. While we continually seek to improve our assumptions and models, we may make modifications that unintentionally cause them to be less predictive. We also may incorrectly interpret the data produced by these models in setting our credit policies. Our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by economic conditions, legal or regulatory changes (such as bankruptcy laws, minimum payment regulations and re-age guidance), competitors’ actions and consumer behavior, as well as inadequate collections staffing, techniques, models and vendor performance.  A cardmember’s ability to repay us can be negatively impacted by changes in their payment obligations under mortgage loans, including subprime mortgage loans. Such changes can result from changes in economic conditions including increases in base lending rates upon which payment obligations are based and structured increases in payment obligations, which in turn could adversely impact the ability of our cardmembers to meet their payment obligations to other lenders and to us and could result in higher credit losses in our portfolio.  Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future charge-offs. For instance, bankruptcy rates in the United Kingdom have increased significantly in recent years as a result of the relaxation of the bankruptcy laws, which has contributed to increases in charge-off rates in our U.K. operations. There can be no assurance that our lending standards will protect us against high charge-off levels. In addition, because an important source of our funding is the securitization market, an increase in delinquencies and/or charge-offs could increase our cost of funds or unintentionally cause an early amortization event. See “—We may be unable to securitize our receivables at acceptable rates or at all, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cost of funds, reserves and capital requirements.”  We have already launched and plan to expand in several card and consumer lending sectors. Areas of particular focus include: a small business card, which we launched in 2006; relaunching the Miles by Discover Card product, which occurred in 2007; launching personal loan and student lending products, which occurred in 2007; and prepaid cards. We also continuously refine and test our credit criteria, which results in some instances in approving applications that did not previously meet our underwriting criteria. We have less experience in these areas as compared to our traditional products and segments, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our credit risk or generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses in these markets. Our failure to manage our credit risks may materially adversely affect our profitability and ability to grow.  Economic downturns, financial market events and other conditions beyond our control could materially adversely affect our business.  Economic downturns, financial market events and other conditions beyond our control may adversely affect consumer spending, asset values, investments, financial market liquidity, consumer indebtedness and unemployment rates, which in turn can negatively impact our business. If general economic conditions in the United States or United Kingdom deteriorate or interest rates increase, the number of transactions, average purchase amount of transactions, or average balances outstanding on our cards may be reduced, which would reduce transaction fees and interest income and thereby adversely affect profitability. In addition, high levels of unemployment, low levels of spending, deteriorating housing markets, recessions or other conditions, including terrorism, natural disasters or the outbreak of diseases, may adversely affect the ability and willingness of cardmembers to pay amounts owed to us, which would increase delinquencies and charge-offs and could materially adversely affect our business.  Changes in the level of interest rates could materially adversely affect our earnings.  Changes in interest rates cause our interest expense to increase or decrease, as certain of our debt instruments carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. If we are unable to pass our higher cost of funds to our customers, the increase in interest expense could materially adversely affect earnings. Some of our managed receivables bear interest at a fixed rate or do not earn interest, and we may not be able to increase the rate on those loans to mitigate our higher cost of funds. At the same time, our variable rate managed receivables, which are based on a market benchmark, may not change at the same rate as our floating rate debt instruments or may be subject to a cap.    21    Table of Contents Interest rates may also adversely impact our delinquency and charge-off rates. Many consumer lending products bear interest rates that fluctuate with certain base lending rates published in the market, such as the prime rate and the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). As a result, higher interest rates often lead to higher payment requirements by consumers under obligations to us or other lenders, which may reduce their ability to remain current on their obligations to us and thereby lead to loan delinquencies and additions to our loan loss provision, which could materially adversely affect our earnings.  In connection with our spin-off from Morgan Stanley, we have incurred additional indebtedness that could restrict our operations.  In recent years, Morgan Stanley provided a significant portion of our funding. Since our spin-off from Morgan Stanley, we finance our capital needs with third party funding. We have entered into a multi-year unsecured committed credit facility of $2.5 billion, which contains customary restrictions, covenants and events of default. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” The terms of this facility and any future indebtedness impose various restrictions and covenants on us (such as tangible net worth requirements) that could have adverse consequences, including,        •    limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders;        •    increasing our vulnerability to changing economic, regulatory and industry conditions;        •    limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;        •    limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and        •    requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other purposes.  Our total combined indebtedness as of November 30, 2007 was approximately $30.0 billion, as compared to $21.6 billion at November 30, 2006. The increase in indebtedness primarily represents incremental deposits obtained to establish a liquidity reserve, the balance of which was approximately $8.3 billion and was included in cash and cash equivalents at November 30, 2007. We may also incur additional substantial indebtedness in the future.  We may be unable to securitize our receivables at acceptable rates or at all, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cost of funds, reserves and capital requirements.  The securitization of credit card receivables, which involves the transfer of receivables to a trust and the issuance by the trust of beneficial interests to third-party investors, is our largest single source of funding. Factors affecting our ability to securitize our credit card receivables at acceptable pricing levels, or at all, include the overall credit quality of our receivables, negative credit ratings action affecting our asset-backed securities (or Discover Bank), the stability of the market for securitization transactions, investor demand, and the legal, regulatory, accounting and tax requirements governing securitization transactions. For example, the current subprime mortgage crisis has created a disruption in the capital markets and caused a weakening in demand for asset-backed securities, including those for credit card receivables. In addition, changes to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, as amended (“Statement No. 140”), are being discussed which may make it more difficult for us to maintain sale accounting treatment for our securitizations under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) or may require us to recognize securitized receivables on our consolidated and combined statements of financial condition, which could substantially increase the allowance for loss requirements and Discover Bank’s regulatory capital requirements and result in changes in the timing of the recognition of income from securitization transactions.  Our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our securitization transactions. Credit card     22    Table of Contents  securitizations are normally structured as “revolving transactions” that do not distribute to securitization investors their share of monthly principal payment on the receivables during the revolving period, and instead use those payments to fund the purchase of replacement receivables. The occurrence of “early amortization events” may result in termination of the revolving period of our securitization transactions. Early amortization events include, for example, insufficient cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, certain breaches of representations, warranties or covenants in the agreements relating to the securitization, and bankruptcy or insolvency.  If we are unable to continue to securitize our credit card receivables at acceptable pricing levels, or at all, including by reason of the early amortization of any of our securitization transactions, we would seek to liquidate investment securities, increase bank deposits and use alternative funding sources to fund increases in loan receivables and meet our other liquidity needs. In the event of an economic early amortization, receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from us would instead continue to be recognized on our consolidated and combined statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset-backed securities. Recognizing these receivables would require us to obtain alternative funding.  The inability to continue to securitize our credit card receivables at acceptable pricing levels, or at all, could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cost of funds, reserves and capital requirements. In addition, liquidation of investment securities and available alternative funding sources may be insufficient to meet the ongoing funding needs of our business if we are unable to continue to securitize our credit card receivables. For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”  An inability to accept or obtain brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and funding costs.  The FDIA prohibits a bank, including our subsidiaries Discover Bank and Bank of New Castle, from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well-capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is adequately capitalized and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well-capitalized. While Discover Bank and Bank of New Castle each met the FDIC’s definition of “well-capitalized” as of November 30, 2007, there can be no assurance that they will continue to meet this definition. We rely on third-party brokers to access the brokered deposit market, and brokered deposits may become unavailable to us due to the unwillingness of brokers to sell our deposits, as a result of a decline in our credit ratings or for other reasons. An inability to accept or obtain brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and funding costs.  We rely in part on unsecured and secured debt for our funding and the inability to access the U.S. or U.K. debt markets could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  While our primary sources of funding are securitizations and brokered deposits, we also are dependent on access to the U.S. and U.K. unsecured debt markets to fund our managed receivables as well as other assets. In general, the amount, type and cost of our funding directly affects the cost of operating our business and growing our assets and is dependent upon outside factors such as our credit rating from ratings agencies. Historically we have benefited from Morgan Stanley’s credit ratings. Since our spin-off, Discover Bank has maintained its BBB rating from Standard &Poor’s (“S&P”) and has been assigned a Baa2 deposit and Baa2 senior unsecured rating from Moody’s Investor Service (“Moody’s”) and a BBB rating from Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”). We have been assigned a BBB- long-term rating from S&P, a Baa3 senior unsecured rating from Moody’s and a BBB long-term rating from Fitch. A rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any particular security. In addition, there can be no assurance that a rating will be maintained for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn in its entirety. If our ratings are for any reason reduced or we are unable     23    Table of Contents  to access the U.S. or U.K. unsecured debt markets for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  In response to the exploration of the spin-off in 2005, Moody’s placed the asset-backed securities issued domestically by the Discover Card Master Trust I under review for a possible downgrade, which we believe contributed to a temporary disruption in our ability to access the securitization markets, increasing our reliance on intercompany funding and deposit markets. This disruption lasted approximately five months, at which time Moody’s reaffirmed the ratings on the asset-backed securities.  Declines in the value of, or income earned from, our retained interests in our securitization transactions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We retain interests in the assets transferred to or created in our securitization transactions and earn income from these assets. The value of our retained interests and the amount of income that we earn depend on many factors, including, among others, the revenues, performance and credit risk of the securitized loans, which are subject to the same risks and uncertainties as loans that we have not securitized. The value of our interests may also change because of changes in the assumptions used to estimate their fair value, such as market interest rates and other conditions, increases in bankruptcy or charge-off rates, payment rates and changes in the interpretation and application of accounting rules relating to such valuation. If the income that we earn from our retained interests in securitization transactions were to decrease or the value of our retained interests were to decrease, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  Our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by market fluctuations, which could negatively impact our financial condition.  We have an investment portfolio that we manage in accordance with our internal policies and procedures, including the investment of our liquidity reserve, which had a balance of approximately $8.3 billion as of November 30, 2007. Our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by market fluctuations including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, prices, credit risk premiums and overall market liquidity. Also, investments backed by collateral could be adversely impacted by changes in the value of the underlying collateral. Our fixed income investments are subject to market valuation risks from changes in the general level of interest rates. Recent increases in credit risk premiums can negatively impact the value of our securities. Certain markets have been experiencing disruptions in market liquidity, and the lack of a secondary market may adversely affect the valuation of certain of our investments. In addition, deteriorating economic conditions may cause certain of the obligors, counterparties and underlying collateral on our investments to incur losses of their own, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure to these investments. These risks could result in a decrease in the value of our investment portfolio, which could negatively impact our financial condition. For example, we recorded a loss on an investment in certain asset-backed commercial paper notes during the year ended November 30, 2007. See Note 4: Investment Securities to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements for further details.  We may be unable to increase or sustain Discover Card usage, which could impair growth in, or lead to diminishing, average balances and total revenue.  A key element of our strategy is to increase the usage of the Discover Card by our cardmembers, including making it their primary card, and thereby increase our revenue from transaction and service fees and our managed receivables. However, our cardmembers’ use and payment patterns may change because of social, legal and economic factors, and cardmembers may decide not to increase card usage or may decide to pay the balances within the grace period to avoid finance charges. We face challenges from competing credit card products in our attempts to increase credit card usage by our existing cardmembers. Our ability to increase cardmember usage also is dependent on cardmember satisfaction, which may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, including competitors’ actions. As part of our strategy to increase usage, we are seeking to increase the number of merchants who accept cards issued on the Discover Network. If we are unable to increase merchant acceptance of our cards, our ability to grow usage of Discover Cards may be hampered. As a result of these factors, we may be unable to increase or sustain credit card usage, which could impair growth in, or lead to diminishing, average balances and total revenue.    24    Table of Contents We may be unable to grow earnings if we do not attract new cardmembers, or if we attract cardmembers with unfavorable spending and payment habits.  We are seeking to increase managed receivables by attracting new cardmembers who will use their Discover Cards, meet their monthly payment obligations and maintain balances that generate interest and fee income for us. We are subject to substantial competition from other credit card issuers for these new cardmembers. We plan to continue marketing the Discover Card, but we may not have adequate financial resources to permit us to incur all of the marketing costs that may be necessary to maintain or grow our managed receivables or to attract new accounts. The spending and payment habits of these new cardmembers may not be sufficient to make their accounts as profitable as we expect. In addition, our risk models may not accurately predict the credit risk for these new cardmembers, which could result in unanticipated losses in future periods. To the extent that the spending and payment habits of new cardmembers do not meet our expectations, our earnings and growth may be negatively affected.  Our transaction volume is concentrated among large merchants, and a reduction in the number of, or rates paid by, merchants that participate in the Discover Network could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Discover Card transaction volume was concentrated among our top 100 merchants in 2007. These merchants may pressure us to reduce our rates by continuing to participate in the Discover Network only on the condition that we change the terms of their economic participation. At the same time, we are subject to increasing pricing pressure from third-party issuers as a result of the continued consolidation in the banking industry, which results in fewer large issuers that, in turn, generally have a greater ability to negotiate pricing discounts. In addition, many of our merchants, primarily our small and mid-size merchants, are not contractually committed to us for any period of time and may cease to participate in the Discover Network at any time on short notice.  In addition, actual and perceived limitations on acceptance of credit cards issued on the Discover Network could adversely affect the use of the Discover Card by existing cardmembers and the attractiveness of the Discover Card to prospective new cardmembers. Furthermore, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining third-party issuers if we are unable to add and retain acquirers or merchants who accept cards issued on the Discover or PULSE Networks. As a result of these factors, a reduction in the number of, or rates paid by, our merchants could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We may be unable to grow earnings if we are unable to increase the number of small and mid-size merchants that participate in the Discover Network.  In seeking to expand our merchant acceptance among small and mid-size merchants, we have recently entered into agreements with and have started to use third-party acquirers and processors to add merchants to the Discover Network and accept and process payments for these merchants on an integrated basis with Visa and MasterCard payments. This strategy could have unanticipated results, such as decreased revenues, higher expenses, degraded service and signage placement levels and retaliatory responses from competitors. There can be no assurance that the use of third-party acquirers and processors will continue to increase merchant acceptance among small or mid-size merchants, or that such third-party acquirers will continue to participate with us if more attractive opportunities arise. If we are unable to increase small and mid-size merchant acceptance, our ability to grow earnings could be adversely affected.  Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the increasing focus of merchants on the fees charged by credit card networks.  Merchant acceptance and fees are critical to the success of both our card issuing and payment processing businesses. Merchants have shown increasing concern with the levels of fees charged by credit card companies, and have in the past and may in the future seek to negotiate better pricing or other financial incentives as a condition to continued participation in the Discover Network. During the past few years, merchants and their trade groups have filed approximately 50 lawsuits against Visa, MasterCard, American Express and their card issuing banks, claiming that their practices toward merchants, including interchange fees, violate federal antitrust     25    Table of Contents  laws. There can be no assurance that they will not in the future bring legal proceedings against other credit card issuers and networks, including us. Merchants also may promote forms of payment with lower fees, such as PIN debit, or seek to impose surcharges at the point of sale for use of credit cards. The heightened focus by merchants on the fees charged by credit card networks, including us, could lead to reduced merchant acceptance of Discover Network cards or reduced fees, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our U.K. operations are currently not profitable, and there can be no assurance when or if they will become profitable.  The U.K. market is currently experiencing high delinquencies and bankruptcy levels, compounded by changing regulations, which have resulted in losses in our U.K. operations. Additionally, the United Kingdom has relatively low levels of interchange and fee income and lower net interest margin, which has resulted in and may continue to result in insufficient revenues to compensate for the current levels of loan losses. Our U.K. operations also have a relatively higher cost structure given their smaller scale. In addition to the challenging market conditions described above, U.K. and European regulators have recently increased their focus on the credit card industry.  On February 7, 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell our credit card business in the United Kingdom to Barclays Bank Plc. The closing is expected to occur by the end of our second quarter of 2008 and is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Sale of International Card Segment; First Quarter 2008 Charge” for more information relating to the sale of our Goldfish business.  Our pending sale of our U.K. credit card business is subject to a variety of conditions and may not be completed.  On February 7, 2008, we and Barclays Bank Plc entered into a definitive sale and purchase agreement relating to the sale of our U.K. credit card business, which represents substantially all of our International Card segment. Completion of this sale is subject to a variety of conditions, many of which are outside of our control. If the transaction is not completed, we may have difficulty retaining key personnel of this business.  We expect to continue to incur significant expenses in the litigation we are pursuing against Visa and MasterCard, and there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in this action.  In October 2004, the DOJ prevailed in its antitrust litigation against Visa and MasterCard which challenged their exclusionary practices. Following this ruling, we filed a complaint against Visa and MasterCard seeking substantial damages for the market foreclosure caused by their anticompetitive rules. The trial date is expected to be no later than Fall 2008. We expect to continue to incur substantial legal expenses in the litigation we are pursuing against Visa and MasterCard. Outside counsel and consultant legal expenses for this litigation were approximately $42 million, $51 million and $8 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Expenses associated with this litigation in 2008 are expected to be slightly lower than 2007 expenses. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recovering any damages in this action. Upon resolution of the litigation, after expenses, we will be required to pay Morgan Stanley the first $700 million of value of cash or non-cash proceeds (increased at the rate of 6% per annum until paid in full) (the “minimum proceeds”), plus 50% of any proceeds in excess of $1.5 billion, subject to certain limitations and a maximum potential payment to Morgan Stanley of $1.5 billion. All payments by Discover to Morgan Stanley will be net of taxes payable by Discover with respect to such proceeds. If, in connection with or following a change of control of Discover, the litigation is settled for an amount less than the minimum proceeds, Discover will be required to pay Morgan Stanley an amount equal to the minimum proceeds. As a result of our agreement to pay the value of non-cash proceeds, we may be required to pay amounts to Morgan Stanley in excess of cash received in connection with the litigation. The value of non-cash proceeds will be determined by an independent third party.    26    Table of Contents Visa and MasterCard may impose additional restrictions on issuing banks, merchants or merchant acquirers that materially adversely affect the Discover or PULSE Networks, or the Discover Card issuing business.  Visa and MasterCard aggressively seek to protect their networks from competition and have used their rules and policies to do so. For example, in the past they enacted and enforced rules that prohibited their member banks from issuing cards on competing payment networks such as Discover. These rules were ultimately found to violate the antitrust laws. They have adversely affected our business in the past, and they may have lingering effects going forward. Visa and MasterCard also may enact new rules or enforce other rules in the future, including limiting the ability of issuing banks to use the PULSE Network, which may materially adversely affect our ability to compete.  If fraudulent activity associated with our cards increases, our brands could suffer reputational damage, the use of our cards could decrease and our fraud losses could be materially adversely affected.  We are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants, cardmembers and other third parties handling cardmember information. Credit and debit card fraud, identity theft and related crimes are prevalent and perpetrators are growing ever more sophisticated. Our financial condition, the level of our fraud charge-offs and other results of operations could be materially adversely affected if fraudulent activity were to significantly increase. In addition, significant increases in fraudulent activity could lead to regulatory intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance) and reputational and financial damage to our brands, which could negatively impact the use of our cards and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business.  If our security systems, or those of merchants, merchant acquirers or other third parties containing information about cardholders, are compromised, we may be subject to liability and damage to our reputation.  Our security protection measures, including the security of transaction information processed on our systems or the systems or processing technology of third parties participating in the Discover or PULSE Networks, may not be sufficient to protect the confidentiality of information relating to cardholders or transactions processed on the Discover or PULSE Networks. Cardholder data also may be stored on systems of third-party service providers and merchants that may have inadequate security systems. Third-party carriers regularly transport cardholder data, and they may lose sensitive cardholder information. Unauthorized access to the Discover or PULSE Networks or any other Discover information systems potentially could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems or transmitted by our cardmembers or others. If our security systems or those of merchants, processors or other third-party service providers are compromised such that this confidential information is disclosed to unauthorized parties, we may be subject to liability. The preventive measures we take to address these factors are costly, and may become more costly in the future. Moreover, these measures may not protect us from liability, which may not be adequately covered by insurance, or from damage to our reputation.  The financial services and payment services industries are rapidly evolving, and we may be unsuccessful in introducing new products or services in response to this evolution.  The financial services and payment services industries experience constant and significant technological changes, such as continuing development of technologies in the areas of smart cards, radio frequency and proximity payment devices, electronic commerce and mobile commerce, among others. The effect of technological changes on our business is unpredictable.  We depend in part on third parties for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that new services and technologies relating to the payments business will continue to appear in the market, and these new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies that we currently use in our card products and services. As a result, our future success is in part dependent on our ability to identify and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards and to provide payment solutions for our cardmembers and merchant and financial institution customers.  Difficulties or delays in the development, production, testing and marketing of new products or services may be caused by a number of factors including, among other things, operational, capital and regulatory     27    Table of Contents  constraints. The occurrence of such difficulties may affect the success of our products or services, and developing unsuccessful products and services could result in financial losses, as well as decreased capital availability. In addition, the new products and services offered may not be attractive to our cardmembers and merchant and financial institution customers.  If key technology platforms such as our transaction authorization and settlement systems become obsolete, or if we encounter difficulties processing transactions efficiently or at all, our revenue or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  We have a large technology staff utilizing current technology. There is no assurance that we may be able to sustain our investment in new technology to avoid obsolescence of critical systems and applications. Further, our transaction authorization and settlement systems may encounter service interruptions due to system or software failure, fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance or local telecommunications access, terrorism or accident. Some of our transaction processing systems are operated at a single facility and could be subject to service interruptions in the event of failure. Our services could be disrupted by a natural disaster or other problem at any of our primary or back-up facilities or our other owned or leased facilities.  We also depend on third-party service providers for the timely transmission of information across our data transportation network and for other telecommunications and technology services, including ancillary transaction processing services for the PULSE Network. Regardless of whether as a result of natural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism, termination of its relationship with us, or any other reason, if a service provider fails to provide the communications capacity or deliver services that we require or expect, the failure could interrupt our services and operations and hamper our ability to process cardholders’ transactions in a timely and accurate manner or to maintain thorough and accurate records of those transactions. Such a failure could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of the Discover and PULSE Networks and the quality of our brands, and could materially adversely affect our revenues or results of operations.  Merchant defaults may adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  As an issuer and merchant acquirer in the United States on the Discover Network, and an issuer in the United Kingdom on the MasterCard and Visa networks, we may be contingently liable for certain disputed credit card sales transactions that arise between cardholders and merchants. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, we will cause a credit or refund of the amount to be issued to the cardholder and charge back the transaction to the merchant or merchant acquirer. If we are unable to collect this amount from the merchant or a merchant acquirer, we will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Where the purchased product or service is not provided until some later date following the purchase, such as an airline ticket, the likelihood of potential liability increases. See Note 20: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the audited consolidated and combined financial statements.  Our success is dependent, in part, upon our executive officers and other key personnel, and the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.  Our success depends, in part, on our executive officers and other key personnel. Our senior management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. Moreover, our senior management team is relatively small and we believe we are in a critical period of competition in the financial services and payments industry. The market for qualified individuals is highly competitive, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel. The loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our business.  We may be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property, including our brands.  The Discover, Goldfish and PULSE brands are very important assets, and our success is dependent on our ability to protect these and our other intellectual property. We may not be able to successfully protect our intellectual property. If others misappropriate, use or otherwise diminish the value of our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.    28    Table of Contents Increased usage by consumers of credit sources such as home equity loans and mortgage refinancings instead of credit card borrowings could adversely affect our business.  During the last few years, lower interest rates and other factors have led to increased availability to consumers of credit sources such as home equity loans and mortgage refinancings at comparatively attractive interest rates. These and other options for consumer credit compete with our card products as alternative sources for consumer borrowing, as consumers may finance expenditures or refinance account balances with these alternative sources of credit. Increased usage by consumers of such alternative sources of credit could adversely affect our businesses.  Acquisitions that we pursue could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.  We may consider or undertake strategic acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies. If we do so, we may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any such businesses, products or technologies. In addition, the integration of any acquisition may divert management’s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We may allocate resources, such as time and money, on projects that do not increase our earnings. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash balances; similarly, if the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders.  We are subject to regulation by a number of different regulatory agencies, which have broad discretion to require us to alter our operations in ways that could adversely affect our business or subject us to penalties for noncompliance.  We must comply with an array of banking and consumer lending laws and regulations at the state, federal, U.K. and European levels, and these laws and regulations apply to almost every aspect of our business. We are subject to regulation and regular examinations by the FDIC, the Delaware Commissioner and the FSA. In addition, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Trade Commission, state banking regulators, the DOJ and European regulators, as well as the SEC and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) in our capacity as a public company. From time to time, these regulations and regulatory agencies have required us to alter certain of our operating practices, and may require us to do the same in the future. Our ability to introduce new products may be impaired or delayed as a result of regulatory review or failure to obtain required regulatory approvals. We conduct our business primarily through our banks, and various federal, state and European regulators have broad discretion to impose restrictions on our operations. U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws and rules, and laws and rules of foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business limit the manner and terms on which we may offer and extend credit. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to adverse consequences such as financial, structural, reputational and operational penalties, including receivership and litigation exposure and fines. In addition, efforts to abide by these laws and regulations may increase our costs of operations or limit our ability to engage in certain business activities, including affecting our ability to generate or collect receivables from cardmembers.  Changes in regulations, or the application thereof, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Periodically, legislators and regulatory authorities may enact new laws or regulations, or amend existing requirements to further regulate the industries in which we operate. Such new laws or rules could impose limits on the amount of interest or fees we can charge, curtail our ability to collect on account balances, increase compliance costs or materially affect us or the credit card industry in some other manner. For instance, in the past we have been obligated by industry-wide regulatory guidance to change our re-age policy to alter the terms under which delinquent accounts are returned to a current status, which negatively affected our charge-off and delinquency rates. Also, in response to industry-wide regulatory guidance, we increased minimum payment requirements on certain credit card loans and modified our overlimit fee policies and procedures to stop charging such fees for accounts meeting specific criteria, which have impacted, and we believe will continue to negatively impact, balances of credit card loans and related interest and fee revenue and charge-offs. We cannot predict whether any additional or similar regulatory changes will occur in the future.    29    Table of Contents Congress is considering legislation to restrict certain practices in the credit card industry, including those relating to grace periods, the two-cycle balance computation method (which we currently utilize on most of our products), risk-based and default-based interest rate changes, the allocation of payments, use of arbitration agreements and fees. It is not clear at this time whether new limitations on credit card practices will be adopted by Congress or at the state level and, if adopted, what impact such new limitations would have on us. The Federal Reserve is also revising disclosure and other rules for credit cards that could impact our business. In addition, the laws governing bankruptcy and debtor relief in the United States, the United Kingdom or other countries where we have cardmembers, could also change, making it more expensive or more difficult for us to collect from our cardmembers. Congress is also considering granting the FDIC rulemaking authority under unfair and deceptive practices laws. Furthermore, various federal and state agencies and standard-setting bodies may, from time to time, enact new or amend existing accounting rules or standards that could impact our business practices or funding transactions.  Regulation of the credit card industry, including regulation applicable to Discover Card and merchants that accept it, has expanded significantly in recent years. For instance, financial institutions, including us, were required to implement an enhanced anti-money laundering program in 2002 pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act. Various U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and state legislatures are considering new legislation or regulations relating to credit card pricing, credit card repricing, use of consumer reports, credit card disclosures, patent reform, identity theft, privacy, data security and marketing that could have a direct effect on us and our merchant and financial institution customers.  In the United Kingdom, during the last three years there have been increasing regulatory initiatives with respect to late and overlimit fees, interchange fees and the sale of retail insurance products, a relaxation of bankruptcy laws and an increase in industry-wide consumer protection measures. We expect that these initiatives and measures will continue to increase our compliance costs and the risk of consumer complaints, litigation and regulatory inquiries, as well as materially adversely affect the economics of the International Card segment.  Current and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could inhibit the number of payment cards issued and increase our costs.  Regulatory pronouncements relating to consumer privacy, data use and security affect our business. In the United States, we are subject to the Federal Trade Commission’s and the banking regulators’ information safeguard rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The rules require that financial institutions (including us) develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have experienced a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security, including, in the United States, requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach. In the United States, there are a number of bills pending in Congress and in individual states, and there have been numerous legislative hearings focusing on these issues. In addition, most states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of certain types of security breaches, and several other states are considering similar legislation. In the United Kingdom, there are detailed regulations on data privacy under the European Commission Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) and the U.K. Data Protection Act of 1998, which are enforced by the Information Commissioner, the United Kingdom’s privacy regulator.  Regulation of privacy, data use and security may cause an increase in the costs to issue payment cards and/or may decrease the number of our cards that we or third parties issue. New regulations in these areas may also increase our costs to comply with such regulations, which could materially adversely affect our earnings. In addition, failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which we are subject, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, could result in fines, sanctions, penalties or other adverse consequences and loss of consumer confidence, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, overall business and reputation.    30    Table of Contents Legislation or regulation could be enacted requiring us to hold higher levels of capital, which we may not be able to obtain and which would reduce our return on capital.  Discover Bank and Bank of New Castle are subject to capital, funding and liquidity requirements prescribed by statutes, regulations and orders. If new legislation or regulations are enacted that increase the levels of regulatory capital that are required, we may be required to obtain additional capital. In addition, regulators have broad discretion to impose additional capital and other requirements on us, including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. Our ability to obtain additional capital would be dependent upon, among other things, general economic conditions, our financial performance and prospects, and our ability and willingness to make capital contributions to Discover Bank and Bank of New Castle. If we were required to increase capital for Discover Bank or Bank of New Castle, it would have the effect of reducing our return on capital. In addition, if Discover Bank and Bank of New Castle were to fail to meet these regulatory capital requirements, it would become subject to restrictions that could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct normal operations.  Litigation and regulatory actions could subject us to significant fines, penalties and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses.  Businesses in the credit card industry have historically been subject to various significant legal actions, including class action lawsuits and patent claims. Many of these actions have included claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. While we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreements with cardmembers, which has limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future or that we will not be subject to significant legal actions such as those to which some of our competitors have been subject. In addition, we may be involved in various actions or proceedings brought by governmental regulatory agencies in the event of noncompliance with laws or regulations, which could subject us to significant fines, penalties and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses.  Risks Related to our Spin-Off  Our cost of funding increased after our separation from Morgan Stanley, and our liquidity may decrease.  While Morgan Stanley provided a significant portion of our funding in recent years, it no longer provides any funding following our spin-off. We have lower credit ratings and more constrained liquidity than our former parent company, Morgan Stanley. Although our debt is currently rated investment grade, a credit ratings downgrade to below investment grade would reduce our investor base and increase our cost of funding. Our liquidity may also decrease, and we may be less able to withstand a liquidity stress event. We may also face additional challenges in the future, including more limited capital resources to invest in or expand our businesses.  Certain of our historical financial results are as a business segment of Morgan Stanley and therefore may not be representative of our results as a separate, stand-alone company.  Certain historical financial information we have included in this filing has been derived from Morgan Stanley’s consolidated financial statements and does not necessarily reflect what our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we operated as a separate, stand-alone company during the periods presented. Certain historical costs and expenses reflected in our audited consolidated and combined financial statements include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Morgan Stanley, including general corporate expenses, employee benefits and incentives. These allocations were based on what we and Morgan Stanley considered to be reasonable reflections of the historical utilization levels of these services required in support of our business. This historical information does not necessarily indicate what our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or costs and expenses would have been had we operated as a separate, stand-alone entity, nor is it indicative of what our results will be in the future as a publicly-traded stand-alone company.  The obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.  In connection with our recent separation from Morgan Stanley, we have become subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial     31    Table of Contents  condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. All of the procedures and practices required of us as a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley were established prior to the spin-off, but we have additional procedures and practices required of us as a separate, stand-alone public company. As a result, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur. Furthermore, the corporate infrastructure and other resources required to operate as a public company may divert management’s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements.  Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC. In connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal controls over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. We will be unable to issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration statement if we are not in compliance with Section 404. In addition, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.  As a result of our separation from Morgan Stanley we may experience increased costs resulting from a decrease in the purchasing power and other operational efficiencies we previously had due to our association with Morgan Stanley.  Prior to our separation from Morgan Stanley, we were able to take advantage of Morgan Stanley’s purchasing power in procuring goods, technology and services, including insurance, employee benefit support and audit services. As a smaller separate, stand-alone company, we may be unable to obtain goods, technology and services at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to the separation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Our tax liability may also increase due to increased state income taxes in the jurisdictions where combined filings were previously made with Morgan Stanley.  In connection with our separation from Morgan Stanley, we have assumed past, present and future liabilities related to our business, and have entered into agreements relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters which may be on terms less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with another party.  Pursuant to certain agreements we entered into with Morgan Stanley in connection with the spin-off, we have agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley for, among other matters, past, present and future liabilities related to our business. Such liabilities include unknown liabilities, which could be significant.  We entered into these agreements and other agreements relating to the ongoing provision of services and other matters with Morgan Stanley while still a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. Accordingly, the terms of those agreements may not reflect those that would have been reached with another party. If these agreements were to have been entered into with another party, we may have obtained more favorable terms than under these agreements.  We must abide by certain restrictions to preserve the tax treatment of the distribution of our common stock by Morgan Stanley and we must indemnify Morgan Stanley for taxes resulting from certain actions we take that cause the distribution to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction.  Morgan Stanley has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that, based on customary representations and qualifications, the distribution of our common stock by Morgan Stanley was tax-free to Morgan Stanley stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These representations include representations as to the satisfaction of certain requirements that must be met in order for the distribution to qualify for tax-free treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and state law. If any of the representations and assumptions upon which the ruling is based is untrue or incomplete in any material respect, Morgan Stanley may not be able to rely upon the ruling.  If the distribution were not to qualify for tax-free treatment under sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the Code, Morgan Stanley would recognize taxable gain equal to the excess of the fair market value of our stock over Morgan Stanley’s tax basis in our stock. Under certain circumstances, we would be required under the     32    Table of Contents  U.S. tax sharing agreement entered into between Morgan Stanley and us to indemnify Morgan Stanley for all or a portion of this liability. In addition, each holder who received our common stock in the distribution would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock received.  Even if the distribution otherwise qualifies as a tax-free distribution under the Code, current tax law generally creates a presumption that the distribution would be taxable to Morgan Stanley (but not to its stockholders) if we engage in, or enter into an agreement to engage in, a transaction that would result in a 50% or greater change, by vote or by value, in our stock ownership during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the distribution date, unless it is established that the transaction is not pursuant to a plan or series of transactions related to the distribution. Treasury regulations currently in effect generally provide that whether an acquisition transaction and a distribution are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, specific factors listed in the regulations. In addition, the regulations provide several “safe harbors” for acquisition transactions that are not considered to be part of a plan.  Under the U.S. tax sharing agreement entered into between Morgan Stanley and us, for a period of two years following the distribution, generally we may not take certain actions unless Morgan Stanley provides us with prior written consent for such action, or we provide Morgan Stanley with a tax ruling or rulings, or an unqualified opinion of counsel, in each case acceptable to Morgan Stanley, to the effect that the action will not affect the tax-free nature of the separation and distribution, but we will remain liable for any taxes and other liabilities imposed as a result of the separation and distribution failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction, as a result of such action. These restrictions may prevent us from entering into strategic or other transactions which might be advantageous to us or to our stockholders, such as issuing equity securities to satisfy our financing needs, acquiring businesses or assets by issuing equity securities, or mergers or other business combinations.  Our ability to operate our business effectively may suffer if we do not, quickly and cost effectively, establish our own financial, administrative and other support functions to operate as a stand-alone company.  Historically, we have relied on certain financial, administrative and other resources of Morgan Stanley to operate our business. In conjunction with our separation from Morgan Stanley, we have enhanced and will need to continue to enhance our own financial, administrative and other support systems or contract with third parties to replace Morgan Stanley’s systems. We will also need to continue to establish our own accounting and auditing policies and systems on a stand-alone basis.  Prior to our spin-off, Morgan Stanley performed many important corporate functions for our operations, including portions of human resources, information technology, accounting, office space leasing, corporate services and treasury. We estimate the annual costs associated with replacing these functions and establishing our own infrastructure related thereto, to be approximately $60 million. Prior to the spin-off, we entered into agreements with Morgan Stanley under which Morgan Stanley will provide some of these services to us on a transitional basis, for which we will pay Morgan Stanley. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including a change of control, Morgan Stanley may terminate these services. These services may not be sufficient to meet our needs and, after these agreements with Morgan Stanley expire or are terminated, we may not be able to replace these services at all or obtain these services at acceptable prices and terms. Any failure or significant downturn in our own financial or administrative policies and systems or in Morgan Stanley’s financial or administrative policies and systems during the transitional period could impact our results and could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In the United Kingdom, prior to our separation from Morgan Stanley, we shared a brand and bank charter with Morgan Stanley, and our primary card brand was “Morgan Stanley.” From the date of the spin-off, we have a limited right to use the Morgan Stanley brand for three years, following which we will not be able to use this brand. Our primary brand in the United Kingdom is Goldfish, and we will also utilize other brands. Transitioning to a new brand will result in increased marketing and transitional costs and may result in customer attrition.    33    Table of Contents Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This annual report on Form 10-K and materials we have filed or will file with the SEC (as well as information included in our other written or oral statements) contain or will contain certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
