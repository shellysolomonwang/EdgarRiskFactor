Item 1a. Risk Factors  As required the Company is providing the following cautionary statements which identify factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results. It is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors. Investors should not consider this list an exhaustive statement of all risks and uncertainties.     •   Historical Growth Rates          Continuance of the Company’s historical growth rate depends upon a number of uncertain events including the outcome of the Company’s strategies of expanding its penetration in global markets, introduction of new products and services, and acquisitions. Difficulties, delays or failure of the Company’s strategies could cause the future growth of the Company to differ materially from its historical growth rate.      •   Changes in the Volume of Debt Securities Issued in Domestic and/or Global Capital Markets and Changes in Interest Rates and Other Volatility in the Financial Markets          The Company’s results could be adversely affected by a reduction in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which Standard & Poor’s provides ratings services. In addition, increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered. A sustained period of market decline or weakness could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company’s results could also be adversely affected because of public statements or actions by market participants, government officials and others who may be advocates of increased regulation, regulatory scrutiny or litigation.      •   Changes in Educational Funding          The Company’s U.S. educational textbook and testing businesses may be adversely affected by changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in legislation, both at the federal and state level, changes in the state procurement process and changes in the condition of the local, state or U.S. economy. While in the past few years the availability of state and federal funding for elementary and high school education has improved due to legislative mandates such as No Child Left Behind (“NCLB”) and Reading First, future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues resulting in a decrease in educational funding.  2    Table of Contents        •   Cyclical Nature of Customers’ Businesses          A significant portion of the Company’s sales are to customers in educational markets. The School Education Group and the industry it serves are influenced strongly by the magnitude and timing of state adoption opportunities. Approximately 20 states currently use an adoption process to purchase textbooks. In the remaining states, known as “open territories”, textbooks are purchased independently by local districts or individual schools. The 2008 adoption market is projected to increase by approximately 10% to 15% as compared to 2007. While the adoption opportunities in 2008 and beyond are expected to increase there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in the new state adoption market or in open territories.      •   Changes in the Global Advertising Markets / Affiliation Agreements          Although advertising’s impact on the McGraw-Hill Companies is less than 5% of revenue, advertising is still a significant source of revenue in the Information & Media segment. In general, demand for advertising tends to correlate with changes in the level of economic activity in the United States and in the markets the Company serves. In addition, world, national and local events may affect advertising demand. Competition from other forms of media such as other magazines, broadcasters and Web sites, affects the Company’s ability to attract and retain advertisers. In addition, significant changes in the Company’s network affiliation agreements could affect the profitability of the Company’s broadcasting operations.      •   Possible Loss of Market Share or Revenue Through Competition or Regulation          The markets for credit ratings as well as research, investment and advisory services are very competitive. The Financial Services segment competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of ratings, research and investment advice, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and technological innovation. In addition, in some of the countries in which Standard & Poor’s competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. The financial services industry is also subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by the Financial Services segment are in certain cases regulated under the U.S. Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the National Association of Securities Dealers and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business. In the past several years the U.S. Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the European Commission, through the Committee of European Securities Regulators (“CESR”) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), a global group of securities commissioners, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Local, national and multinational bodies have considered and adopted other legislation and regulations relating to credit rating agencies from time to time and are likely to continue to do so in the future. The Company does not believe that any new or currently proposed legislation, regulations or judicial determinations would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, new legislation, regulations or judicial determinations applicable to credit rating agencies in the United States and abroad could affect the competitive position of Standard & Poor’s ratings services. Additional information on the SEC’s activities regarding rating agencies is provided in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of the Company’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders.      •   Broadcasting Regulations          The Company’s broadcast stations are subject to regulatory developments that may affect their future profitability. All television stations are subject to Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) regulation. Television stations broadcast under licenses that are generally granted and renewed for a period of eight years. The FCC regulates television station operations in several ways, including, but not limited to, employment practices, political advertising, indecency and obscenity, sponsorship identification, children’s programming, issue-responsive programming, signal carriage, ownership, and engineering, transmissions, antenna and other technical matters.      •   Introduction of New Products or Technologies          The Company operates in highly competitive markets that are subject to rapid change, and the Company must continue to invest and adapt to remain competitive. There are substantial uncertainties associated with the Company’s efforts to develop new products and services for the markets it serves. The Company makes significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may be lower than the margins the Company has experienced historically. The Company also could experience threats to its existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment within which the Company operates. The Company relies on its information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. The Company believes it has appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of its information technology including security from unauthorized access and business continuity. The Company’s operating results may be adversely impacted by unanticipated system failures or data corruption.    3    Table of Contents     •   Operating Costs and Expenses          The Company’s major expense categories include employee compensation and printing, paper, and distribution costs for product-related manufacturing. The Company offers its employees competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand its businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets the Company requires. In addition, the Company’s reported earnings may be adversely affected by changes in pension costs and funding requirements due to poor investment returns and/or changes in pension regulations. Paper prices fluctuate based on the worldwide demand and supply for paper in general and for the specific types of paper used by the Company. The Company’s overall paper price increase is currently limited due to negotiated price reductions, long-term agreements, and short-term price caps for a portion of paper purchases that are not protected by long-term agreements. The Company’s books and magazines are printed by third parties. The Company typically has multi-year contracts for the production of books and magazines, a practice which reduces price fluctuations over the contract term. Any significant increase in these costs could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. The Company makes significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives. Additionally, the Company makes significant investments in the development of programs for the el-hi market place. While the Company believes it is prudent in its investment strategies and execution of its implementation plans there is, however, no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.      •   Protection of Intellectual Property Rights          The Company’s products comprise intellectual property delivered through a variety of media, including print, broadcast and digital. The ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on the Company’s ability to defend its intellectual property against infringement. The Company’s operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.      •   Exposure to Litigation          The Company is involved in legal actions and claims arising from its business practices, as discussed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of the Company’s Annual Report to Shareholders, and faces the risk that additional actions and claims will be filed in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal proceeding or change in applicable legal standards could have a material effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.      •   Risk of Doing Business Abroad          As the Company expands its operations overseas, it faces the increased risks of doing business abroad, including inflation, fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates, changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, export and import restrictions, tariffs, nationalization, expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds, civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors. Adverse developments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and/or expected operating results.       Item 1b. Unresolved Staff Comments
