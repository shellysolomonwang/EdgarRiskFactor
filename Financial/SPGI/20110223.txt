Item 1a. Risk Factors  We are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results.  We operate in the financial, education, and business information markets. The business information markets include energy; automotive; construction; aerospace and defense; broadcasting; and marketing/research information services. Certain risk factors are applicable to individual markets while other risk factors are applicable company-wide.  Company-wide Risk Factors  Our ability to grow is dependent on a number of factors including the following:  Introduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability       •   We operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and new ways to deliver our products and services.         o   These investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically.         •   We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment within which we operate.        •   We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our operating results may be adversely impacted by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.    4    Table of Contents     A significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability       •   Our major expenses include employee compensation and printing, paper, and distribution costs for product-related manufacturing.         o   We offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.        o   We could experience changes in pension costs and funding requirements due to poor investment returns and/or changes in pension assumptions.        o   Paper prices fluctuate based on the worldwide demand and supply for paper in general and for the specific types of paper used by us. Our overall paper price increase is currently limited due to negotiated price reductions, long-term agreements, and short-term price caps for a portion of paper purchases that are not protected by long-term agreements.        o   Our books and magazines are printed by third parties and we typically have multi-year service contracts for the printing of books and magazines in order to reduce price fluctuations over the contract term.        o   We make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives as well as significant investments in the development of programs for the el-hi market place. Although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.    Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position       •   Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of media, including print, broadcast and digital. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. Our operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.    Exposure to litigation could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations       •   We are involved in legal actions and claims arising from our business practices, as discussed in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, and face the risk that additional actions and claims will be filed in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal proceeding or change in applicable legal standards could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.    Risk of doing business abroad       •   As we continue to expand our operations overseas, we face the increased risks of doing business abroad, including inflation, fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates, changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, export and import restrictions, tariffs, nationalization, expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds, civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors. Adverse developments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and/or expected operating results.    Risk Factors Specific to our Standard & Poor’s Segment  Changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets could have a material impact on our results of operations       •   Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which S&P provides credit ratings.        •   Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered.        •   A sustained period of market decline or weakness could have a material adverse effect on us.        •   Our results could be adversely affected because of public statements or actions by market participants, government officials and others who may be advocates of increased regulation, regulatory scrutiny or litigation.    Increased competition or regulation could result in a loss of market share or revenue       •   The markets for credit ratings are very competitive. S&P competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its ratings, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.    5    Table of Contents          •   In addition, in some of the countries in which S&P competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.        •   The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by S&P are in certain cases regulated under the U.S. Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.         o   In the past several years the U.S. Congress, the SEC, the European Commission, through the Committee of European Securities Regulators and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, a global group of securities commissioners, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies.        o   Local, national and multinational bodies have considered and adopted other legislation and regulations relating to credit rating agencies from time to time.         §   We do not believe that any such laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.         o   Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future. The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain.        o   Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders.    Risk Factors Specific to our McGraw-Hill Financial Segment  Increased competition or regulation could result in a loss of market share or revenue       •   The markets for financial research, investment and advisory services are very competitive. MH Financial competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and technological innovation.        •   The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by MH Financial are in certain cases regulated under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.         o   We do not believe that any such laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.        o   In the future, other laws, regulations and rules relating to financial information may be considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies.         o   Additional information regarding MH Financial is provided in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders.    Consolidation of customers could impact our available markets and revenue growth       •   Our businesses within our MH Financial segment have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the financial services industry. The current challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.    Risk Factors Specific to our McGraw-Hill Education Segment  Changes in educational funding could materially affect our education businesses       •   Our U.S. educational textbook and testing businesses may be adversely affected by changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in legislation, both at the federal and state level, changes in the state procurement process and changes in the condition of the local, state or U.S. economy.        •   While in the past few years the availability of state and federal funding for elementary and high school education had improved due to legislative mandates such as No Child Left Behind and Reading First, future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment, leading to budget issues resulting in a decrease in educational funding.    Our education businesses operate in a cyclical environment       •   A significant portion of our sales are to customers in educational markets. Our School Education Group and the industry it serves are influenced strongly by the magnitude and timing of state adoption opportunities. Approximately 20 states currently use an adoption process to purchase textbooks. In the remaining states, known as “open territories”, textbooks are    6    Table of Contents          purchased independently by local districts or individual schools. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in the state new adoption market or in open territories.    Risk Factors Specific to our McGraw-Hill Information & Media Segment  Changes in the global advertising markets could materially impact our results       •   Although advertising is less than 5% of our revenue, advertising is still a significant source of revenue in our I&M segment. In general, demand for advertising tends to correlate with changes in the level of economic activity in the United States and in the markets we serve. In addition, world, national and local events may affect advertising demand.        •   Competition from other forms of media such as other magazines, broadcasters and Web sites, affects our ability to attract and retain advertisers.    Our broadcasting operations are subject to regulatory development that could affect their profitability       •   All television stations are subject to Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulation. Television stations broadcast under licenses that are generally granted and renewed for a period of eight years. The FCC regulates television station operations in several ways, including, but not limited to, employment practices, political advertising, indecency and obscenity, sponsorship identification, children’s programming, issue-responsive programming, signal carriage, ownership, and engineering, transmissions, antenna and other technical matters.    Changes in the global automotive markets       •   Declines in the global automotive industry impacts our ability to sustain or grow our revenue streams associated with business intelligence to that market.
