Item 1a. Risk Factors  We are providing the following cautionary statements which identify all known material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical and expected results.  We operate in the financial, education, commercial and commodities markets. The commercial markets include automotive, construction, aerospace and defense, and marketing/research information services, while the commodities market includes energy. Certain risk factors are applicable to individual markets while other risk factors are applicable company-wide.  Company-Wide Risk Factors  Our ability to grow is dependent on a number of factors including the following:  Introduction of new products, services or technologies could impact our profitability        •    We operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs. In order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and new ways to deliver our products and services.        ¡      These investments may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically.        •    We could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment within which we operate.        •    We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our operating results may be adversely impacted by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.        •    We are in the process of migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. There can be no certainty that these initiatives will deliver the expected benefits. The failure to migrate successfully may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently. In addition, the failure to either deliver the application on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption.  A significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability        •    Our major expenses include employee compensation and printing, paper, and distribution costs for product-related manufacturing.        ¡      We offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.        ¡      We could experience changes in pension costs and funding requirements due to poor investment returns and/or changes in pension assumptions.        ¡      Paper prices fluctuate based on the worldwide demand and supply for paper in general and for the specific types of paper used by us. Our overall paper price increase is currently limited due to negotiated price reductions, long-term agreements, and short-term price caps for a portion of paper purchases that are not protected by long-term agreements.        ¡      Our books and magazines are printed by third parties and we typically have multi-year service contracts for the printing of books and magazines in order to reduce price fluctuations over the contract term.        ¡      We make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives as well as significant investments in the development of programs for the el-hi market place. Although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments.  Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position        •    Our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of media, including print and digital. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property against infringement. Our operating results may be adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets.  Exposure to litigation could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations        •    We are involved in legal actions and claims arising from our business practices, as discussed under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K and in Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and     8    Table of Contents       Supplementary Data, in this Form 10-K, and face the risk that additional actions and claims will be filed in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal proceeding or change in applicable legal standards could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.  Risk of doing business abroad        •    As we continue to expand our operations overseas, we face the increased risks of doing business abroad, including inflation, fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates, changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, export and import restrictions, tariffs, nationalization, expropriation, limits on repatriation of funds, civil unrest, terrorism, unstable governments and legal systems, and other factors. Adverse developments in any of these areas could cause actual results to differ materially from historical and/or expected operating results.  Risks associated with the proposed spin-off transaction        •    Our previously announced tax-free spin-off is complex in nature and subject to various regulatory approvals, including a favorable letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions. These factors could prevent the completion of or otherwise adversely affect or delay the proposed spin-off.        •    Completion of the spin-off requires significant time, effort, and expense. Any delays in the anticipated completion of the spin-off may increase the expenses which we incur to complete the transaction. The separated businesses could also face unanticipated problems in operating independently, and thus may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the separation.        •    If consummated, the spin-off will result in two separate independent public companies each of which will be a smaller, less diversified company than we currently are with a narrower business focus than we currently have. In addition, diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows may diminish. As such, it is possible that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility.        •    The spin-off transaction requires us to hire, retain and develop our senior management and a highly skilled workforce for two separate businesses. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop current leadership positions or to hire and retain a skilled workforce could affect our institutional knowledge base and our competitive advantage. Our employees may also be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the spin-off transaction. In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees and higher employee turnover.        •    In addition, we plan to outsource certain support functions to third-party service providers in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If the service providers that we outsource these functions to do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and depending on the function involved, we may experience business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or harm employee morale.  Risk Factors Specific to S&P Ratings  Changes in the volume of debt securities issued in domestic and/or global capital markets and changes in interest rates and other volatility in the financial markets could have a material impact on our results of operations        •    Unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities could reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuance for which S&P Ratings provides credit ratings.        •    Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered.        •    A sustained period of market decline or weakness could have a material adverse effect on us.        •    Our results could be adversely affected because of public statements or actions by market participants, government officials and others who may be advocates of increased regulation, regulatory scrutiny or litigation.  Increased competition or regulation could result in a loss of market share or revenue        •    The markets for credit ratings are competitive. S&P Ratings competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its ratings, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.        •    In addition, in some of the countries in which S&P Ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.    9    Table of Contents Increased domestic and foreign regulation of the credit rating industry may adversely impact S&P Rating’s business        •    The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by S&P Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the U.S. Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.        ¡      In the past several years the U.S. Congress, the SEC, the European Commission, through regulators including the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the European Securities and Markets Authority, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies.        ¡      Local, national and multinational bodies have considered and adopted other legislation and regulations relating to credit rating agencies from time to time.        ¡    We do not believe that any such laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.        ¡      Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to S&P Rating’s rating activities.        ¡      Additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K.  Risk Factors Specific to S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices  Increased competition or regulation could result in a loss of market share or revenue        •    The markets for financial research, investment and advisory services are very competitive. S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and technological innovation.        •    The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States and abroad. The businesses conducted by S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices are in certain cases regulated under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.        ¡      We do not believe that any such laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.        ¡      In the future, other laws, regulations and rules relating to financial information may be considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies.        ¡      Additional information regarding S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices is provided under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Form 10-K.  Consolidation of customers could impact our available markets and revenue growth        •    Our businesses within S&P Capital IQ / S&P Indices have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the financial services industry. The current challenging business environment and the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.  Risk Factors Specific to Commodities & Commercial  Increased domestic or foreign regulation of the oil price reporting industry may adversely impact Platts’ business        •    In the fall of 2011, the G20 Cannes Final Summit Declaration called upon the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), International Energy Forum, International Energy Agency and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to prepare recommendations to improve the functioning and oversight of price reporting companies by mid-2012.        •    In a meeting with representatives of IOSCO in January 2012, principals at IOSCO advised Platts management that among the recommendations the regulatory group is considering is establishment of formal oversight of price reporting organizations and their processes, or a self-regulatory oversight regime.        •    In addition, new rules that are expected to be adopted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in 2012 affecting transactions in oil derivatives may implicate Platts in relation to its administration of the Platts electronic window (eWindow) as a means of determining price assessments in oil. Similar new rules and regulations in Europe are currently under consideration, albeit on a slower time frame.    10    Table of Contents     •    We do not believe that any new regulatory or self-regulatory oversight regime, or any such new CFTC or other regulations or rules, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Changes in the global automotive markets        •    Declines in the global automotive industry impacts our ability to sustain or grow our revenue streams associated with business intelligence to that market.  Risk Factors Specific to McGraw-Hill Education Segment  Changes in educational funding could materially affect our education businesses        •    Our U.S. educational materials and testing businesses may be adversely affected by changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in federal or state legislation, changes in the state procurement processes and/or changes in the condition of the local, state or U.S. economy.        •    Although the elementary and high school education market has benefited over the last several years from programs funded under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 and, more recently, from additional programs funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, future changes in federal funding and/or state or local tax bases could create an unfavorable environment for education budgets, resulting in a decrease in educational spending.  Our education businesses operate in a cyclical environment        •    A significant portion of our sales are to customers in educational markets. Our School Education Group and the industry it serves are influenced strongly by the magnitude and timing of state adoption opportunities. Approximately 20 states currently conduct a state-level adoption process to review instructional materials, creating approved lists from which local school districts may select. In the remaining states, known as “open territories,” instructional materials are selected and purchased independently by local districts or individual schools. There is no guarantee that our materials will be successful in the state new adoption market or in open territories.  Item 1b. Unresolved Staff Comments
