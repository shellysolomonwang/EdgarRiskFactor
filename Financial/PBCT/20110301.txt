Item 1A. Risk Factors  Changes in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition  People’s United Financial makes most of its earnings based on the difference between interest it earns compared to interest it pays. This difference is called the “interest spread.” People’s United Financial earns interest on loans and to a much lesser extent on securities and short-term investments. These are called “interest-earning assets.” People’s United Financial pays interest on some forms of deposits and on funds it borrows from other sources. These are called “interest-bearing liabilities.”  People’s United Financial’s interest spread can change depending on when interest rates earned on interest-earning assets change, compared to when interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities change. Some rate changes occur while these assets or liabilities are still on People’s United Financial’s books. Other rate changes occur when these assets or liabilities mature and are replaced by new interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities at different rates. It may be difficult to replace interest-earning assets quickly, since customers may not want to borrow money when interest rates are high, or People’s United Financial may not be able to make loans that meet its lending standards. People’s United Financial interest spread may also change based on the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  People’s United Financial interest spread may be lower if the timing of interest rate changes is different for its interest-earning assets compared to its interest-bearing liabilities. For example, if interest rates go down, People’s United Financial will earn less on some of its interest-earning assets while it is still locked into paying higher rates on some of its interest-bearing liabilities. On the other hand, if interest rates go up, People’s United Financial might have to pay more on some of its interest-bearing liabilities while it is still locked in to receiving lower rates on some of its interest-earning assets.  People’s United Financial manages this risk using many different techniques. If it is not successful in managing this risk, People’s United Financial may be less profitable.  Changes in Our Asset Quality Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition  Asset quality measures the performance of a borrower in repaying a loan, with interest, on time. In recent years, we have benefited from relatively stable asset quality. It is possible that our asset quality could deteriorate, depending upon economic conditions.    13    The Success of Our Stop & Shop Branches Depends on the Success of the Stop & Shop Brand  One element of our strategy is to focus on increasing deposits by providing a wide range of convenient services to our customers. An integral component of this strategy is People’s United Bank’s supermarket banking initiative, pursuant to which, as of December 31, 2010, People’s United Bank has established 84 full-service Stop & Shop branches that provide customers with the convenience of seven-day-a-week banking. At December 31, 2010, 25% of People’s United Bank branches were located in Stop & Shop supermarkets.  People’s United Bank currently has exclusive branching rights in Stop & Shop supermarkets in the state of Connecticut, in the form of a license agreement between The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company and People’s United Bank, which provides for the leasing of space to People’s United Bank within Stop & Shop supermarkets for branch use. People’s United Bank has the exclusive right to branch in these supermarkets until 2012, provided that People’s United Bank does not default on its obligations under the licensing agreement. People’s United Bank has the option to extend the license agreement until 2022.  Stop & Shop is currently the leading grocery store in Connecticut. The success of People’s United Bank supermarket branches is dependent, in part, on the success of the Stop & Shop supermarkets in which they are located. A drop in Stop & Shop’s market share, a decrease in the number of Stop & Shop locations or customers, or a decline in the overall quality of Stop & Shop supermarkets could result in decreased business for the Stop & Shop branches, in the form of fewer loan originations, lower deposit generation and fewer overall branch transactions, and could influence market perception of People’s United Bank Stop & Shop supermarket branches as convenient banking locations. Under the terms of the license agreement, People’s United Bank has the obligation to open branches in new Connecticut Stop & Shop locations through 2012, even if Stop & Shop’s market share declines or the value of the Stop & Shop brand is diminished.  We Depend on Our Executive Officers and Key Personnel to Continue the Implementation of Our Long-Term Business Strategy and Could Be Harmed by the Loss of Their Services  We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of our management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense, and the loss of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.  Our Business Is Affected by the International, National, Regional and Local Economy Generally, and the Geographic Concentration of Our Loan Portfolio and Lending Activities Makes Us Vulnerable to a Downturn in the Local Economy  Changes in international, national, regional and local economic conditions affect our business. If economic conditions change significantly or quickly, our business operations could suffer, and we could become weaker financially as a result.  In recent years, there has been a decline in the housing and real estate markets and in the general economy, both nationally and locally. Housing market conditions in the New England region of the United States, where much of our lending activity occurs, have deteriorated as evidenced by reduced levels of sales, increasing inventories of houses on the market, declining house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market. No assurance can be given that these conditions will improve or will not worsen or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income, an increase in our non-performing loans, an increase in our provision for loan losses or an adverse impact on our loan losses.  The past several years have been marked by significant volatility in the financial and capital markets initially brought about by the fallout associated with the subprime mortgage market. This disruption led to significant credit and liquidity concerns, which resulted in government intervention within the banking sector and a substantial decline in activity within the secondary mortgage market. All of these issues have been further exacerbated by an accelerated softening of the real estate market, a worsening recessionary economic environment and, in turn, weakness within the commercial sector.    14    Our loan portfolio is geographically diverse and, therefore, is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a prolonged downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease net interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and allowance for loan losses.  In Response to Competitive Pressures, Our Costs Could Increase if We Were Required to Increase Our Service and Convenience Levels or Our Margins Could Decrease if We Were Required to Increase Deposit Rates or Lower Interest Rates on Loans  People’s United Financial faces significant competition for deposits and loans. In deciding where to deposit their money, many people look first at the interest rate they will earn. They also might think about whether the bank offers other kinds of services they might need and, if they have ever been a customer of the bank before, what their experience was like. People also like convenience, so the number of offices and banking hours may be important. Some people also think that on-line services are important.  People’s United Financial competes with other banks, credit unions, brokerage firms and money market funds for deposits. Some people may decide to buy bonds or similar kinds of investments issued by companies or by the U.S., state and local governments and agencies, instead of opening a deposit account.  In making decisions about loans, many people look first at the interest rate they will have to pay. They also think about any extra fees they might have to pay in order to get the loan. Some people also think about whether the bank offers other kinds of services they might need and, if they have ever been a customer of the bank before, what their experience was like. Many business loans are more complicated because there may not be a standard kind of loan that meets all of the customer’s needs. Business borrowers look at many different factors that are not all financial in nature. Examples include the kind and amount of security the lender wants and other terms of the loan that do not involve the interest rate.  People’s United Financial competes with other banks, credit unions, credit card issuers, finance companies, mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers for loans. Insurance companies also compete with People’s United Financial for some kinds of commercial loans.  Many of People’s United Financial’s competitors have branches in the same market area as it does. Some of them are much larger than it is. The New England region, including Connecticut, which is People’s United Financial’s predominant market, and specifically Fairfield County, where People’s United Financial is headquartered, is an attractive banking market. Many locally-based banks have been acquired by large regional and national companies in the last several years. We expect this trend to continue. This means that there are not as many competitors in our market as there used to be, but the ones that are left are usually bigger and have more resources than the ones they acquired.  People’s United Financial also has competition from outside its own market area. A bank that does not have any branches in our primary markets can still have customers there by providing banking services on-line. It costs money to set up and maintain a branch system. Banks that do not spend as much money as People’s United Financial does on branches might be more profitable than it is, even if they pay higher interest on deposits and charge lower interest on loans.    15    Changes in Federal and State Regulation Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition  The banking business is heavily regulated by the federal and state governments. Banking laws and rules are for the most part intended to protect depositors, not stockholders.  Banking laws and rules can change at any time. The government agencies responsible for supervising People’s United Financial’s businesses can also change the way they interpret these laws and rules, even if the rules themselves do not change. We need to make sure that our business activities comply with any changes in these rules or the interpretation of the rules. We might be less profitable if we have to change the way we conduct business in order to comply. Our business might suffer in other ways as well.  Changes in state and federal tax laws can make our business less profitable. Changes in the accounting standards we are required to follow may also make us less profitable. Changes in the government’s economic and monetary policies may hurt our ability to compete for deposits and loans. Changes in these policies can also make it more expensive for us to do business.  The government agencies responsible for supervising our business can take drastic action if they think we are not conducting business safely or are too weak financially. They can force People’s United Financial to hold additional capital, pay higher deposit insurance premiums, stop paying dividends, stop making certain kinds of loans or stop offering certain kinds of deposits. If the agencies took any of these steps or other similar steps, it would probably make our business less profitable.  The letter from the OTS dated July 3, 2006 approving, among other things, People’s United Bank’s conversion from a Connecticut savings bank to a federal savings bank, granted People’s United Bank (i) a phase-in period of three years from the date of its conversion to a federal savings bank, August 18, 2006, to comply with the Home Owners’ Loan Act’s commercial loan limits, with the ability to seek an additional one-year extension if necessary (subsequently extended to January 1, 2011); and (ii) an exception from the Qualified Thrift Lender test for a period of four years from the date of its conversion to a federal charter. People’s United Bank is now subject to the Qualified Thrift Lender test and commercial loan limits imposed under the Home Owners’ Loan Act.  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act implements significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape, many of which will affect us. Among these changes are:        •    creation of a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection that is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection, and that will have exclusive power over our consumer compliance examinations;        •    restrictions on the ability of federal bank regulatory authorities to preempt the application of state consumer protection laws and regulations;        •    limitations on the amount of interchange fees that an issuer of debit cards may charge or receive;        •    stricter capital requirements for bank holding companies; and        •    elimination of the OTS as a separate Federal regulatory agency.  Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require subsequent regulatory rulemaking, and we can not predict how any new regulations will affect People’s United Financial.    16    People’s United Bank is currently regulated by the OTS as a federally-chartered savings bank, and People’s United Financial is currently regulated by the OTS as a savings and loan holding company. In July 2011, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is expected to assume responsibility for the supervision and regulation of all federally-chartered savings banks, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is expected to assume responsibility for the supervision and regulation of all savings and loan holding companies. We can not predict how this transfer of supervisory and regulatory authority may affect us.  If People’s United Financial’s Allowance for Loan Losses Is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Would Decrease  People’s United Financial is exposed to the risk that customers will not be able to repay their loans. This risk is inherent in the lending business. There is also the risk that the customer’s collateral will not be sufficient to cover the balance of their loan, as underlying collateral values fluctuate with market changes. People’s United Financial records an allowance for loan losses to cover probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized.  People’s United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: its historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate, commercial and equipment finance loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by its independent loan review function; an evaluation of delinquent and non-performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions.  While People’s United Financial seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, and at December 31, 2010, management believed that the allowance for loan losses was adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, it is possible that borrower defaults could exceed the current estimates for loan losses, which would reduce earnings. In addition, future increases to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, increasing charge-offs of existing problem loans, or the identification of additional problem loans and other factors, which would also reduce earnings.  Our Goodwill May be Determined to be Impaired at a Future Date Depending on the Results of Periodic Impairment Tests  People’s United Financial tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary. According to applicable accounting requirements, acceptable valuation methods include present-value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues, or similar performance measures. If the quoted market price for People’s United Financial common stock were to decline significantly, or if it was determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, we would be required to write down the asset recorded for goodwill as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. This, in turn, would result in a charge to earnings and, thus, a reduction in stockholders’ equity. See Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1, 2 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning People’s United Financial’s goodwill and the required impairment test.    17    People’s United Financial May Fail To Successfully Integrate Acquired Companies and Realize All of the Anticipated Benefits of an Acquisition  The ultimate success of an acquisition will depend, in part, on the ability of People’s United Financial to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of People’s United Financial with those of an acquired company. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, People’s United Financial must successfully combine its business with an acquired company. If People’s United Financial is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of a merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
