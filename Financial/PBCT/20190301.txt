Item 1A.  Risk Factors  Changes in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition  People’s United makes most of its earnings based on the difference between interest it earns compared to interest it pays. This difference is called the “interest spread.” People’s United earns interest on loans and to a much lesser extent on securities and short-term investments. These are called “interest-earning assets.” People’s United pays interest on some forms of deposits and on funds it borrows from other sources. These are called “interest-bearing liabilities.”  People’s United’s interest spread can change depending on when interest rates earned on interest-earning assets change, compared to when interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities change. Some rate changes occur while these assets or liabilities are still on People’s United’s books. Other rate changes occur when these assets or liabilities mature and are replaced by new interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities at different rates. It may be difficult to replace interest-earning assets quickly, since customers may not want to borrow money when interest rates are high, or People’s United may not be able to make loans that meet its lending standards. People’s United interest spread may also change based on the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  People’s United’s interest spread may be lower if the timing of interest rate changes is different for its interest-earning assets compared to its interest-bearing liabilities. For example, if interest rates go down, People’s United could earn less on some of its interest-earning assets while it is still obligated to pay higher rates on some of its interest-bearing liabilities. On the other hand, if interest rates go up, People’s United might have to pay more on some of its interest-bearing liabilities while it continues to receive lower rates on some of its interest-earning assets.  People’s United manages this risk using many different techniques. If unsuccessful in managing this risk, People’s United may be less profitable.  Changes in Our Asset Quality Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition  Asset quality measures the performance of a borrower in repaying a loan, with interest, on time. While we believe we have benefited from relatively stable asset quality, there are elements of our loan portfolio that inherently present greater credit risk, such as interest-only residential mortgage loans, home equity loans and lines with incomplete first lien data, and commercial real estate loans. Each of these portfolio risk elements, where potentially material in the context of our overall loan portfolio, are discussed in greater detail within Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Asset Quality beginning on page 56. While the Company believes that it manages asset quality through prudent underwriting practices and collection operations, it is possible that our asset quality could deteriorate, depending upon economic conditions and other factors.  The Success of Our Stop & Shop Branches Depends on the Success of the Stop & Shop Brand  One element of our strategy is to focus on increasing deposits by providing a wide range of convenient services to our customers. An integral component of this strategy is the Bank’s supermarket banking initiative, pursuant to which, as of December 31, 2018, the Bank has established 148 full-service Stop & Shop branches throughout Connecticut and southeastern New York, most of which are in close proximity to our traditional branches, which provide customers with the convenience of seven-day-a-week banking. At December 31, 2018, 35% of the Bank’s branches were located in Stop & Shop supermarkets and 13% of our total deposits at that date were held in Stop & Shop branches.  The Bank currently has exclusive branching rights in Stop & Shop supermarkets in the state of Connecticut and certain counties in the state of New York, in the form of licensing agreements between The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company and the Bank, which provides for the leasing of space to the Bank within Stop & Shop supermarkets for branch use. The Bank has the exclusive right to branch in these supermarkets until 2022, provided that the Bank does not default on its obligations under the licensing agreement.    11     Table of Contents  Under the terms of the licensing agreements, the Bank has the obligation to open branches in new Stop & Shop locations, even if Stop & Shop’s market share declines or the value of the Stop & Shop brand is diminished. The licensing agreements do not stipulate the number of branch openings per year but, rather, apply only to those new Stop & Shop locations that meet or exceed specified thresholds as to size (square footage) and/or customer traffic. Based on our experience, we would expect the application of these thresholds to result in the opening of approximately 2-4 new branches per year in Stop & Shop locations.  Stop & Shop is a leading grocery store in Connecticut. The success of the Bank’s supermarket branches is dependent, in part, on the success of the Stop & Shop supermarkets in which they are located. A drop in Stop & Shop’s market share, a decrease in the number of Stop & Shop locations or customers, or a decline in the overall quality of Stop & Shop supermarkets could result in decreased business for the Stop & Shop branches, in the form of fewer loan originations, lower deposit generation and fewer overall branch transactions, and could influence market perception of the Bank’s Stop & Shop supermarket branches as convenient banking locations.  We Depend on Our Executive Officers and Key Personnel to Continue Implementing Our Long-Term Business Strategy and Could Be Harmed by the Loss of Their Services  We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of our management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense, and the loss of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.  Our Business Is Affected by the International, National, Regional and Local Economies in Which We Operate  Changes in international, national, regional and local economic conditions affect our business. If economic conditions change significantly or quickly, our business operations could suffer, and we could become weaker financially as a result.  During certain economic cycles, the housing and real estate markets, as well as the broader economy, may experience declines, both on a national and local level. Housing market conditions in the New England and New York metro regions, where much of our lending activity occurs, may be adversely impacted, leading to a reduced level of sales, an increased inventory of houses on the market, a decline in house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market. No assurance can be given that these economic conditions will not occur or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income, an increase in our non-performing loans, an increase in our provision for loan losses or an adverse impact on our loan losses.  Significant volatility in the financial and capital markets during this time led to credit and liquidity concerns, a recessionary economic environment and, in turn, weakness within the commercial sector. Our loan portfolio is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a prolonged downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and allowance for loan losses.    12     Table of Contents  International economic uncertainty continues to have an impact on the U.S. financial markets, potentially suppressing stock prices and adding to volatility. Our foreign country exposure, which is defined as the aggregation of exposure maintained with financial institutions, companies or individuals in a given country outside of the U.S., is minimal and indirect, with the majority of such exposure comprised of corporate debt securities. Our sovereign credit exposure is comprised of an immaterial amount of government bonds issued by a single non-European sovereign.  The Geographic Concentration of Our Loan Portfolio Could Make Us Vulnerable to a Downturn in the Economies in Which We Operate  At December 31, 2018, 26%, 20% and 18% of the Company’s loans by outstanding principal amount were to customers located within Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts, respectively. Loans to people and businesses located in the New England states as a group represented 56% of total loans at that date. How well our business performs depends very much on the health of these regional and local economies. We could experience losses in our real estate-related loan portfolios if the prices for housing and other kinds of real estate decreased significantly in New England or southeastern New York.  If the economic environment deteriorates, or negative trends emerge with respect to the financial markets, the New England and southeastern New York economies could suffer more than the national economy. This would be especially likely in Fairfield County, Connecticut (where the Company is headquartered) as well as the suburban communities of New York City and Boston as a result of the significant number of people living in these areas who also work in the financial services industry.  In addition, our ability to continue to originate real estate loans may be impaired by adverse changes in the local and regional economic conditions in these real estate markets. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. In addition, if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, our profits may decrease because our alternative investments may earn less income for us than real estate loans.  Our equipment financing business, which operates nationally, could be negatively affected by adverse changes in the national economy, even if those changes have no significant effect on the local and regional economies in which our other businesses operate.  No assurance can be given that such conditions will not occur or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income, an increase in our non-performing loans, an increase in our provision for loan losses or an adverse impact on our loan losses.  In Response to Competitive Pressures, Our Costs Could Increase if We Were Required to Increase Our Service and Convenience Levels or Our Margins Could Decrease if We Were Required to Increase Deposit Rates or Lower Interest Rates on Loans  People’s United faces significant competition for deposits and loans. In deciding where to deposit their money, many people look first at the interest rate they will earn. They also might consider whether a bank offers other kinds of services they might need and, if they have been a customer of a bank before, what their experience was like. People also like convenience, so the number of offices and banking hours may be important. Some people also prefer the availability of on-line services.  People’s United competes with other banks, credit unions, brokerage firms and money market funds for deposits. Some people may decide to buy bonds or similar kinds of investments issued by companies or by federal, state and local governments and agencies, instead of opening a deposit account.    13     Table of Contents  In making decisions about loans, many people consider the interest rate they will have to pay. They also consider any extra fees they might have to pay in order to get the loan. Many business loans are more complicated because there may not be a standard type of loan that meets all of the customer’s needs. Business borrowers consider many different factors that are not all financial in nature, including the type and amount of security the lender wants and other terms of the loan that do not involve the interest rate.  People’s United competes with other banks, credit unions, credit card issuers, finance companies, mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers for loans. Insurance companies also compete with People’s United for some types of commercial loans.  Several of People’s United’s competitors have branches in the same market area as it does, some of which are much larger than it is. The New England region, including Connecticut, which is People’s United’s predominant market, and specifically Fairfield County, where People’s United is headquartered, is an attractive banking market. As locally-based banks continue to be acquired by large regional and national companies, there are not as many bank competitors in our market as there used to be, but the remaining ones are usually larger and have more resources than the banks they acquired.  People’s United also has competition from outside its own market area. A bank that does not have any branches in our primary markets can still have customers there by providing banking services on-line. It costs money to set up and maintain a branch system. Banks that do not spend as much money as People’s United does on branches might be more profitable than it is, even if they pay higher interest on deposits and charge lower interest on loans.  Changes in Federal and State Regulation Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition  The banking business is heavily regulated by the federal and state governments. Banking laws and rules are for the most part intended to protect depositors, not stockholders.  Banking laws and rules can change at any time. The government agencies responsible for supervising People’s United’s businesses can also change the way they interpret these laws and rules, even if the rules themselves do not change. We need to make sure that our business activities comply with any changes in these rules or the interpretation of the rules. We might be less profitable if we have to change the way we conduct business in order to comply. Our business might suffer in other ways as well.  Changes in state and federal tax laws or the accounting standards we are required to follow can make our business less profitable. Changes in the government’s economic and monetary policies may hurt our ability to compete for deposits and loans. Changes in these policies can also make it more expensive for us to do business.  The government agencies responsible for supervising our business can take drastic action if they think we are not conducting business safely or are too weak financially. They can force People’s United to hold additional capital, pay higher deposit insurance premiums, stop paying dividends, stop making certain kinds of loans or stop offering certain kinds of deposits. If the agencies took any of these steps or other similar steps, it would probably make our business less profitable.    14     Table of Contents  Enactment of the DFA has resulted in significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape, many of which affect us. Among the more significant provisions of the DFA, as well as their actual or anticipated impact, if quantifiable, are:        •    Changes to the regulatory landscape, including:        •    creation of the BCFP, which is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection, and exercise exclusive authority over our consumer compliance examinations; and        •    restrictions on the ability of federal bank regulatory authorities to preempt the application of state consumer protection laws and regulations.        •    Limitations on the amount of interchange fees that an issuer of debit cards may charge or receive:        •    The DFA limits the amount of interchange fee that an issuer of debit cards may charge or receive to an amount that is “reasonable and proportional” to the cost of the transaction. The DFA further provides that a debit card issuer may not restrict the number of payment card networks on which a debit card transaction may be processed to a single network or limit the ability of a merchant to direct the routing of debit card payments for processing.        •    Changes impacting the financial products and services we offer to our customers:        •    All federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the DFA. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s non-interest bearing deposits totaled $8.5 billion, or 24% of total deposits. The Company’s interest expense may increase and net interest margin may decrease if it begins to offer higher rates of interest than are currently offered on demand deposits.        •    Stricter capital requirements for bank holding companies:        •    The DFA imposes stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies by, among other things, imposing leverage ratios on holding companies and prohibiting the inclusion of new trust preferred issuances in Tier I capital. The DFA also increases regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions, which could limit the ability of People’s United to enter into, or increase the costs associated with, interest rate and other hedging transactions.        •    Mortgage rules promulgated by the BCFP:        •    The BCFP has issued a series of final rules to implement provisions in the DFA related to mortgage origination and mortgage servicing. These rules, which went into effect in January 2014 and which may increase the cost of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans, include:        •    A rule to implement the requirement that creditors make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer’s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling and establish certain protections from liability under this requirement for “qualified mortgages”; and        •    A rule addressing mortgage servicers’ obligations to: correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers; provide certain information requested by such borrowers; and provide protections to such borrowers in connection with force-placed insurance. Additionally, this final rule addresses servicers’ obligations to: provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers; establish policies and procedures for providing delinquent borrowers with continuity of contact with servicer personnel capable of performing certain functions; and evaluate borrowers’ applications for available loss mitigation options.  While it is difficult to fully quantify the increase in our regulatory compliance burden, we do believe that costs associated with regulatory compliance will continue to increase. Because certain other provisions of the DFA still require regulatory rulemaking, it is not clear how those new regulations will affect People’s United.    15     Table of Contents  If People’s United’s Allowance for Loan Losses Is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Would Decrease  People’s United is exposed to the risk that customers will not be able to repay their loans. This risk is inherent in the lending business. There is also the risk that the customer’s collateral will not be sufficient to cover the balance of their loan, as underlying collateral values fluctuate with market changes. People’s United records an allowance for loan losses to cover probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized.  People’s United maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed to be appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the respective loan portfolios, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: People’s United’s historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and equipment financing loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by People’s United’s independent loan review function; an evaluation of delinquent and non-performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions.  While People’s United seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations and, at December 31, 2018, believed that the allowance for loan losses was appropriate to cover probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, it is possible that borrower defaults could exceed the current estimates for loan losses, which would reduce earnings. In addition, future increases to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, increasing charge-offs of existing problem loans, or the identification of additional problem loans and other factors, which would also reduce earnings. See Note 1 (including the section entitled New Accounting Standards) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning People’s United’s allowance for loan losses.  Our Goodwill May be Determined to be Impaired at a Future Date Depending on the Results of Periodic Impairment Evaluations  People’s United evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or more frequently, if necessary). According to applicable accounting requirements, acceptable valuation methods include present-value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues, or similar performance measures. If the quoted market price for People’s United common stock were to decline significantly, or if it was determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, we would be required to write down the asset recorded for goodwill as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. This, in turn, would result in a charge to earnings and, thus, a reduction in stockholders’ equity. See Notes 1 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning People’s United’s goodwill and the required impairment test.  People’s United May Fail To Successfully Integrate Acquired Companies and Realize All of the Anticipated Benefits of an Acquisition  The ultimate success of an acquisition will depend, in part, on the ability of People’s United to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of People’s United with those of an acquired company. If People’s United is not able to successfully combine the businesses, the anticipated benefits of a merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.    16     Table of Contents  A Failure In or Breach Of Our Operational or Security Systems or Infrastructure, or Those of Our Third-Party Vendors and Other Service Providers, Including as a Result of Cyber-Attacks, Could Disrupt Our Business, Result in the Disclosure or Misuse of Confidential or Proprietary Information, Damage Our Reputation, Increase Our Costs and Cause Losses  In the ordinary course of business, we rely on our ability to securely process, record, monitor and store data associated with a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. In doing so, our business relies on various digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct operations, and for which we have information security procedures and controls in place. Still, as customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, breakdowns and security breaches.  Security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer or proprietary information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Further sources of operational and information security risk to us include (i) our customers, who, when accessing our products and services, may use computers or mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems and (ii) third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities (including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations) should they suffer breakdowns, failures or capacity constraints of their own systems.  In recent years, information security risks for financial institutions, such as ours, have increased due, in part, to (i) the proliferation of new technologies, including internet and mobile banking capabilities, to conduct financial transactions and (ii) the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, hostile foreign governments, activists and other external parties. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to, and disclosure of, client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. There have also been highly-publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information.  While we have not, to date, experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things: (i) the constantly evolving nature of these threats; (ii) the size and scale of People’s United; (iii) our plans to continue implementing our internet and mobile banking strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions in order to serve our customers when and how they want to be served; (iv) our expanded geographic footprint; (v) the outsourcing of some of our business operations; and (vi) the continued uncertain global economic environment. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to increase in number, intensity and sophistication, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.  Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational harm, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.    17     Table of Contents  Availability of First Lien Data With Respect to Our Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit Could Delay Our Response to Any Deterioration in the Borrower’s Credit  We do not currently have statistics for our entire portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit with respect to first liens serviced by third parties that have priority over our junior liens, as we did not historically capture that data on our loan servicing systems. As a result, we may therefore be unaware that the loan secured by the first lien is not performing, which could delay our response to an apparent deterioration in the borrower’s creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2018, full and complete first lien position data was not readily available for 31% of the home equity portfolio which, in turn, represented 2% of our overall loan portfolio at that date.  We are actively working with a third-party vendor to obtain the missing first lien information and have, in certain cases, obtained the data through information reported to credit bureaus when the borrower defaults. This data collection effort, however, can be more difficult in cases where more than one mortgage is reported in a borrower’s credit report and/or there is not a corresponding property address associated with a reported mortgage, in which case we are often unable to associate a specific first lien with our junior lien. See the discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Asset Quality—Portfolio Risk Elements—Home Equity Lending beginning on page 58 for more detail, including steps we are taking to otherwise address this issue.
