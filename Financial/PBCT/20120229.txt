Item 1A. Risk Factors  Changes in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition  People’s United Financial makes most of its earnings based on the difference between interest it earns compared to interest it pays. This difference is called the “interest spread.” People’s United Financial earns interest on loans and to a much lesser extent on securities and short-term investments. These are called “interest-earning assets.” People’s United Financial pays interest on some forms of deposits and on funds it borrows from other sources. These are called “interest-bearing liabilities.”    11    Table of Contents People’s United Financial’s interest spread can change depending on when interest rates earned on interest-earning assets change, compared to when interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities change. Some rate changes occur while these assets or liabilities are still on People’s United Financial’s books. Other rate changes occur when these assets or liabilities mature and are replaced by new interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities at different rates. It may be difficult to replace interest-earning assets quickly, since customers may not want to borrow money when interest rates are high, or People’s United Financial may not be able to make loans that meet its lending standards. People’s United Financial interest spread may also change based on the mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  People’s United Financial interest spread may be lower if the timing of interest rate changes is different for its interest-earning assets compared to its interest-bearing liabilities. For example, if interest rates go down, People’s United Financial will earn less on some of its interest-earning assets while it is still obligated to pay higher rates on some of its interest-bearing liabilities. On the other hand, if interest rates go up, People’s United Financial might have to pay more on some of its interest-bearing liabilities while it continues to receive lower rates on some of its interest-earning assets.  People’s United Financial manages this risk using many different techniques. If it is not successful in managing this risk, People’s United Financial may be less profitable.  Changes in Our Asset Quality Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition  Asset quality measures the performance of a borrower in repaying a loan, with interest, on time. In recent years, we have benefited from relatively stable asset quality. It is possible that our asset quality could deteriorate, depending upon economic conditions.  The Success of Our Stop & Shop Branches Depends on the Success of the Stop & Shop Brand  One element of our strategy is to focus on increasing deposits by providing a wide range of convenient services to our customers. An integral component of this strategy is People’s United Bank’s supermarket banking initiative, pursuant to which, as of December 31, 2011, People’s United Bank has established 87 full-service Stop & Shop branches throughout Connecticut, most in close proximity to our traditional branches, that provide customers with the convenience of seven-day-a-week banking. At December 31, 2011, 23% of People’s United Bank branches were located in Stop & Shop supermarkets.  People’s United Bank currently has exclusive branching rights in Stop & Shop supermarkets in the state of Connecticut, in the form of a license agreement between The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company and People’s United Bank, which provides for the leasing of space to People’s United Bank within Stop & Shop supermarkets for branch use. People’s United Bank has the exclusive right to branch in these supermarkets until 2022, provided that People’s United Bank does not default on its obligations under the licensing agreement.  Stop & Shop is currently the leading grocery store in Connecticut. The success of People’s United Bank supermarket branches is dependent, in part, on the success of the Stop & Shop supermarkets in which they are located. A drop in Stop & Shop’s market share, a decrease in the number of Stop & Shop locations or customers, or a decline in the overall quality of Stop & Shop supermarkets could result in decreased business for the Stop & Shop branches, in the form of fewer loan originations, lower deposit generation and fewer overall branch transactions, and could influence market perception of People’s United Bank Stop & Shop supermarket branches as convenient banking locations. Under the terms of the license agreement, People’s United Bank has the obligation to open branches in new Connecticut Stop & Shop locations through 2022, even if Stop & Shop’s market share declines or the value of the Stop & Shop brand is diminished.  We Depend on Our Executive Officers and Key Personnel to Continue the Implementation of Our Long-Term Business Strategy and Could Be Harmed by the Loss of Their Services  We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of our management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense, and the loss of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.    12    Table of Contents Our Business Is Affected by the International, National, Regional and Local Economies in Which We Operate  Changes in international, national, regional and local economic conditions affect our business. If economic conditions change significantly or quickly, our business operations could suffer, and we could become weaker financially as a result.  In recent years, there has been a decline in the housing and real estate markets and in the general economy, both nationally and locally. Housing market conditions in the New England region, where much of our lending activity occurs, have deteriorated as evidenced by reduced levels of sales, increasing inventories of houses on the market, declining house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market. No assurance can be given that these conditions will improve or will not worsen or that such conditions will not result in a decrease in our interest income, an increase in our non-performing loans, an increase in our provision for loan losses or an adverse impact on our loan losses.  The past several years have been marked by significant volatility in the financial and capital markets initially brought about by the fallout associated with the subprime mortgage market. This disruption led to significant credit and liquidity concerns, which resulted in government intervention within the banking sector and a substantial decline in activity within the secondary mortgage market. All of these issues have been further exacerbated by an accelerated softening of the real estate market, a worsening recessionary economic environment and, in turn, weakness within the commercial sector.  Our loan portfolio is geographically diverse and, therefore, is not immune to potential negative consequences arising as a result of general economic weakness and, in particular, a prolonged downturn in the housing market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In addition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an adverse impact on earnings. Further, an increase in loan delinquencies may serve to decrease net interest income and adversely impact loan loss experience, resulting in an increased provision and allowance for loan losses.  Our foreign country exposure, which is defined as the aggregation of exposure maintained with financial institutions, companies or individuals in a given country outside of the United States, is minimal and indirect, with the majority of such exposure comprised of corporate debt securities. Although our exposure to Europe is limited, the developing Eurozone crisis has strained the U.S. financial markets, suppressing stock prices and adding to volatility. Our sovereign credit exposure is also minimal and is comprised of an immaterial amount of government bonds issued by a single non-European sovereign.  In Response to Competitive Pressures, Our Costs Could Increase if We Were Required to Increase Our Service and Convenience Levels or Our Margins Could Decrease if We Were Required to Increase Deposit Rates or Lower Interest Rates on Loans  People’s United Financial faces significant competition for deposits and loans. In deciding where to deposit their money, many people look first at the interest rate they will earn. They also might think about whether the bank offers other kinds of services they might need and, if they have ever been a customer of the bank before, what their experience was like. People also like convenience, so the number of offices and banking hours may be important. Some people also think that on-line services are important.  People’s United Financial competes with other banks, credit unions, brokerage firms and money market funds for deposits. Some people may decide to buy bonds or similar kinds of investments issued by companies or by the U.S., state and local governments and agencies, instead of opening a deposit account.    13    Table of Contents In making decisions about loans, many people first look at the interest rate they will have to pay. They also think about any extra fees they might have to pay in order to get the loan. Many business loans are more complicated because there may not be a standard kind of loan that meets all of the customer’s needs. Business borrowers look at many different factors that are not all financial in nature, including the kind and amount of security the lender wants and other terms of the loan that do not involve the interest rate.  People’s United Financial competes with other banks, credit unions, credit card issuers, finance companies, mortgage lenders and mortgage brokers for loans. Insurance companies also compete with People’s United Financial for some kinds of commercial loans.  Many of People’s United Financial’s competitors have branches in the same market area as it does, some of which are much larger than it is. The New England region, including Connecticut, which is People’s United Financial’s predominant market, and specifically Fairfield County, where People’s United Financial is headquartered, is an attractive banking market. Many locally-based banks have been acquired by large regional and national companies in the last several years. We expect this trend to continue. This means that there are not as many competitors in our market as there used to be, but the ones that are left are usually bigger and have more resources than the ones they acquired.  People’s United Financial also has competition from outside its own market area. A bank that does not have any branches in our primary markets can still have customers there by providing banking services on-line. It costs money to set up and maintain a branch system. Banks that do not spend as much money as People’s United Financial does on branches might be more profitable than it is, even if they pay higher interest on deposits and charge lower interest on loans.  Changes in Federal and State Regulation Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition  The banking business is heavily regulated by the federal and state governments. Banking laws and rules are for the most part intended to protect depositors, not stockholders.  Banking laws and rules can change at any time. The government agencies responsible for supervising People’s United Financial’s businesses can also change the way they interpret these laws and rules, even if the rules themselves do not change. We need to make sure that our business activities comply with any changes in these rules or the interpretation of the rules. We might be less profitable if we have to change the way we conduct business in order to comply. Our business might suffer in other ways as well.  Changes in state and federal tax laws or the accounting standards we are required to follow can make our business less profitable. Changes in the government’s economic and monetary policies may hurt our ability to compete for deposits and loans. Changes in these policies can also make it more expensive for us to do business.  The government agencies responsible for supervising our business can take drastic action if they think we are not conducting business safely or are too weak financially. They can force People’s United Financial to hold additional capital, pay higher deposit insurance premiums, stop paying dividends, stop making certain kinds of loans or stop offering certain kinds of deposits. If the agencies took any of these steps or other similar steps, it would probably make our business less profitable. People’s United Bank is subject to the QTL test and commercial loan limits imposed under the HOLA.    14    Table of Contents On July 21, 2010, the DFA was signed into law. The DFA implements significant changes in the financial regulatory landscape, many of which will affect us. Among these changes are:        •    creation of the CFPB, which is empowered to promulgate new consumer protection regulations and revise existing regulations in many areas of consumer protection, and that will have exclusive power over our consumer compliance examinations;        •    restrictions on the ability of federal bank regulatory authorities to preempt the application of state consumer protection laws and regulations;        •    limitations on the amount of interchange fees that an issuer of debit cards may charge or receive;        •    stricter capital requirements for bank holding companies; and        •    elimination of the OTS as a separate federal regulatory agency.  Certain provisions of the DFA still require subsequent regulatory rulemaking, and we can not predict how any new regulations will affect People’s United Financial.  If People’s United Financial’s Allowance for Loan Losses Is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Would Decrease  People’s United Financial is exposed to the risk that customers will not be able to repay their loans. This risk is inherent in the lending business. There is also the risk that the customer’s collateral will not be sufficient to cover the balance of their loan, as underlying collateral values fluctuate with market changes. People’s United Financial records an allowance for loan losses to cover probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged to income. Losses on loans, including impaired loans, are charged to the allowance for loan losses when all or a portion of a loan is deemed to be uncollectible. Recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses when realized.  People’s United Financial maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that is deemed to be appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in the respective loan portfolios, based on a quarterly evaluation of a variety of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: People’s United Financial’s historical loan loss experience and recent trends in that experience; risk ratings assigned by lending personnel to commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and equipment financing loans, and the results of ongoing reviews of those ratings by People’s United Financial’s independent loan review function; an evaluation of delinquent and non-performing loans and related collateral values; the probability of loss in view of geographic and industry concentrations and other portfolio risk characteristics; the present financial condition of borrowers; and current economic conditions.  While People’s United Financial seeks to use the best available information to make these evaluations, and at December 31, 2011, management believed that the allowance for loan losses was appropriate to cover probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio, it is possible that borrower defaults could exceed the current estimates for loan losses, which would reduce earnings. In addition, future increases to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions, results of regulatory examinations, further information obtained regarding known problem loans, increasing charge-offs of existing problem loans, or the identification of additional problem loans and other factors, which would also reduce earnings.    15    Table of Contents Our Goodwill May be Determined to be Impaired at a Future Date Depending on the Results of Periodic Impairment Tests  People’s United Financial tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary. According to applicable accounting requirements, acceptable valuation methods include present-value measurements based on multiples of earnings or revenues, or similar performance measures. If the quoted market price for People’s United Financial common stock were to decline significantly, or if it was determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, we would be required to write down the asset recorded for goodwill as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. This, in turn, would result in a charge to earnings and, thus, a reduction in stockholders’ equity. See Critical Accounting Policies and Notes 1, 2 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning People’s United Financial’s goodwill and the required impairment test.  People’s United Financial May Fail To Successfully Integrate Acquired Companies and Realize All of the Anticipated Benefits of an Acquisition  The ultimate success of an acquisition will depend, in part, on the ability of People’s United Financial to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of People’s United Financial with those of an acquired company. If People’s United Financial is not able to successfully combine the businesses, the anticipated benefits of a merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.  A Failure In or Breach Of Our Operational or Security Systems or Infrastructure, or Those of Our Third Party Vendors and Other Service Providers, Including as a Result of Cyber Attacks, Could Disrupt Our Business, Result in the Disclosure or Misuse of Confidential or Proprietary Information, Damage Our Reputation, Increase Our Costs and Cause Losses  We depend upon our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.  Information security risks for financial institutions, such as ours, have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our business operations rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use electronic devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers’ devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ business operations.  Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.    16    Table of Contents Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, the size and scale of People’s United Financial, our plans to continue to implement our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our expanded geographic footprint, the outsourcing of some of our business operations and the continued uncertain global economic environment. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.  Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
