ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    An investment in our common stock involves risk, including the risk that the value of an investment may decline or that returns on that investment may fall below expectations. There are a number of significant factors which could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond management’s control or its ability to accurately forecast or predict, or could adversely affect our operating results and the value of any investment in our stock.     Our access to liquidity may be negatively impacted as disruptions in credit markets occur, if credit rating downgrades occur or if we fail to meet certain covenants. Funding costs may increase, leading to reduced earnings.   We need liquidity to meet our off-season working capital requirements, to service debt obligations including refinancing of maturing obligations and for other related activities. Our access to and the cost of liquidity could be negatively impacted in the event of credit-rating downgrades or if we fail to meet existing debt covenants. In addition, events could occur which could increase our need for liquidity above current levels.   If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, the cost of debt would likely increase and capital market access could decrease or become unavailable. Our unsecured committed line of credit (CLOC) is subject to various covenants, including a covenant requiring that we maintain minimum net worth equal to $650.0 million and a requirement that we reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount of short-term debt (as defined) to $200.0 million or less for a minimum period of thirty consecutive days during the period from March 1 to June 30 of each year. Violation of a covenant could impair our access to liquidity currently available through the CLOC. If current sources of liquidity were to become unavailable, we would need to obtain additional sources of funding, which may not be possible or may be available under less favorable terms.     H&R BLOCK 2011 Form 10K 7        Table of Contents    We are subject to potential contingent liabilities related to the loan repurchase obligations of Sand Canyon Corporation, which may result in significant financial losses.   Sand Canyon Corporation (SCC) remains exposed to losses relating to mortgage loans it previously originated. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole-loans to single third-party buyers or in the form of a securitization.   In connection with the securitization and sale of mortgage loans, SCC made certain representations and warranties. These representations and warranties vary based on the nature of the transaction and the buyer’s requirements but generally pertain to the ownership of the loan, the property securing the loan and compliance with applicable laws and SCC underwriting guidelines. In the event that there is a breach of a representation and warranty and such breach materially and adversely affects the value of a mortgage loan, SCC may be obligated to repurchase a loan or otherwise indemnify certain parties for losses incurred as a result of loan liquidation. In some instances, H&R Block, Inc. was required to guarantee SCC’s obligations related to breaches of representations and warranties. These representations and warranties and corresponding repurchase obligations generally are not subject to stated limits or a stated term, but would be subject to statutes of limitations applicable to the contractual provisions.   SCC records a liability for contingent losses relating to representation and warranty claims by estimating loan repurchase and indemnification obligations for both known claims and projections of future claims. To the extent that future valid claim volumes exceed current estimates, or the value of mortgage loans and residential home prices decline, future losses may be greater than these estimates and those differences may be significant. See Item 8, note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.     SCC is subject to potential investigations and lawsuits stemming from its discontinued mortgage operations, which may result in significant financial losses.   Although SCC terminated its mortgage loan origination activities and sold its loan servicing business during fiscal year 2008, it remains subject to investigations, claims and lawsuits pertaining to its loan origination and servicing activities prior to such termination and sale. The costs involved in defending against and/or resolving these investigations, claims and lawsuits may be substantial in some instances and the ultimate resulting liability is difficult to predict. In the current non-prime mortgage environment, the number and frequency of investigations, claims and lawsuits has increased over historical experience and is likely to continue at increased levels. In the event of unfavorable outcomes, the amount SCC may be required to pay in the discharge of liabilities or settlements could be substantial and, because SCC’s operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.     Failure to comply with laws and regulations that protect our customers’ personal and financial information could result in significant fines, penalties and damages and could harm our brand and reputation.   Privacy concerns relating to the disclosure of consumer financial information have drawn increased attention from federal and state governments. The IRS generally prohibits the use or disclosure by tax return preparers of taxpayers’ information without the prior written consent of the taxpayer. In addition, other regulations require financial service providers to adopt and disclose consumer privacy policies and provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to “opt-out” of having personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third-parties for marketing purposes. Breaches of our clients’ privacy may occur. To the extent the measures we have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties or damages and harm to our brand and reputation.   In addition, changes in these federal and state regulatory requirements could result in more stringent requirements and could result in a need to change business practices, including how information is disclosed. Establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these new requirements may increase costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.     The lines of business in which we operate face substantial litigation, and such litigation may damage our reputation or result in material liabilities and losses.   We, and/or our subsidiaries, have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our various business activities. Adverse outcomes related to litigation could result in substantial damages and could cause our earnings to decline. Negative public opinion can also result from our actual or alleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation and could cause the market price of our stock to decline. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.     8 H&R BLOCK 2011 Form 10K       Table of Contents    We are subject to operational risk and risks associated with our controls and procedures, which may result in incurring financial and reputational losses.   There is a risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, theft or fraud. These can occur in many forms including, among others, errors, business interruptions arising from natural disasters or other events, inadequate design and development of products and services, inappropriate behavior of or misconduct by our employees or those contracted to perform services for us, and vendors that do not perform in accordance with their contractual agreements. These events could potentially result in financial losses or other damages. We utilize internally developed processes, internal and external information and technological systems to manage our operations. We are exposed to risk of loss resulting from breaches in the security or other failures of these processes and systems. Our ability to recover or replace our major operational systems and processes could have a significant impact on our core business operations and increase our risk of loss due to disruptions of normal operating processes and procedures that may occur while re-establishing or implementing information and transaction systems and processes. As our businesses are seasonal, our systems must be capable of processing high volumes during peak season. Therefore, service interruptions resulting from system failures could negatively impact our ability to serve our customers, which in turn could damage our brand and reputation, or adversely impact our profitability. Additionally, due to the seasonality of our tax business, we employ a substantial amount of seasonal tax professionals on an annual basis. If we were unable to hire a sufficient amount of seasonal tax professionals, it could negatively impact our ability to serve customers, which in turn could damage our brand and reputation, or adversely impact our profitability.   We also face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures may prove to be inadequate or that our controls and procedures may be circumvented, thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information. It is possible that any lapses in the effective operations of controls and procedures could materially affect earnings or harm our reputation. Lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting could also be material to us.     Our businesses may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions, particularly if unemployment levels do not improve or continue to increase.   The difficult economic conditions we are currently experiencing are frequently characterized by higher unemployment levels and declining consumer and business spending. Poor economic conditions may negatively affect demand and pricing for our services. Higher unemployment levels, especially within client segments we serve, may result in clients no longer being required to file tax returns, electing not to file tax returns, or clients seeking lower cost preparation and filing alternatives. Continued higher unemployment levels may negatively impact our ability to increase tax preparation clients.   In addition to mortgage loans, we also extend secured and unsecured credit to other customers, including EAs to our tax clients. We may incur significant losses on credit we extend, which in turn could reduce our profitability.     Economic conditions that negatively affect housing prices and the job market may result in deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolio primarily held by HRB Bank, and such deterioration could have a negative impact on our business and profitability.   The overall credit quality of mortgage loans held for investment is impacted by the strength of the U.S. economy and local economic conditions, including residential housing prices. Economic trends that negatively affect housing prices and the job market could result in deterioration in credit quality of our mortgage loan portfolio and a decline in the value of associated collateral. Future interest rate resets could also lead to increased delinquencies in our mortgage loans held for investment. Trends in the residential mortgage loan market continue to reflect high loan delinquencies and lower collateral values. As a result, we recorded loan loss provisions totaling $35.6 million, $47.8 million and $63.9 million during fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.   Our loan portfolio is concentrated in the states of Florida, California, New York and Wisconsin, which represented 20%, 14%, 17% and 8%, respectively, of our total mortgage loans held for investment at April 30, 2011. No other state held more than 5% of our loan balances. If adverse trends in the residential mortgage loan market continue, particularly in geographic areas in which we own a greater concentration of mortgage loans, we could incur additional significant loan loss provisions.   Mortgage loans purchased from SCC represent 62% of total loans held for investment at April 30, 2011. These loans have experienced higher delinquency rates than other loans in our portfolio, and may expose us to greater risk of credit loss.     H&R BLOCK 2011 Form 10K 9        Table of Contents    TAX SERVICES     Government initiatives that simplify tax return preparation or expedite refunds could reduce the need for our services as a third-party tax return preparer. In addition, changes in government regulations or processes regarding the preparation and filing of tax returns and funding of tax refunds may increase our operating costs or reduce our revenues.   Many taxpayers seek assistance from paid tax return preparers such as us not only because of the level of complexity involved in the tax return preparation and filing process, but also because of paid tax return preparers’ ability to expedite refund proceeds under certain circumstances. From time to time, government officials propose measures seeking to simplify the preparation and filing of tax returns or to provide additional assistance with respect to preparing and filing such tax returns or expediting refunds. During tax season 2011, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) introduced a prepaid debit card pilot program designed to facilitate the refund process. HRB Bank provides this service as well through its H&R Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard®. Additionally, during tax season 2011, the IRS increased its emphasis on a process to allow taxpayers to allocate their refund to multiple accounts. The adoption or expansion of any measures that significantly simplify tax return preparation, expedite refunds or otherwise reduce the need for a third-party tax return preparer could reduce demand for our services, causing our revenues or results of operations to decline.   Governmental regulations and processes affect how we provide services to our clients. Changes in these regulations and processes may require us to make corresponding changes to our client service systems and procedures. The degree and timing of changes in governmental regulations and processes may impair our ability to serve our clients in an effective and cost-efficient manner or reduce demand for our services, resulting in the loss of a significant number of clients, causing our revenues or results of operations to decline.   Certain regulators have alleged that some of our competitors are lending tax preparation fees when they issue products similar to a RAC to their clients. An adverse ruling in this area could have a material impact on our offering of RACs resulting in the loss of a significant number of clients, causing our revenues or results of operations to decline.     Increased competition for tax preparation clients in our retail offices and our online and software channels could adversely affect our current market share and profitability, and could limit our ability to grow our client base. Offers of free tax preparation services could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.   We provide both retail and do-it-yourself tax preparation products and services and face substantial competition throughout our businesses. The retail tax services business is highly competitive. There are a substantial number of tax return preparation firms and accounting firms offering tax return preparation services. Many tax return preparation firms and many firms not otherwise in the tax return preparation business are involved in providing electronic filing and other related services to the public, and certain firms provide RALs and RACs. Commercial tax return preparers and electronic filers are highly competitive with regard to price and service, and many firms offer services that may include federal and/or state returns at no charge. Do-it-yourself tax preparation options include use of traditional paper forms, digital electronic forms and various forms of digital electronic assistance, including online and desktop software, both of which we offer. Our digital tax solutions businesses also compete with in-office tax preparation services and a number of online and software companies, primarily on the basis of price and functionality.   Federal and certain state taxing authorities currently offer, or facilitate the offer of, tax return preparation and electronic filing options to taxpayers at no charge. In addition, many of our direct competitors offer certain free online tax preparation and electronic filing options. We have free offerings as well and prepared 767,000, 810,000 and 788,000 federal income tax returns in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, at no charge as part of the FFA. In addition, we have free online tax preparation offerings and also provided free preparation of Federal 1040EZ forms in fiscal year 2011. Government tax authorities and direct competitors may elect to expand free offerings in the future. Intense price competition, including offers of free service, could result in a loss of market share, lower revenues or lower margins.   See tax returns prepared statistics included in Item 7, under “Tax Services.”     The elimination of the IRS debt indicator has caused federal and state regulators to scrutinize the RAL underwriting practices of third-party financial institutions that provide RALs.   In August 2010, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that, as of the beginning of the 2011 tax season, it would no longer furnish the debt indicator (DI), to tax preparers or financial institutions. The DI is an underwriting tool that lenders have historically used when considering whether to loan money to taxpayers who applied for a RAL, which is a short term loan, secured by the taxpayer’s federal tax refund.     10 H&R BLOCK 2011 Form 10K       Table of Contents    In December 2010, HSBC terminated its contract with us to provide RALs in our retail tax offices based on restrictions placed on HSBC by its regulators due to the DI no longer being available. As a result, RALs were not offered in our retail tax offices in the 2011 tax season. Subsequently, two other banks offering RALs during the 2011 tax season through our competitors announced that due to regulatory concerns they will not be offering RALs next tax season. Additionally, a third bank offering RALs during the 2011 tax season through our competitors announced that it was requesting an administrative hearing regarding a notice it had received from its regulator that its practice of originating RALs without the DI is “unsafe and unsound” and has recently filed a lawsuit in federal court against its regulator. Based on these developments and the overall limited amount of banks that offer RALs, there can be no assurances as to the availability of RALs in our retail tax offices in the future.   Termination of the contract with HSBC and our inability to secure a RAL originator in the future could continue to have adverse effects on our operating results, including declines in tax returns prepared as a result of clients seeking alternate preparers who may be able to offers RALs, to the extent prior RAL clients do not purchase a RAC or change their refund disbursement elections. A decline in clients could have other adverse impacts, including increased credit losses on loan balances with those clients.     We are subject to extensive government regulation, including banking rules and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable banking laws, rules and regulations, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, damages, penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business.   The OTS can, among other things, censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders or suspend or expel a bank or any of its officers or employees with respect to banking activities. Similarly, the attorneys general of each state could bring legal action on behalf of the citizens of the various states to ensure compliance with local laws.   HRB Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OTS. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may trigger actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on HRB Bank, and potentially us, as HRB Bank’s holding company. HRB Bank must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about the strength of components of its capital, risk-weightings of assets, off-balance sheet transactions and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require HRB Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of tangible equity, total risk-based capital and Tier 1 capital. In addition to these minimum ratio requirements, HRB Bank is required to continually maintain a 12.0% minimum leverage ratio.   In addition, the OTS may deem certain products offered by HRB Bank, including EAs, to be “unsafe and unsound” and thus require us to discontinue offering such products. To the extent such products are instrumental in attracting clients to our offices for tax preparation services, we could experience a significant loss of clients should such products be discontinued. This could cause our revenues or profitability to decline. See Item 8, note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of regulatory capital requirements and classifications.     Recent legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Reform Act) was signed into law, which contains a comprehensive set of provisions designed to govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets.   The full impact of the Reform Act is difficult to assess because many provisions require federal agencies to adopt implementing regulations. In addition, the Reform Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. The Reform Act, as well as other legislative and regulatory changes, could have a significant impact on us and on our subsidiary, HRB Bank, by, for example, requiring us to change our business practices, requiring us to meet more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, imposing additional costs on us, limiting fees we can charge for services, impacting the value of our assets, or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses. Specific provisions of the Reform Act include:            §   changes to the thrift supervisory structure as the responsibility and authority of the OTS moves to the OCC in July 2011;       §   changes which may require the Company, as a thrift holding company, to meet regulatory capital, liquidity, leverage or other standards;       §   regulation of interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for transactions in which a person uses a debit or general-use prepaid card, and enforcement of a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of the transaction to the issuer; and       H&R BLOCK 2011 Form 10K 11        Table of Contents             §   establishment of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations.     The effect of the Reform Act on our business and operations could be significant, depending upon final implementation of regulations, the actions of our competitors and the behavior of other marketplace participants. In addition, we may be required to invest significant management time and resources to address the various provisions of the Reform Act and the numerous regulations that are required to be issued under it. The Reform Act and any related legislation or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.     BUSINESS SERVICES     RSM receives a significant portion of its revenues from clients that are also clients of the Attest Firms. A termination of the alternative practice structure between RSM and the Attest Firms could result in a material loss of revenue to RSM and an impairment of our investment in RSM.   Under the alternative practice structure, RSM and the Attest Firms market their services and provide services to a significant number of common clients under a common brand – McGladrey. RSM also provides operational and administrative support services to the Attest Firms, including information technology, office space, non-professional staff, and other infrastructure in exchange for market rate fees from M&P. If the RSM/Attest Firms relationship under the alternative practice structure were terminated, RSM could lose key employees and clients. In addition, RSM may not be able to recoup its costs associated with the infrastructure used to provide the operational and administrative support services to the Attest Firms. This in turn could result in reduced revenue, increased costs and reduced earnings and, if sufficiently significant, impairment of our investment in RSM.     The RSM alternative practice structure involves relationships with Attest Firms that are subject to regulatory restrictions and other constraints. Failure to comply with these restrictions, or operational difficulties or litigation involving the Attest Firms, could damage our brand reputation, lead to reduced earnings and impair our investment in RSM.   RSM’s relationship with the Attest Firms requires compliance with applicable regulations related to the practice of public accounting and auditor independence. Many of RSM’s clients are also clients of the Attest Firms. In addition, the relationship with the Attest Firms and the common brand closely links RSM and the Attest Firms. If the Attest Firms encounter regulatory or independence issues pertaining to the alternative practice structure or if significant litigation arose involving the Attest Firms or their services, such developments could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the mutual benefits of our relationship. In addition, a significant judgment or settlement of a claim against an Attest Firm could (1) impair the Attest Firm’s, particularly M&P’s, ability to meet its payment obligations under various service arrangements with RSM, (2) impair the profitability of the APS, (3) impact RSM’s ability to attract and retain clients and quality professionals, (4) have a significant indirect adverse effect on RSM, as the Attest Firm partners are also RSM employees and (5) divert significant management attention. This, in turn, could result in reduced revenue and earnings and, if significant, impairment of our investment in RSM.        ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
