ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Our business activities expose us to a variety of risks. Identification, monitoring and management of these risks are essential to the success of our operations and the financial soundness of H&R Block. Senior management and the Board of Directors take an active role in our risk management process and have delegated oversight of risk management to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), which is comprised of senior managers of major businesses and control functions. The ERMC is responsible for identifying and monitoring risk exposures and leading the continued development of our risk management policies and practices.  An investment in our common stock involves risk, including the risk that the value of an investment may decline or that returns on that investment may fall below expectations. There are a number of significant factors which could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond management’s control or its ability to accurately estimate or predict, or could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and the value of any investment in our stock.  RISKS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS  Increased competition for tax preparation clients in our retail offices and our online and software channels could adversely affect our current market share and profitability. Offers of free tax preparation services could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  We provide both assisted and do-it-yourself tax preparation products and services and face substantial competition throughout our businesses. The assisted tax services business is highly competitive. There are a substantial number of tax return preparation firms and accounting firms offering tax return preparation services. Many tax return preparation firms and many firms not otherwise in the tax return preparation business are involved in providing electronic filing and other related services to the public, and certain firms provide RACs. Commercial tax return preparers and electronic filers are highly competitive with regard to price and service, and many firms offer services that may include federal and/or state returns at no charge. Do-it-yourself tax preparation options include use of traditional paper forms and various forms of digital electronic assistance, including online and desktop software, all of which we offer. Our digital tax solutions businesses also compete with in-office tax preparation services and a number of online and software companies, primarily on the basis of price and functionality. Intense price competition could result in a loss of market share, lower revenues or lower margins.  Federal and certain state taxing authorities currently offer, or facilitate the offer of, tax return preparation and electronic filing options to taxpayers at no charge. In addition, many of our direct competitors offer certain free online tax preparation and electronic filing options. In order to compete, we also have free tax service offerings in several categories. We prepared 861,000, 767,000 and 810,000 federal income tax returns in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, at no charge as part of the FFA. We also have free online tax preparation offerings and provided free preparation of Federal 1040EZ forms in fiscal years 2012 and 2011, and free RACs to certain clients in fiscal year 2012. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract clients or effectively monetize all of our free tax service offerings, and clients who have formerly paid for our tax service offerings may elect to use free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, and harm our ability to acquire and retain clients.  Government tax authorities and direct competitors may also elect to expand free offerings in the future. Although the FFA has kept the federal government from being a direct competitor to our tax service offerings, it has fostered additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities. We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.  See tax returns prepared statistics included in Item 7, under “Tax Services – Operating Statistics.”  Failure to comply with laws and regulations that protect our clients’ and employees’ personal and financial information could harm our brand and reputation and could result in significant fines, penalties and damages.  A number of our businesses collect, use and retain large amounts of personal client information and data, including credit card numbers, tax return information, bank account numbers and social security numbers. In addition, we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal client and employee information is held and some transactions are executed by third          8   H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K   Table of Contents  parties. In addition, some of our products and services are internet-based and we store a large amount of data for our users on our servers, including personal information. We and our vendors use commercially available security technologies to protect transactions and personal information. We use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information. However, individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures, and errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information may result in a breach of client or employee privacy or theft of assets, which may require notification under applicable data privacy regulations. We employ contractors and temporary employees who may have access to the personal information of clients and employees or who may execute transactions in the normal course of their duties. While we conduct background checks and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these controls could be circumvented, resulting in a security breach.  We are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure and security of consumer financial information, which have drawn increased attention from federal and state governments. The IRS imposes various prohibitions on the use or disclosure by tax return preparers of taxpayers’ information without the prior written consent of the taxpayer. In addition, other regulations require financial service providers to adopt and disclose consumer privacy policies and provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to “opt-out” of having personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third-parties. New laws in this area have been passed by several jurisdictions, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These new laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications. In addition, changes in these federal and state regulatory requirements could result in more stringent requirements and could result in a need to change business practices, including how information is disclosed. Establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these new requirements may increase costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.  A major breach of our security measures or those of third parties that execute transactions or hold and manage personal information may have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including reduced client demand for our services, harm to our reputation and brands, possible fines, penalties and damages, further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies, and loss of our ability to provide financial transaction services or accept and process client credit card orders or tax returns. From time to time, we detect, or receive notices from clients or public or private agencies that they have detected, vulnerabilities in our servers, our software or third-party software components that are distributed with our products. The existence of vulnerabilities, even if they do not result in a security breach, may harm client confidence and require substantial resources to address, and we may not be able to discover or remediate such security vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Although we have commercially available network and application security, internal control measures, and physical security procedures to safeguard our systems, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, loss or theft of personal information will not occur, which may harm our business, client reputation and future financial results and may require us to expend significant resources to address these problems, including notification under data privacy regulations.  Security concerns may adversely affect our online financial services that we provide to our clients, and vulnerability of our clients’ computers and mobile devices could lead to losses related to identity theft or other fraud and harm our reputation and financial performance.  We offer a range of services to our clients online, including digital and assisted tax services and banking services provided by HRB Bank. A significant requirement of providing online financial transactions is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. The systems we use rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide secure transmission of confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms used to protect client transaction data. If we, or another provider of financial services through the internet, were to suffer damage from a security breach, public acceptance and use of the internet as a medium for financial transactions could suffer. In addition, our clients may access our online tax services from their computers and mobile devices, install and use our H&R Block At HomeTM tax preparation software on their computers, and access online banking services from their computers and mobile devices. Because our business model relies on our clients’ use of their own personal computers, mobile devices and the internet, computer viruses and other attacks on our clients’ personal computer systems and mobile devices could create losses for our clients even without any breach in the security of our systems, and could thereby harm our business and our reputation. Any security breach could deter potential clients or cause          H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K   9   Table of Contents  existing clients to leave, thereby impairing our ability to grow and maintain profitability and, possibly, our ability to continue delivering our products and services through the internet. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent security breaches, these measures may not be successful.  An interruption in or breach of our information systems, those of a third party on which we rely, or the internet may result in lost business.  We rely heavily upon communications and information systems and the internet to conduct our business. Our systems and operations are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from network failure, hardware failure, software failure, power or telecommunications failures, computer viruses and worms, negative disruptions to the operation of the internet, penetration of our network by hackers or other unauthorized users and natural disasters. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of our information systems, the third-party information systems on which we rely, or the internet could negatively impact our core business operations and increase our risk of loss. As our businesses are seasonal, our systems must be capable of processing high volumes during peak season. Therefore, service interruptions resulting from system or internet failures could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients, which in turn could damage our brand and reputation, or adversely impact our profitability.  We cannot make assurances that system or internet failures, interruptions or breaches will not occur, or if they do occur that we or the third parties on whom we rely will adequately address them. The precautionary measures that we have implemented to avoid systems outages and to minimize the effects of any data or communication systems interruptions may not be adequate, and we may not have anticipated or addressed all of the potential events that could threaten or undermine our information systems. The occurrence of any systems or internet failure, interruption or breach could significantly impair the reputation of our brand, diminish the attractiveness of our services and harm our business.  Government initiatives that simplify tax return preparation or expedite refunds could reduce the need for our services as a third-party tax return preparer, and cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.  Many taxpayers seek assistance from paid tax return preparers such as us not only because of the level of complexity involved in the tax return preparation and filing process, but also because of paid tax return preparers’ ability to expedite refund proceeds under certain circumstances. From time to time, government officials propose measures seeking to simplify the preparation and filing of tax returns or to provide additional assistance with respect to preparing and filing such tax returns or expediting refunds. During tax season 2011, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) introduced a prepaid debit card pilot program designed to facilitate the refund process. HRB Bank also provides this type of service through its H&R Block Prepaid Emerald MasterCard®. Additionally, during tax season 2011, the IRS increased its emphasis on a process to allow taxpayers to allocate their refunds to multiple accounts. The adoption or expansion of any measures that significantly simplify tax return preparation, expedite refunds or otherwise reduce the need for a third-party tax return preparer could reduce demand for our services, and cause our revenues or results of operations to decline.  The Dodd-Frank Act is expected to increase capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies. Compliance with these new capital requirements could adversely affect our Holding Companies and could alter our strategic plans.  The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes to the laws regulating banks, holding companies and financial services firms, and requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations and prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes consolidated capital requirements on SLHCs. These requirements may have a significant long term effect on our Holding Companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to promulgate minimum capital requirements for SLHCs, including leverage (Tier 1) and risk based capital requirements that are no less stringent than those applicable to banks.  On June 7, 2012, the Federal Reserve issued a 250 page notice of proposed rulemaking on increased capital requirements, implementing changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act and portions of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, portions of which would apply to top-tier SLHCs including H&R Block, Inc. We are still analyzing the proposed capital regulations, which would not become fully implemented until January 1, 2015,  and the effect they would have on us and our business.          10   H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K   Table of Contents The proposed capital requirements for SLHCs may require us to retain or raise additional capital, restrict our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock and/or alter our strategic plans. See Item 1 for further discussion of the Dodd-Frank Act.  HRB Bank is subject to extensive federal banking laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable banking laws and regulations, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, damages, penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business.  HRB Bank is subject to regulation, examination, supervision, reporting requirements and enforcement by the OCC. The OCC can, among other things, issue cease-and-desist orders, assess civil money penalties and remove bank directors, officers or employees, for violations of banking laws and regulations or engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices.  HRB Bank is subject to OCC regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may trigger actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on HRB Bank. HRB Bank must meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. OCC regulations require HRB Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of tangible equity, total risk-based capital and Tier 1 capital. On June 7, 2012, the OCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking increasing capital requirements for federal savings banks, including HRB Bank. We are still reviewing how the OCC’s proposed regulations would affect HRB Bank and its business.  The laws and regulations imposed by federal banking regulators generally involve restrictions and requirements in connection with a variety of technical, specialized and expanding matters and concerns. For example, compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements, and the Bank Secrecy Act, has taken on heightened importance with regulators as a result of efforts to limit terrorism. There has been increased regulation with respect to the protection of customer privacy and the need to secure sensitive customer information. Being subject to banking regulation may put us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors which are not subject to such requirements.  The OCC could deem certain products offered by HRB Bank to be “unsafe and unsound” and require HRB Bank to discontinue offering such products. To the extent such products are instrumental in attracting clients to our offices for tax preparation services, we could experience a significant loss of clients should such products be discontinued. This could cause our revenues or profitability to decline.  The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to administer and enforce all federal consumer protections laws. Regulations promulgated by the CFPB may affect our bank and financial services businesses in ways we cannot predict, which may require changes to our financial products, services and contracts.  The Dodd-Frank Act also created the CFPB with broad powers to administer and enforce all federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, federal savings banks, and other financial services companies, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators. HRB Bank does not currently have assets in excess of $10 billion.  The CFPB has extensive rulemaking and enforcement powers that may impact our business operations. Specifically, the CFPB may examine, and take enforcement actions against, our non-bank subsidiaries that provide consumer financial products and services. New CFPB regulations may require changes to our financial products, services and contracts. The potential reach of the CFPB’s broad rulemaking powers and enforcement authority on the operations of banks and financial services companies offering consumer financial products or services, including our bank and financial services subsidiaries, is currently unknown.          H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K   11   Table of Contents The nature of our tax service and product offerings requires timely product launches. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings may harm our revenue, results of operations and reputation.  Tax laws and tax forms are subject to change each year, and the nature and timing of any such changes are unpredictable. As a part of our business, we must incorporate any changes to tax laws and tax forms into our tax service and product offerings, including our online tax services and our H&R Block At HomeTM tax preparation software. The unpredictable nature of changes to tax laws and tax forms can result in condensed development cycles for our tax service and product offerings because our clients expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of such offerings to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline. Any changes in governmental regulations and processes that affect how we provide services to our clients may require us to make corresponding changes to our client service systems and procedures.  If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our services and products late in our development cycle it may cause us to delay the launch dates of our offerings. Any major defects or launch delays may lead to loss of clients and revenue, negative publicity, client and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, and increased operating expenses.  Our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire, train and retain sufficient qualified seasonal tax personnel.  Due to the seasonality of our tax business, we employ a substantial amount of seasonal tax professionals on an annual basis. If we were unable to hire, train and retain a sufficient amount of seasonal tax professionals, it could negatively impact our ability to serve clients, which in turn could damage our brand and reputation, or adversely impact our profitability.  We face substantial litigation in connection with our various business activities, and such litigation may damage our reputation or result in material liabilities and losses.  We, and/or our subsidiaries, have been named and from time to time will likely continue to be named, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our various business activities. Adverse outcomes related to litigation could result in substantial damages and could cause our earnings to decline. Negative public opinion could also result from our subsidiaries’ actual or alleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation, which in turn could adversely affect our business prospects and cause the market price of our stock to decline. In addition, certain regulators have alleged that some of our competitors are lending tax preparation fees when they issue products similar to a RAC to their clients. An adverse ruling in this area could have a material impact on our offering of RACs, which could result in the loss of a significant number of clients, causing our revenues or results of operations to decline. See Item 8, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  Our access to liquidity may be negatively impacted as disruptions in credit markets occur, if credit rating downgrades occur or if we fail to meet certain covenants. Funding costs may increase, leading to reduced earnings.  We need liquidity to meet our off-season working capital requirements, to service debt obligations including refinancing of maturing obligations, and for other related activities. Our access to and the cost of liquidity could be negatively impacted in the event of credit rating downgrades or if we fail to meet existing debt covenants. In addition, events could occur which could increase our need for liquidity above current levels.  If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, the cost of debt would likely increase and capital market access could decrease or become unavailable. Our unsecured committed line of credit (CLOC) is subject to various covenants, and a violation of a covenant could impair our access to liquidity currently available through the CLOC. If current sources of liquidity were to become unavailable, we would need to obtain additional sources of funding, which may not be possible or may be available under less favorable terms.  Our businesses may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions, particularly if unemployment levels do not improve or continue to increase.  Difficult economic conditions are frequently characterized by high unemployment levels and declining consumer and business spending. These poor economic conditions may negatively affect demand and pricing for our services. Higher unemployment levels, especially within client segments we serve, may result in clients no longer being required to file tax returns, electing not to file tax returns, or clients seeking lower cost          12   H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K   Table of Contents  preparation and filing alternatives. Continued high unemployment levels may negatively impact our ability to increase or retain tax preparation clients.  Economic conditions that negatively affect housing prices and the job market may result in deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolio primarily held by HRB Bank, and such deterioration could have a negative impact on our business and profitability.  The overall credit quality of mortgage loans held for investment is impacted by the strength of the U.S. economy and local economic conditions, including residential housing prices. Economic trends that negatively affect housing prices and the job market could result in deterioration in credit quality of our mortgage loan portfolio and a decline in the value of associated collateral. Future interest rate resets could also lead to increased delinquencies in our mortgage loans held for investment. Trends in the residential mortgage loan market continue to reflect high loan delinquencies and lower collateral values. We recorded loan loss provisions totaling $24.1 million, $35.6 million and $47.8 million during fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  HRB Bank’s loan portfolio is concentrated in the states of Florida, New York and California, which represented 19%, 18% and 13%, respectively, of HRB Bank’s total mortgage loans held for investment at April 30, 2012. No other state held more than 10% of HRB Bank’s loan balances. If adverse trends in the residential mortgage loan market continue, particularly in geographic areas in which HRB Bank owns a greater concentration of mortgage loans, HRB Bank could incur additional significant loan loss provisions.  Mortgage loans purchased from Sand Canyon Corporation, previously known as Option One Mortgage Corporation (including its subsidiaries, collectively, SCC) represent 59% of total loans held for investment at April 30, 2012. These loans have experienced higher delinquency rates than other loans in HRB Bank’s portfolio, and may expose HRB Bank to greater risk of credit loss.  In addition to mortgage loans, we also extend secured and unsecured credit to other clients, including providing EAs to our tax clients. We may incur significant losses on credit we extend, which in turn could reduce our profitability.  RISKS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  SCC is subject to potential contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, SCC has accrued an estimated liability related to these contingent losses that may not be adequate.  SCC remains exposed to losses relating to mortgage loans it previously originated. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole-loans to single third-party buyers or in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs).  In connection with the sale of loans and/or RMBSs, SCC made certain representations and warranties. These representations and warranties varied based on the nature of the transaction and the buyer’s or insurer’s requirements, but generally pertained to the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, borrower fraud, the loan’s compliance with the criteria for inclusion in the transaction, including compliance with SCC’s underwriting standards or loan criteria established by the buyer, ability to deliver required documentation, and compliance with applicable laws. In the event there is deemed to be a breach of a representation and warranty and such breach materially and adversely affects the value of a mortgage loan, or a securitization insurer’s interest or a certificate holder’s interest in the mortgage loan, SCC may be obligated to repurchase the loan or may otherwise indemnify certain parties for losses, referred to as “representation and warranty claims.” The statute of limitations for a contractual claim to enforce a representation and warranty obligation is generally six years or such shorter limitations period that may apply under the law of a state where the economic injury occurred. SCC believes that the limitations period begins to run from the applicable closing date of the sale of the loans or RMBS, although there is limited case law on this issue.  SCC accrues a liability for contingent losses relating to representation and warranty claims by estimating probable losses for those claims, both known and projected. At April 30, 2012, SCC’s accrued liability for representation and warranty claims was $130.0 million. SCC’s accrued liability is subjective and based upon, among other things, SCC’s historical and projected frequency of representation and warranty claims. Losses incurred in connection with actual or projected representation and warranty claims may be in excess of the accrued liability. The accrued liability may need to be increased in the future for additional losses associated with representation and warranty claims. If losses related to future representation and warranty claims are in excess of SCC’s accrued liability, those losses could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial          H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K   13   Table of Contents  condition and results of operations. The accrued liability for representation and warranty claims does not include any losses related to litigation matters discussed in the risk factor below and in Item 8, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Also see Item 8, note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.  SCC is subject to potential contingent losses related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated as a depositor or loan originator, which may result in significant financial losses.  Between January 2005 and November 2007, SCC participated in approximately 110 securitization transactions either as a depositor or a loan originator. In most of these securitization transactions, SCC agreed, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to indemnify the underwriters or depositors for certain losses and expenses that the underwriters or depositors may incur as a result of certain claims made against them relating to loans originated by SCC, including certain legal expenses the underwriters or depositors incur in their defense of such claims. Some of those underwriters and depositors are defendants in lawsuits where various other parties allege a variety of claims, including violations of federal and state securities law and common law fraud based on alleged materially inaccurate or misleading disclosures, arising out of the activities of such underwriters or depositors in their sale of RMBSs or mortgage loans. As of April 30, 2012, SCC has received notice of a claim for indemnification from the underwriters or depositors relating to 9 of these lawsuits and involving approximately 25 securitization transactions collateralized in whole or in part by loans originated by SCC. Additional notices of claims for indemnification may be received by SCC in the future from underwriters or depositors who are subject to existing or new litigation.  In addition, other counterparties to the securitization transactions, including certificate holders, securitization trustees and monoline insurance companies, have filed or may file lawsuits, or may assert indemnification claims, directly against depositors and loan originators in securitization transactions alleging a variety of claims, including federal and state securities law violations, common law torts and fraud and breach of contract, among others. Additional or new lawsuits may be filed against SCC in the future.  These matters are in the early stages and SCC is not able to reasonably estimate the associated amount of any possible loss or range of loss. As a result, we have not accrued any liability related to these exposures. However, if SCC were required to pay material amounts with respect to these matters, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as SCC’s financial condition and operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements. See Item 8, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  H&R Block has guaranteed the payment of certain limited claims against SCC.  SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims by counterparties to SCC whole loan sales and securitization transactions, including certificate holders, securitization trustees and monoline insurance companies. In certain limited circumstances described below, H&R Block has outstanding guarantees of payment if claims are successfully asserted by such counterparties.  These guarantees include representation and warranty claims with respect to three whole loan sales in 2007 by SCC with an aggregate outstanding principal and liquidated amount of approximately $1.4 billion as of April 30, 2012. There have been a total of $29.3 million of representation and warranty claims with respect to these three whole loan sales, of which $4.4 million were deemed valid and paid by SCC, representing significantly less than one percent of the original principal amount of such loans.  These guarantees also cover payment of representation and warranty claims with respect to mortgage loans supporting RMBSs with a remaining outstanding principal amount of approximately $1.2 billion that were issued prior to 2005 (“Pre-2005 RMBSs”). We do not anticipate that any significant amount of representation and warranty claims will be asserted with respect to the Pre-2005 RMBSs in view of (i) the underlying loan vintage and performance, (ii) principal losses to certificate holders represent significantly less than one percent of the original aggregate principal amount of Pre-2005 RMBSs, (iii) no claims have been asserted since 2008, and (iv) based upon our belief regarding the applicable statute of limitations we do not expect that new representation and warranty claims would be viable. This claims history is consistent with our experience that most valid claims relate to loan delinquencies occurring within the first two years following origination, and that the longer a loan performs prior to an event of default, the less likely a default will be related to a breach of a representation and warranty.  These guarantees also cover limited representation and warranty claims on other outstanding securitization transactions, with a potential claims exposure of less than $200 million. In addition, as is customary in divestiture transactions, H&R Block guaranteed the payment of any indemnification claims from the purchaser of SCC’s servicing business, including claims relating to pre-closing services (which closing occurred in 2008).          14   H&R BLOCK 2012 Form 10K   Table of Contents If SCC were to become insolvent, we could be subject to claims by the unpaid creditors of SCC.  As discussed above, SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims and other claims and litigation related to its past sales and securitizations of mortgage loans. It is likely that additional claims and proceedings will be made in the future. If the amount that SCC is ultimately required to pay with respect to these claims and litigation exceeds its assets, the creditors of SCC, or a bankruptcy trustee if SCC were to file or be forced into bankruptcy, may attempt to assert claims against us for payment of SCC’s obligations. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments; however, if this position is challenged and not upheld, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, in certain limited instances, H&R Block guaranteed amounts as outlined in the above risk factor.          ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
