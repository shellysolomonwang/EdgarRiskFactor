Item 1A.  Risk Factors  Navient employs a Risk Appetite Framework which defines the most significant risks impacting our business and provides a process for evaluating and quantifying such risks. Our Enterprise Risk Committee monitors approved risk limits and thresholds to ensure our businesses are operating within approved risk parameters. Through ongoing monitoring of risk exposures, management endeavors to identify potential risks and develop appropriate responses and mitigation strategies. Our Risk Appetite Framework segments Navient’s risks across nine domains: (1) credit; (2) market; (3) funding and liquidity; (4) compliance; (5) legal; (6) operational; (7) reputational/political; (8) governance; and (9) strategy. The risk factors enumerated in this section are presented in a manner that is consistent with our overall risk framework.  11    These are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions or results of operations in future periods. In addition, our reaction to material future developments as well as our competitors’ and regulators’ reactions to these developments will affect our future results.   In addition to the other information set forth in this report including any forward-looking statements, you should carefully consider the following factors because these factors could cause our business, actual results of operations or financial condition to be materially different from our historic results or from our anticipated results of operations, cash flows or financial condition for future periods.  CREDIT RISK. Credit risk is the risk to earnings or capital resulting from an obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract with us or otherwise fail to perform as agreed. Credit risk is found in all activities where success depends on counterparty, issuer or borrower performance.  Economic conditions and the creditworthiness of third parties could have a material adverse effect on Navient’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  We anticipate that, for a period of time, Navient’s earnings will be largely dependent on the expected future creditworthiness of its education loan customers, especially with respect to its Private Education Loan portfolio. Our research consistently indicates that borrower unemployment rates and the failure of in-school borrowers to graduate or otherwise complete their education are two of the most significant macroeconomic factors that increase loan delinquencies and defaults. Additionally, modifications to the original repayment terms in the form of loan forbearance, deferment, grace periods and the use of payment modification programs, including income-based repayment programs can individually and cumulatively impact the performance of the Company’s FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan portfolios. Modifications to private loans may lower the potential return on investment and may have the related effect of delaying defaults which would otherwise have become apparent in the performance of our portfolios. Therefore, deterioration in the economy could adversely affect the credit quality of our borrowers requiring more frequent use of these loan modification tools. Higher credit-related losses and weaker credit quality could negatively affect Navient’s business, financial condition and results of operations and limit its funding options, including Navient’s access to the capital markets, which could also adversely impact its liquidity position.  Defaults on education loans held by Navient, particularly Private Education Loans, could adversely affect Navient’s earnings.  FFELP Loans are insured or guaranteed by state or not-for-profit agencies and are also protected by contractual rights to recovery from the United States pursuant to guaranty agreements among ED and these agencies. These guarantees generally cover at least 97 percent of a FFELP Loan’s principal and accrued interest and, in limited circumstances, 100 percent of the loan’s principal and accrued interest. Nevertheless, Navient is exposed to credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the FFELP Loans in its portfolio. Under certain circumstances, if we fail to service FFELP Loans in compliance with HEA regulations that relate to our ongoing communications with borrowers and default aversion requirements, we may jeopardize the insurance, guarantees and federal support we receive on these loans. A small percentage of our FFELP Loan portfolio has become permanently uninsured as a result of these regulations and we anticipate this will continue to a limited extent in the future. Under such circumstances, Navient bears the full credit exposure on such previously insured loans.  Navient bears the full credit exposure on all its Private Education Loans. Navient believes that delinquencies are an important indicator of the potential future credit performance for Private Education Loans. Navient’s delinquencies as a percentage of Private Education Loans in repayment were 5.8 percent at December 31, 2017. For a complete discussion of Navient’s loan delinquencies, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Private Education Loan Portfolio Performance.”  The evaluation of Navient’s allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective and it requires estimates that may be subject to significant changes. Additionally, GAAP accounting rules can require us to determine allowances for loan losses differently based upon the manner in which we acquired the applicable loan assets. For additional information on our allowance for loan losses, please refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Allowance for Loan Losses.” Future defaults could be higher than anticipated due to a variety of factors outside of Navient’s control, such as downturns in the economy, regulatory or operational changes and other unforeseen future trends. According to Company-sponsored independent research, young adults who stopped attending college before earning a degree or certificate are among those most likely to have trouble making payments. Losses on Private Education Loans are also impacted by various risk characteristics that may be specific to individual loans. Loan status (in-school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), loan seasoning (number of months in which a payment has been made by a customer), underwriting criteria (e.g., credit scores), existence of a cosigner are all factors that can impact the likelihood of default. The type of school may also play a significant role in loan performance. Additionally, general economic and employment conditions, including employment rates for recent college graduates can have a significant impact on loan delinquency and default rates. If actual loan performance is worse than currently  12    estimated, it could materially affect Navient’s estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses in Navient’s statements of income and as a result adversely affect Navient’s results of operations.  The FASB has recently issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments – Credit Losses," which replaces the current "incurred loss" model for recognizing credit losses with an "expected loss" model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as our loans held for investment, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the "incurred loss" model required under current GAAP, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance, which would reduce shareholders’ equity and capital. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The new CECL standard will become effective for us on January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our allowance for loan losses, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which we adopt the new standard. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations. Our recent acquisition of Earnest and our other private education refinance products expose us to credit underwriting risks based upon the credit model we use to forecast loss rates. If we are unable to effectively forecast loss rates, it can materially adversely affect our operating results. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we acquired Earnest, a leading financial technology and education finance company. Navient underwrites Private Education Loans for our Earnest subsidiary and for similarly originated loans based upon our analysis of extensive credit criteria. Criteria reviewed in underwriting Private Education Loans may include any or all of the following: (i) verified employment or offer of employment, income and assets, which is generally verified through connected accounts; (ii) career experience, stability of employment, and specialization; (iii) qualifying credit history, taking into account credit score; (iv) debt to income ratio; (v) demonstrated ability to pay through free cash flow calculations; (vi) graduation from an eligible post-secondary school; (vii) verified savings in the form of retirement and non-retirement assets; and (viii) individual data points gathered from accounts connected in the application process, such as late fees, overdraft fees, and credit card interest. We define free cash flow generally as after-tax monthly income of a borrower minus the sum of rent or mortgage payments, student loan payments and any other fixed expenses of such borrower. We do not rely on any single factor in making our underwriting decisions. Each of the above factors are reviewed and weighted depending on the individual borrower’s circumstances at the time the underwriting decision is made. For example, a greater weight may be given to the post-secondary school(s) of a borrower when such borrower is a recent graduate and less weight given to such borrower’s limited employment history or savings. Conversely, in the circumstances where several years have passed since a borrower has graduated from a post-secondary school, less weight may be given to such borrower’s school and greater emphasis may be placed on the borrower’s employment history, credit history and savings. Navient’s proprietary underwriting process weighs these various factors based on the borrower’s overall credit and personal circumstances.   MARKET, FUNDING & LIQUIDITY RISK. Market risk is the risk to earnings or capital resulting from changes in market conditions. Navient is exposed to various types of market risk, in particular the risk of loss resulting in a mismatch between the maturity/duration of assets and liabilities, interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks that arise through the management of our investment, debt and education loan portfolios. Funding and liquidity risk is the risk to earnings, capital or the conduct of our business arising from the inability to meet our obligations when they become due, such as the ability to access the unsecured or asset backed securities credit markets to fund liability maturities or invest in future asset growth and business operations at reasonable market rates.  Navient’s business is affected by the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets.  The capital markets have from time to time experienced periods of significant volatility. This volatility can dramatically and adversely affect financing costs when compared to historical norms or make funding unavailable at any costs. Additional factors that  13    could make financing more expensive or unavailable to Navient include, but are not limited to, financial losses, events that have an adverse impact on Navient’s reputation, changes in the activities of Navient’s business partners, events that have an adverse impact on the financial services industry generally, counterparty availability, negative credit rating actions with respect to Navient, asset-backed securities sponsored by Navient or the U.S. federal government, changes affecting Navient’s assets, the ability of existing or future Navient-sponsored securitization trusts to hedge interest rate and currency risk, corporate and regulatory actions, absolute and comparative interest rate changes, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory and tax environments governing funding transactions, including existing or future securitization and derivatives transactions. If financing is difficult, expensive or unavailable, Navient’s results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  Higher or lower than expected prepayments of loans could change the expected net interest income the Company receives as the holder of the Residual Interests of securitization trusts holding education loans or cause the bonds issued by the securitization trust to be paid at a different speed than originally anticipated. These factors could materially alter our net interest margin or the value of our Residual Interests.  The rate at which borrowers prepay their loans can have a material impact on our net interest margin or the value of our Residual Interests. Prepayment rates and levels are subject to a variety of economic, social, competitive and other factors, including changes in interest rates, availability of alternative financings, regulatory changes affecting the education loan market and the general economy.  FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans may be voluntarily prepaid without penalty by the borrower or consolidated with the borrower’s other education loans through refinancing.  FFELP Loans may also be repaid after default by the Guarantors of FFELP Loans. Conversely, borrowers might not choose to prepay their education loans or the terms of the education loans may be extended as a result of grace periods, deferment periods, income-driven repayment plans or other repayment terms or monthly payment amount modifications agreed to by the servicer, for example. FFELP Loan borrowers may be eligible for various existing income-based repayment programs under which borrowers can qualify for reduced or zero monthly payment or even debt forgiveness after a certain number of years of repayment.  Future initiatives by ED or by Congress to encourage or force consolidation, create additional income-based repayment or debt forgiveness programs or establish other policies and programs that influence the rate at which borrowers repay their loans, could also affect prepayments on education loans. Additionally, recent entrants into the student loan refinancing market may increase borrower prepayments. These companies specialize in consolidating and refinancing student loans and may have certain advantages including lower cost structures, fewer regulatory constraints and the ability to be highly selective in choosing borrowers who are eligible to refinance. We acquired Earnest in 2017 to participate in this refinancing market and to appeal to “digitally native” borrowers with higher incomes, high credit scores or other favorable credit determinants. We cannot be certain that our acquisition of Earnest or similar acquisitions will reduce the rate at which borrowers prepay their loans.  While we anticipate some variability in prepayment levels, extraordinary or extended increases or decreases in prepayment rates could materially affect our liquidity, interest income, net interest margin and the value of our Residual Interests. Additionally, a prolonged introduction of significant amounts of subsidized funding into the Private Education Loan market at below market interest rates — whether from Federal or private sources —could increase the prepayment rates of our existing Private Education Loans and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. When, as a result of unanticipated prepayment levels, education loans within a securitization trust amortize faster than originally contracted, the trust’s pool balance may decline at a rate faster than the prepayment rate assumed when the trust’s bonds were originally issued. If the trust’s pool balance declines faster than originally anticipated, in most of our securitization structures, the bonds issued by that trust will also be repaid faster than originally anticipated. In such cases, the Company’s net interest income may decrease and the value of any retained Residual Interest in the trust may similarly decline.  Conversely, when education loans within a securitization trust amortize more slowly than originally contracted, the trust’s pool balance may decline more slowly than the prepayment rate assumed when the trust’s bonds were originally issued and the bonds may be repaid more slowly than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company’s net interest income increases and the value of any retained Residual Interest in the trust may increase. In addition, if the prepayment rate is especially slow and certain rights of the sellers or the servicer are not exercised or are insufficient or other action is not taken to counter the slower prepayment rate, the trust’s bonds may not be repaid by their legal final maturity date(s), which could result in an event of default under the underlying securitization agreements. Beginning in 2016, Moody’s and Fitch took final ratings actions on our non-recourse FFELP ABS sponsored by our affiliates due to concerns that trust cash flows may not be sufficient to pay all bonds by the legal final maturity date. For a discussion of the rating agencies actions and the Company’s efforts to mitigate the “legal final maturity” risk, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Funding and Liquidity Risk Management.”  14    Finally, rating agencies may place bonds on watch or change their ratings on (or their ratings methodology for) the bonds issued by a securitization trust, possibly raising or lowering their ratings, based upon these prepayment rates and their perception of the risk posed by those rates to the timing of the trust cash flows. Placing bonds on watch, or changing ratings negatively or proposing or making changes to ratings methodology could: (i) affect our liquidity; (ii) impede our access to the securitization markets; (iii) require changes to our securitization structures; (iv) impact our net interest margins; and/or (v) raise or lower the value of our Residual Interests of our future securitization transactions.  High or increasing interest rate environments may cause Navient’s Floor Income to decline, which may adversely affect its earnings.  FFELP Loans disbursed before April 1, 2006 generally earn interest at the higher of either the borrower rate, which is fixed over a period of time, or a floating rate based on a Special Allowance Payment or SAP formula set by ED. Navient has generally financed its FFELP Loans with floating rate debt whose interest is matched closely to the floating nature of the applicable SAP formula. Historically, these loans have been indexed to either the Treasury bill, commercial paper or one-month LIBOR rates. If a decline in interest rates causes the borrower rate to exceed the SAP formula rate, Navient will continue to earn interest on the loan at the fixed borrower rate while the floating rate interest on Navient debt will continue to decline. The additional spread earned between the fixed borrower rate and the SAP formula rate is referred to as “Floor Income.” The replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate may have a further detrimental impact on our LIBOR-indexed debt if rates suddenly rise as new market borrowing activity transfers to other benchmark rates. Depending on the type of FFELP Loan and when it was originated, the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to a market rate on July 1 of each year. For loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term, Navient may earn Floor Income for an extended period of time; for those loans where the borrower interest rate is reset annually on July 1, Navient may earn Floor Income to the next reset date. In accordance with legislation enacted in 2006, holders of FFELP Loans are required to rebate Floor Income to ED for all FFELP Loans disbursed on or after April 1, 2006.  Floor Income can be volatile as rates on the underlying education loans move up and down. Subject to prevailing market conditions, Navient generally hedges this risk by using derivatives in an effort to lock in a portion of our Floor Income over the term of the contract. A rise in interest rates will reduce the amount of Floor Income received on the FFELP Loans not presently hedged with derivatives, which will compress Navient’s net interest margins. Additionally, net interest margins can be negatively impacted by unusual variances between one-month and three-month LIBOR.  Navient’s credit ratings are important to its liquidity. A reduction in its credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity, increase its borrowing costs or limit its access to the capital markets.  As of December 31, 2017, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch rated Navient’s long term unsecured debt below investment grade. In addition, the capital markets for sub-investment grade companies are not as liquid as those involving investment grade entities. These factors have resulted in a higher cost of funds for the Company, and has caused our senior unsecured debt to trade with greater volatility.  Navient’s unsecured debt totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2017, and Navient utilizes the unsecured debt markets to help fund its business and refinance outstanding debt. The amount, type and cost of its funding directly affects the cost of operating its business and growing its assets and is dependent upon outside factors, including its credit rating from rating agencies. There can be no assurance that the Company’s credit ratings will not be reduced further. A reduction in the credit ratings of the Company’s senior unsecured debt could adversely affect Navient’s liquidity, increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets and place incremental pressure on its net interest income.  Adverse market conditions or an inability to effectively manage its liquidity risk could negatively impact Navient’s ability to meet its liquidity and funding needs, which could materially and adversely impact its results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.  Navient must effectively manage its liquidity risk. Navient requires liquidity to meet cash requirements such as day-to-day operating expenses, required payments of principal and interest on borrowings, and distributions to stockholders. As of December 31, 2017, a total of $5.7 billion of our unsecured debt will mature before the year-end of 2020. We expect to fund our ongoing liquidity needs, including the repayment of $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature in 2018, primarily through our current cash, investments and unencumbered FFELP Loan portfolio, the predictable operating cash flows provided by operating activities ($1.2 billion in the year ended December 31, 2017), the repayment of principal on unencumbered education loan assets, and the distribution of overcollateralization from our securitization trusts. We may also draw down on our secured FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan facilities, issue term ABS, enter into additional repurchase facilities called “Private Education Loan ABS Repurchase Facilities” to finance the Residual Interests in existing Private Education Loan ABS trusts or issue additional unsecured debt. Navient  15    may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly, or may be too illiquid, which could result in financial distress during times of financial stress or capital market disruptions.  The interest rate characteristics of Navient’s earning assets do not always match the interest rate characteristics of its funding arrangements, which may increase the price of, or decrease Navient’s ability to obtain, necessary liquidity.  Net interest income will be the primary source of cash flow generated by Navient’s portfolios of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans. At the present, interest earned on FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans is primarily indexed to one-month LIBOR and either one-month LIBOR or the one-month Prime rate, respectively, but Navient’s debt is primarily indexed to rates other than one-month LIBOR and Prime.  The different interest rate characteristics of Navient’s loan portfolios and the liabilities funding these loan portfolios result in basis risk and repricing risk. It is not economically feasible to hedge all of Navient’s exposure to such risks. While the asset and hedge indices are short-term with rate movements that are typically highly correlated, there can be no assurance that the historically high correlation will not be disrupted by capital market dislocations or other factors not within our control. For example, during the second half of 2016, Navient experienced widening spreads between one-month and three-month LIBOR and the cost of hedging this variance was prohibitive. We cannot provide any assurance that such a situation will not reoccur which will reduce our net interest margins and net income. In these circumstances, Navient’s earnings could be materially adversely affected.  Navient’s use of derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign currency sensitivity exposes it to credit and market risk that could have a material adverse effect on its earnings and liquidity.  Navient strives to maintain an overall strategy that uses derivatives to minimize the economic effect of interest rate and/or foreign currency changes. However, developing an effective strategy for dealing with these movements is complex, and no strategy can completely avoid the risks associated with these fluctuations. For example, Navient’s education loan portfolio is subject to prepayment risk that could result in its being under- or over-hedged, which could result in material losses. In addition, Navient’s use of derivatives in its risk management activities could expose it to mark-to-market losses if interest rates or foreign currencies move in a materially different way than was expected when Navient entered into the related derivative contracts. As a result, there can be no assurance that hedging activities using derivatives will effectively manage Navient’s interest rate or foreign currency sensitivity, have the desired beneficial impact on its results of operations or financial condition or not adversely impact its liquidity and earnings.  Navient’s use of derivatives also exposes it to market risk and credit risk. Market risk is the chance of financial loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market liquidity. For example, during 2016, Navient’s net interest margin was negatively impacted by unusually wide variances between one-month and three-month LIBOR. Navient’s Floor Income Contracts and some of the basis swaps it uses to manage earnings variability caused by different reset characteristics on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value, called the “mark-to-market,” of these derivative instruments is included in Navient’s statement of income without a corresponding mark-to-market of the economically hedged item. A decline in the fair value of these derivatives could have a material adverse effect on Navient’s reported earnings.  Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under a contract. Credit risk is limited to the loss of the fair value gain in a derivative that the counterparty or clearinghouse owes or will owe in the future to Navient. If a counterparty or clearinghouse fails to perform its obligations, Navient could, depending on the type of counterparty arrangement, experience a loss of liquidity or an economic loss. In addition, Navient might not be able to cost effectively replace the derivative position depending on the type of derivative and the current economic environment.  Navient’s securitization trusts, which it consolidates on its balance sheet, had $6.7 billion of Euro and British Pound Sterling denominated bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2017. To convert these non-U.S. dollar denominated bonds into U.S. dollar liabilities, the trusts have entered into foreign-currency swaps with highly rated counterparties. A failure by a swap counterparty to perform its obligations could, if the swap has a positive fair value to Navient, materially and adversely affect Navient’s earnings.   16    REGULATORY, COMPLIANCE & LEGAL RISK. Compliance risk is the risk to earnings or capital or reputation arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures, or ethical standards. Legal risk is the risk to earnings, capital or reputation manifested by claims made through the legal system and may arise from a product or service, a transaction, a business relationship, property (real, personal or intellectual), conduct of an employee or change in law or regulation.  Navient’s businesses are subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, regulations and government policies that may change in significant ways and changes to such laws and regulations or changes in existing regulatory guidance or their interpretation or enforcement could materially adversely impact Navient’s business and results of operations. Our businesses are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, rules, regulations and policies. There can be no assurance that these laws, rules, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that will require us to modify our business models or objectives or in ways that affect our returns on investment by restricting existing activities or services, change how our companies operate or the characteristics of our assets, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright.  In particular, the CFPB has authority with respect to Navient’s loan servicing business. It has authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to directly or indirectly enforce those laws and examine Navient for compliance. The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority with respect to various federal consumer financial laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services, including Navient. In July 2016, the CFPB proposed new rules that would, among other things, impose strict limitations on the frequency with which we are permitted to contact borrowers. The cumulative impact of these proposed regulations, if implemented, could have a material effect on our asset recoveries and may result in significant capital expenditures to develop systems that enable us to comply with the new regulations.  The CFPB is authorized to impose monetary penalties, collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. The review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the CFPB. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain, but it has resulted in, and could continue to result in, changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties.  In addition, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that Navient has violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on Navient or its business. Since the CFPB filed its action against the Company in January of 2017, the attorneys general of Illinois, Washington and Pennsylvania have filed separate actions alleging various violations of state and federal consumer protection laws. Loans serviced under the FFELP are subject to the HEA and related laws, rules, regulations and policies. Navient’s servicing operations are designed and monitored to comply with the HEA, related regulations and program guidance; however, ED could determine that Navient is not in compliance for a variety of reasons, including that it misinterpreted ED guidance or incorrectly applied the HEA and its related laws, rules, regulations and policies. Failure to comply could result in fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on affected FFELP Loans, expenses required to cure servicing deficiencies, suspension or termination of its right to participate as a FFELP servicer, negative publicity and potential legal claims. The imposition of significant fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on a material number of FFELP Loans, the incurrence of additional expenses and/or the loss of its ability to participate as a FFELP servicer could individually or in the aggregate have a material, negative impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations. From time to time, legislation is also considered that could affect the treatment of our loan assets in bankruptcy. In addition to CFPB regulation, Navient’s asset recovery business is also subject to regulation and oversight by various state and federal agencies, particularly in the area of consumer protection, and is subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations.  Imposition of new laws, rules or regulations or the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, including litigation costs, and/or business sanctions including but not limited to termination or non-renewal of contracts.  Expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of Navient’s businesses will increase its costs and risks.  Navient’s businesses and operations are increasingly subject to governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny, both at the federal and state levels. Navient is now, and may be subject in the future, to inquiries and audits from state and federal regulators as well as litigation from private plaintiffs. In recent years, Navient has entered into consent orders and other settlements with the FDIC,  17    the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and other banking and state regulators. Navient has paid fines and penalties or provided monetary and other relief in connection with many of these actions and settlements. We have also enhanced our procedures and controls, expanded the risk and control functions within each line of business, invested in technology and hired additional risk, control and compliance personnel.  If Navient fails to successfully address the requirements of the Consent Orders or other settlements it is currently subject, or more generally to effectively enhance its risk and control procedures and processes to meet the heightened expectations of its regulators and other government agencies, it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses, which could adversely affect its operations and, in turn, its financial results.  Navient expects heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions to continue for it and for the financial services industry as a whole. Navient anticipates that regulators will continue to take formal enforcement action, rather than taking informal supervisory actions, more frequently than they have done historically. Such actions can have significant consequences for a financial institution such as Navient, including loss of customers and business and the inability to operate certain businesses.  Due to the uncertainty engendered by these new regulations, guidance and actions, coupled with the likelihood of additional changes or additions to the local, state and federal statutes, regulations and practices applicable to its business, Navient is not able to estimate the ultimate impact of changes in law on its financial results, business operations or strategies. Navient believes that the cost of responding to and complying with these evolving laws and regulations, as well as any guidance from enforcement actions, will continue to increase, as will the risk of penalties and fines from any enforcement actions that may be imposed on its businesses. Navient’s profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result.  Navient’s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating the risk of loss.  Navient’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and returns. Navient has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, control and report the types of risk to which it is subject. Navient seeks to monitor and control risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures, limits and reporting requirements. Management of risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. If the models that Navient uses to mitigate these risks are inadequate, it may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that Navient has not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If Navient’s risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate risks, Navient could suffer unexpected losses, and its results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  We are subject to various legal proceedings and some of these legal proceedings or other contingencies may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results from operations.  We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings in virtually every part of our businesses including the legal proceedings described in the Legal Proceedings section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have adopted appropriate legal and risk management and compliance programs, the diverse nature of our operations, including operations of business we have recently acquired, means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, will arise from time to time. Some of these legal proceedings or other contingencies may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results from operations.  Navient is subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities that may affect its results of operations.  Navient is subject to evolving and complex federal and state tax laws. Significant judgment is required for determining Navient’s tax liabilities. Navient’s tax returns continue to be periodically examined by various tax authorities. Navient has, among other tax liabilities, risks for future tax contingencies arising from operations post-Spin-Off. Due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations post-Spin-Off may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued.  In addition, Navient may be impacted by changes in tax laws, including tax rate changes, changes to the laws related to the treatment and remittance of foreign earnings, new tax laws and subsequent interpretations of tax laws by federal and state tax authorities.  18    Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of Navient’s consolidated financial statements could adversely affect Navient’s reported assets, liabilities, income, revenue or expenses.  The preparation of Navient’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenue or expenses during the reporting periods. Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management could adversely affect Navient’s reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If Navient makes incorrect assumptions or estimates, it may under- or overstate reported financial results, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.  OPERATIONAL RISKS. Operational risk relates to risks arising from systems, process, people and external events that affect the operation of our business, it includes information management, data protection and cybersecurity, business disruption and other risks including human resources.  If Navient does not effectively and continually align its cost structure with its business operations, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Navient continually needs to align its cost structure with its business operations. Navient’s ability to properly size its cost structure is dependent upon a number of variables, including its ability to successfully execute on its business plans and growth initiatives and future legislative or regulatory changes. If Navient undertakes cost reductions based on its business plan, those reductions could be too dramatic and could cause disruptions in its business, reductions in the quality of the services it provides or cause it to fail to comply with applicable regulatory standards. Alternatively, Navient may fail to implement, or be unable to achieve, necessary cost savings commensurate with its business and prospects. In either case, Navient’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  A failure of the operating systems or infrastructure of Navient could disrupt its business, cause significant losses, result in regulatory action or damage its reputation.  A failure of Navient’s operating systems or infrastructure could disrupt our business. Navient’s business is dependent on its ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with contractual, legal and regulatory standards and its own product specifications, both currently and in the future. As Navient’s processing demands and loan portfolios change, both in volume and in terms and conditions, Navient’s ability to develop and maintain its operating systems and infrastructure may become increasingly challenging. There is no assurance that Navient has adequately or efficiently developed, maintained or acquired such systems and infrastructure or will do so in the future.  The servicing, financial, accounting, data processing and other operating systems and facilities that support Navient’s business may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are beyond Navient’s control, adversely affecting its ability to timely process transactions. Any such failure could adversely affect Navient’s ability to service its clients, and result in financial loss or liability to its clients, disrupt its business, and result in regulatory action or cause reputational damage.  Despite the plans and facilities Navient has in place, its ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its business. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, Internet, transportation or other services used by Navient or third parties with which it conducts business. Notwithstanding efforts to maintain business continuity, a disruptive event impacting Navient’s processing locations could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.  Navient depends on secure information technology, and a breach of its information technology systems could result in significant losses, disclosure of confidential customer information and reputational damage, which would adversely affect Navient’s business.  Navient’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal, confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Although Navient takes protective measures it deems reasonable and appropriate, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, malicious attacks and other events that could have a security impact beyond Navient’s control. These technologies, systems and networks, and those of third parties, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Navient’s or its customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt Navient’s business operations or those of its customers or other third parties. Information security risks for institutions that handle large numbers of financial transactions on a daily basis such as Navient have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties.  If one or more of such events occur, personal, confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, Navient’s computer systems and networks could be jeopardized or could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Navient’s operations that could result in significant losses or reputational damage. Navient routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential and proprietary information, some of it through third parties. Navient maintains secure transmission capability and works  19    to ensure that third parties follow similar procedures. Nevertheless, an interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. In the event personal, confidential or other information is jeopardized, intercepted, misused or mishandled, Navient may need to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and it may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation and settlement costs and financial losses that may either not be insured against or not be fully covered through insurance. If one or more of such events occur, Navient’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.  Navient depends on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications, and a breach or violation of law by one of these third parties could disrupt Navient’s business or provide its competitors with an opportunity to enhance their position at Navient’s expense.  Navient depends on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications. Third-party vendors are significantly involved in many aspects of Navient’s software and systems development, servicing systems, the timely transmission of information across its data communication network, and for other telecommunications, processing, remittance and technology-related services in connection with Navient’s servicing or payment services businesses. Navient also utilizes various third-party debt collectors in the collection of defaulted Private Education Loans and in other areas. If a service provider fails to provide the services required or expected, or fails to meet applicable contractual or regulatory requirements such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact Navient’s business by adversely affecting its ability to process customers’ transactions in a timely and accurate manner, otherwise hampering Navient’s ability to serve its customers, or subjecting Navient to litigation and regulatory risk for matters as diverse as poor vendor oversight or improper release or protection of personal information. Such a failure could also adversely affect the perception of the reliability of Navient’s networks and services and the quality of its brands, which could materially adversely affect Navient’s business and results of operations.  Navient’s work with government clients exposes it to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.  Navient’s clients include federal, state and local governmental entities. This work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:         •  Government entities in the United States often reserve the right to audit contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of business practices. These entities also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding systems, including systems of third parties, used in connection with the performance of the contracts. Negative findings from audits, investigations or inquiries could affect the contractor’s future revenues and profitability by preventing them, by operation of law or in practice, (i) from receiving new government contracts for some period of time or (ii) from being paid at the rate they believe is warranted.         •  If improper or illegal activities are found in the course of government audits or investigations, the contractor may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act. Additionally, Navient may be subject to administrative sanctions, which may include termination or non-renewal of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. Due to the inherent limitations of internal controls, it may not be possible to detect or prevent all improper or illegal activities.  The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only Navient’s business with the particular government entities involved, but also its business or potential future business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on its business or its results of operations.  If Navient is unable to attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, its business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  Navient’s success is dependent, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead its business. Experienced personnel in its industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is very high. Navient must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve its clients, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments, and grow and manage its business. As Navient expands its services and solutions, it must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals it has historically hired and retained. If Navient is unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, its ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for its services and solutions may suffer.   20    REPUTATIONAL/POLITICAL RISK. Reputational risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from damage to our reputation in the view of, or loss of the trust of, customers and the general public. Political risk is the closely related risk to earnings or capital arising from damage to our relationships with governmental entities, regulators and political leaders and candidates. These risks can arise due to both our own acts and omissions (both real and perceived), and the acts and omissions of other industry participants or other third parties, and they are inherent in all of our businesses.  Federal funding constraints and spending policy changes triggered by associated federal spending deadlines and ongoing lawmaker and regulatory efforts to change the student lending sector may result in disruption of federal payments for services Navient provides to the government, which could materially and adversely affect Navient’s business strategy or future business prospects.  Navient receives payments from the federal government on its FFELP Loan portfolio and for other services it provides, including servicing loans under the DSLP, providing default aversion and contingency collections to ED, and providing performance-based services to the IRS to support its national recovery program. Payments for these services may be affected by various factors, including the following:         •  The Budget Act: The Budget Act enacted on December 26, 2013, included several provisions that will have or could have an effect on Navient’s business. First, the Budget Act reduced the amount paid to guaranty agencies for defaulted FFELP Loans rehabilitated under Section 428F of the HEA, beginning on July 1, 2014. In addition, the Budget Act eliminated funding for the Direct Loan servicing performed by not-for-profit servicers. The Budget Act requires that all servicing funding be provided through the annual appropriations process which is subject to certain limitations. Although the payments for Navient’s DSLP servicing contract are already funded from annual appropriations, the requirement to fund all servicing from the limited appropriated funding could have an effect on our future business in ways the Company cannot predict at this time.         •  Other Higher Education Legislation: As Congress and the current Administration consider the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, they may consider legislation that would reduce the payments to Guarantors or change the consolidation program in a way that would incentivize education loan borrowers to refinance their existing education loans, both private and federal. Such reforms could reduce Navient’s cash flows from servicing and interest income as well as its net interest margin.  ED has also announced its intention to replace the current servicing contracts with various third parties including Navient’s Direct Loan servicing contract. ED has not issued a new RFP or RFPs for these services. As such, it is impossible to predict what changes, if any, will result. It is possible that the administration and Congress in the future could engage in a prolonged debate linking the federal deficit, debt ceiling and other budget issues. If U.S. lawmakers in the future fail to reach agreement on these issues, the federal government could stop or delay payment on its obligations, including those on services Navient provides. The 2016 presidential election in the United States had resulted in significant changes (or uncertainty) in governmental policies, regulatory environments, spending sentiment and many other factors and conditions, some of which could adversely impact Navient’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, legislation to address the federal deficit and spending could impose proposals that would adversely affect FFELP and DSLP-related servicing businesses. A protracted reduction, suspension or cancellation of the demand for the services Navient provides, or proposed changes to the terms or pricing of services provided under existing contracts with the federal government, including its contract with ED, could have a material adverse effect on Navient’s revenues, cash flows, profitability and business outlook, and, as a result, could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Navient cannot predict how or what programs or policies will be impacted by any actions that the Administration, Congress or the federal government may take.  Reputational Risk and Social Factors May Impact Our Results and Damage Our Brand. Negative public opinion or damage to our brand could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, security breaches (including the use and protection of customer information), corporate governance, and sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct. Such conduct could fall short of our customers’ and the public’s heightened expectations of companies of our size with rigorous data, privacy and compliance practices, and could further harm our reputation. In addition, third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us or the financial services industry. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the events discussed above will impact our reputation and business. 21    RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SPIN-OFF  Navient owes obligations, including service and indemnification obligations, to SLM BankCo under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the Spin-Off. These obligations could be materially disruptive to Navient’s business or subject it to substantial liabilities, including contingent liabilities and liabilities that are presently unknown.  In connection with the Spin-Off, Navient, SLM Corporation and SLM BankCo entered into various agreements. The performance by Navient of its obligations to SLM BankCo under these agreements may require the diversion of a significant amount of Navient management’s time from Navient’s operations and could be disruptive to its business operations.  The separation and distribution agreement between Navient, SLM Corporation and SLM BankCo provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make Navient financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist whether incurred prior to or after the Spin-Off, relating to the business activities of SLM Corporation prior to the Spin-Off, other than those arising out of the consumer banking business and expressly assumed by SLM BankCo pursuant to the Spin-Off and the separation and distribution agreement. This includes Navient being financially responsible for all servicing and collections activities that it performed or directed on behalf of Sallie Mae Bank. If Navient is required to indemnify SLM BankCo under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, Navient may be subject to substantial liabilities including liabilities that are accrued, contingent or otherwise and regardless of whether the liabilities were known or unknown at the time of the Spin-Off. SLM BankCo is party to various claims, litigation and legal, regulatory and other proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to its current and former operations. Previous business activities of SLM BankCo, including originations and acquisitions of various classes of consumer loans outside of Sallie Mae Bank, may also result in liability due to future laws, rules, interpretations or court decisions which purport to have retroactive effect, and such liability could be significant. SLM BankCo may also be subject to liabilities related to past activities of acquired businesses. It is inherently difficult, and in some cases impossible, to estimate the probable losses associated with contingent and unknown liabilities of this nature, but future losses may be substantial and will be borne by Navient in accordance with the terms of the separation and distribution agreement.  There could be significant liability to Navient if the Spin-Off is determined to be a taxable transaction.  The Spin-Off of Navient from SLM BankCo was intended to qualify as a reorganization under various provisions of the Code and as such to not be a taxable transaction. The Spin-Off was therefore conditioned on the receipt by SLM Corporation of a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, among other things, (i) the merger of SLM Corporation with and into a limited liability company wholly owned by SLM BankCo (the “SLM Merger”) (together with the conversion of the shares of SLM Corporation common and preferred stock into shares of SLM BankCo common and preferred stock pursuant to the SLM Merger) would qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and will not be integrated with the rest of the Spin-Off, and (ii) the Spin-Off would qualify as a “reorganization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition, the Spin-Off was conditioned on SLM BankCo’s receipt of an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that, with respect to certain requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code on which the IRS will not rule, such requirements will be satisfied. Both of these conditions were satisfied or waived prior to the Spin-Off. Navient received the private letter ruling from the IRS after the Spin-Off.  The ruling and the opinion rely on facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from SLM Corporation, SLM BankCo and Navient regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect, SLM BankCo and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. In addition, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling from the IRS and opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the SLM Merger and/or Spin-Off was taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the share ownership of SLM BankCo or Navient after the Spin-Off. If the SLM Merger and/or Spin-Off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, SLM BankCo and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities and Navient could incur significant liabilities related thereto.  GOVERNANCE RISK. Governance risk is the risk of not establishing and maintaining a control environment that aligns with stakeholder and regulatory expectations, including our relationship with the regulators as well as compliance environment within the Company and board oversight. These risks are inherent in all of our businesses.  Certain provisions of Delaware law and Navient’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws prevent or delay an acquisition of Navient, which could decrease the trading price of Navient’s common stock.  Certain provisions of Delaware law and of Navient’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by, among other things, encouraging  22    prospective acquirers to negotiate directly with Navient’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:         •  limitations on the ability of Navient’s stockholders to call a special meeting such that stockholder-requested special meetings will only be called upon the request of the holders of at least one-third of Navient’s capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors;         •  rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;         •  the right of Navient’s board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;         •  the inability of Navient’s stockholders to fill vacancies on Navient’s board of directors;         •  the requirement that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 percent in voting power of Navient’s stock entitled to vote thereon is required for stockholders to amend Navient’s amended and restated by-laws; and         •  the inability of Navient stockholders to cumulate their votes in the election of directors.  In addition, Navient’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation makes it subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 generally provides that, with limited exceptions, persons who acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, 15 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the time at which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. Being subject to Section 203 could cause a delay in or completely prevent a change of control that stockholders may favor.  Navient believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with Navient’s board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the Company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Navient’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of Navient and Navient’s stockholders.  Stockholders’ percentage ownership in Navient may be diluted in the future.  In the future, stockholders’ percentage ownership in Navient may be diluted as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that Navient may grant to its directors, officers and employees. For a period of time, Navient will continue and certain SLM BankCo employees may continue to have options to purchase shares of Navient common stock after the Spin-Off as a result of conversion of a portion of their SLM Corporation stock options to Navient stock options. From time to time, Navient may issue additional stock options or other equity-based awards to its employees under Navient’s employee benefits plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on Navient’s earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of Navient common stock.   In addition, Navient’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes Navient to issue, without the approval of Navient’s stockholders, one or more series of preferred stock. Navient’s board of directors generally may determine the rights of preferred stockholders including their powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over Navient’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions. If Navient’s board were to approve the issuance of preferred stock in the future, the terms of one or more series of such preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Navient’s common stock. For example, Navient could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of Navient’s directors in all circumstances or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, it could grant the preferred stockholders certain repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that could affect the value of the common stock.  Our certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.  Our certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our shareholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (“DGCL”) or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a shareholder in our company, holders of our common stock will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.  23    STRATEGIC RISK. Strategic risk is the risk to results of operations, cash flow or financial condition arising from our potential inability to successfully carry out our strategy. This risk can arise due to both our own acts or omissions, and the acts or omissions of other industry participants or other third parties, and it is inherent in all of our businesses. The success of our business plans depends upon achieving our strategic objectives, including through acquisition, joint ventures, dispositions and restructurings.  Acquisitions or strategic investments that Navient pursues may not be successful and could disrupt its business, harm its financial condition or reduce its earnings.  Navient’s growth strategy includes making opportunistic acquisitions of, or material investments in, loan portfolios, complementary businesses and products. In 2017, we acquired Duncan Solutions, a transportation revenue management company, and Earnest, a financial technology loan origination platform. Navient may not be able to identify suitable opportunities and, if not, this strategy could fail. Even if it is able to identify suitable opportunities, Navient may not be able to obtain financing necessary to allow Navient to make such acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all or obtain necessary regulatory approvals, or be able to complete the transactions on satisfactory terms. If the purchase price of any acquisition or investment is paid in cash, it may have an adverse effect on Navient’s financial condition; if the purchase price is paid with Navient stock, it could be dilutive to stockholders. Navient may assume liabilities, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.  In addition to the financial risks, acquisitions involve operational risks and Navient may not be able to successfully integrate personnel, operations, businesses, products or technologies acquired in an acquisition. There may be additional risks if Navient enters into a line of business in which it has limited experience or which operates in a legal, regulatory or competitive environment with which Navient is not familiar. Navient may not have or be able to maintain the expertise needed to manage the new business. The expected benefits of acquisitions and investments also may not be realized for various reasons, including the loss of key personnel, customers or vendors. If Navient fails to integrate or realize the expected benefits of its acquisitions or investments, it may lose the return on these acquisitions or investments or incur additional transaction costs, and its business and financial condition may be harmed as a result.  Under the separation and distribution agreement, Navient is precluded from conducting certain activities until January 1, 2019, including originating Private Education Loans. As a result, interest income and fee-based servicing revenue derived from its existing Private Education Loan portfolio is anticipated to decline as our existing portfolio amortizes. We also may not be able to develop revenue streams to replace the declining revenue from Private Education Loans.  Navient is not presently originating new in-school Private Education Loans and as part of its Spin-Off transaction agreed not to originate certain of these loans until January 1, 2019. As a result, interest income on Navient’s Private Education Loan portfolio and fee-based revenue on that portfolio are anticipated to decline over time as the loans are paid down, refinanced or charged off. If Navient does not begin to originate Private Education Loans as permitted under its separation and distribution agreement, acquire additional Private Education Loans or otherwise grow or develop new revenue streams to replace or supplement its Private Education Loan net interest and servicing revenue, Navient’s consolidated revenue and operating income will continue to decrease which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.  Navient’s businesses operate in competitive environments and could lose market share and revenues if competitors compete more aggressively or effectively.  Navient competes with for-profit and not-for-profit servicing, asset recovery and business processing businesses, many with strong records of performance. Navient competes based on effectiveness and customer service metrics. To the extent its competitors compete aggressively or more effectively than Navient, Navient could lose market share to them or Navient’s service offerings may not prove to be profitable.  Since the second quarter of 2009, Navient has been one of four large servicers (TIVAS) awarded a servicing contract by ED to service federal loans owned by ED. On August 27, 2014, ED extended its servicing contract with Navient to service federal loans for five more years. Under the terms of the contract extension, the allocation of additional volume will be determined twice each year based on the relative performance of the servicers utilizing five performance metrics. Quarterly scores in each metric are be averaged together twice each year to calculate the final result for each metric. Beginning on January 1, 2015, ED increased the aggregate allocation for not-for-profit servicers to 25 percent of all new DSLP borrowers.  If Navient is unable to improve its performance and increase its relative standing compared to the three other servicing companies with whom it competes, its ability to maintain or increase its servicing business with ED may be materially adversely affected.  24    Legislation passed by Congress in 2010 ended new loan originations under the FFELP program, and, as a result, net income on Navient’s existing FFELP Loan portfolio is anticipated to decline over time. Navient may not be able to develop revenue streams to fully replace the declining revenue from FFELP Loans.  In 2010, Congress passed legislation ending the origination of education loans under the FFELP program. Since then, all federal education loans have been originated through the DSLP of the ED. While the 2010 law did not alter or affect the terms and conditions of existing FFELP Loans, it significantly impacted the education loan industry. As a result of this legislation, net income on Navient’s FFELP Loan portfolio is anticipated to decline over time as existing FFELP Loans are paid down, refinanced or repaid after default by Guarantors. Additionally, the law has encouraged consolidation among FFELP servicers and guaranty agencies.      Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments
