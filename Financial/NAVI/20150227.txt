Item 1A. Risk Factors  Our business activities involve a variety of risks. Below we describe the significant risk factors affecting our business. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from our historic results as well as those projected in forward-looking statements.  Risks Related to Navient’s Business  Economic conditions and the creditworthiness of third parties could have a material adverse effect on Navient’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  Navient’s earnings are dependent on the expected future creditworthiness of its student loan customers, especially with respect to its Private Education Loan portfolio. High unemployment rates and the failure of its in-school borrowers to graduate are two of the most significant macroeconomic factors that could increase loan delinquencies, defaults and forbearance or the use or performance of its payment modifications programs, or otherwise negatively affect performance of its FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan portfolios. Forbearance programs may have the effect of delaying default emergence as customers are granted a temporary waiver from having to make payments on their loans. Therefore, deterioration in the economy could adversely affect the credit quality of its borrowers. Higher credit-related losses and weaker credit quality could negatively affect Navient’s business, financial condition and results of operations and limit funding options, including Navient’s access to the capital markets, which could also adversely impact its liquidity position.  Navient is also subject to the creditworthiness of other third parties, including counterparties and clearinghouses to derivative transactions. If a counterparty or clearinghouse fails to perform its obligations, Navient could, depending on the type of arrangement, experience a loss of liquidity or an economic loss. In addition, Navient might not be able to cost effectively replace the derivative position depending on the type of derivative and the current economic environment, and thus could be exposed to a greater level of interest rate and/or foreign currency exchange rate risk which could lead to additional losses. If counterparties or clearinghouses are unable to perform their obligations, Navient’s business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.  Legislation passed by Congress in 2010 ended new loan originations under the FFELP program, and, as a result, net income on its existing FFELP Loan portfolio will decline over time. Navient may not be able to develop revenue streams to replace the declining revenue from FFELP Loans.  In 2010, Congress passed legislation ending the origination of student loans under the FFELP program. All federal student loans are now originated through the DSLP of the ED. The law did not alter or affect the terms and conditions of existing FFELP Loans. As a result of this legislation, net income on Navient’s FFELP Loan portfolio will decline over time as existing FFELP Loans are paid down, refinanced or repaid after default by Guarantors. As of December 31, 2014, Navient’s FFELP Loan portfolio totaled $104.5 billion, compared with $103.2 billion as of December 31, 2013, and Navient’s intercompany FFELP Loan servicing revenue declined by $73 million, or 14 percent, compared to the prior year. If Navient does not acquire additional FFELP Loans or otherwise grow or develop new revenue streams to replace or supplement its existing, and declining, FFELP Loan net income, Navient’s consolidated revenue and operating income will continue to decrease which could materially and adversely impact Navient’s earnings.  Navient is not presently originating Private Education Loans and, as a result, interest income on its existing Private Education Loan portfolio and fee-based revenue from servicing and asset recovery on Private Education Loans will decline over time. Navient may not be able to develop revenue streams to replace the declining revenue from Private Education Loans.  Navient is not presently originating new Private Education Loans. As a result, interest income on Navient’s Private Education Loan portfolio and fee-based revenue on that portfolio will decline over time as the loans are    14    Table of Contents  paid down, refinanced or charged off. As of December 31, 2014, Navient’s Private Education Loan portfolio totaled $29.8 billion, compared with $31.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. Navient’s loan servicing revenue on this portfolio declined by $7 million or 23 percent compared with the prior year. If Navient does not begin to originate Private Education Loans as permitted under its separation and distribution agreement, acquire additional Private Education Loans or otherwise grow or develop new revenue streams to replace or supplement its existing and declining Private Education Loan net interest and servicing revenue, Navient’s consolidated revenue and operating income will continue to decrease which could materially and adversely impact Navient’s earnings.  Navient’s business is affected by the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets.  The capital markets have from time to time experienced periods of significant volatility. This volatility can dramatically and adversely affect financing costs when compared to historical norms. Additional factors that could make financing more expensive or unavailable to Navient include, but are not limited to, financial losses, events that have an adverse impact on Navient’s reputation, changes in the activities of Navient’s business partners, events that have an adverse impact on the financial services industry generally, counterparty availability, changes affecting Navient’s assets, corporate and regulatory actions, absolute and comparative interest rate changes, ratings agencies’ actions, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory and tax environments governing funding transactions. If financing becomes more difficult, expensive or unavailable, Navient’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  Navient’s credit ratings are important to its liquidity. A reduction in its credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity, increase its borrowing costs or limit its access to the capital markets.  As of December 31, 2014, all three credit rating agencies rate Navient’s long term unsecured debt at below investment grade. This has resulted in a higher cost of funds for the Company, and has caused its senior unsecured debt to trade with greater volatility. In addition, the capital markets for below investment grade companies are not as liquid as those involving investment grade entities.  The negative actions taken by the credit rating agencies since Navient’s separation transaction were based on concerns that the separation and distribution would reduce the sources of cash available to service its unsecured debt. According to their ratings reports, these concerns primarily focus on Navient’s lack of future Private Education Loan originations and related servicing income, the loss of access to the earnings, cash flow, equity and potential market value of Sallie Mae Bank, the run-off of the FFELP Loan portfolio and strategic uncertainty as to the source of incremental earnings and cash flow to replace that run off, and an expected increase in the Company’s cost of accessing the unsecured debt markets, including for refinancing purposes.  Navient’s unsecured debt totaled $17.4 billion at December 31, 2014, and Navient utilizes the unsecured debt markets to help fund its business and refinance outstanding debt. The amount, type and cost of its funding directly affects the cost of operating its business and growing its assets and is dependent upon outside factors, including its credit rating from rating agencies. There can be no assurance that the Company’s credit ratings will not be reduced further. A further reduction in the credit ratings of the Company’s senior unsecured debt could adversely affect Navient’s liquidity, increase its borrowing costs, limit its access to the capital markets and place incremental pressure on its net interest income.  The interest rate characteristics of Navient’s earning assets do not always match the interest rate characteristics of its funding arrangements, which may increase the price of, or decrease Navient’s ability to obtain, necessary liquidity.  Net interest income will be the primary source of cash flow generated by Navient’s portfolios of FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans. Interest earned on FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans is primarily indexed to one-month LIBOR rates and either one-month LIBOR rates or the one-month Prime rate, respectively, but Navient’s cost of funds will be primarily indexed to three-month LIBOR, creating the possibility of repricing risk related to these assets.    15    Table of Contents The different interest rate characteristics of Navient’s loan portfolios and liabilities funding these loan portfolios also result in basis risk and repricing risk. It is not possible to hedge all of Navient’s exposure to such risks. While the asset and hedge indices are short-term with rate movements that are typically highly correlated, there can be no assurance that the historically high correlation will not be disrupted by capital market dislocations or other factors not within Navient’s control. In these circumstances, Navient’s earnings could be materially adversely affected.  Higher than expected prepayments of loans could reduce servicing revenues or reduce or delay payments Navient receives as the holder of the Residual Interests of securitization trusts holding student loans.  FFELP Loans and Private Education Loans may be voluntarily prepaid without penalty by the borrower or, in the case of FFELP Loans, consolidated with the borrower’s other education loans through refinancing into the federal DSLP. FFELP Loans may also be repaid after default by the Guarantors of FFELP Loans. Prepayment rates and levels are subject to many factors beyond Navient’s control, including repayment through loan consolidation programs. When education loans contained within a securitization trust are prepaid, the fees Navient earns as servicer decrease and the value of any Residual Interest Navient owns in the securitization trust may decline. While some fluctuation in prepayment levels is to be expected, extraordinary or extended increases in prepayment levels could materially adversely affect our liquidity, income and the value of those Residual Interests.  Future initiatives by ED or by Congress, such as its Special Direct Consolidation Loan (“SDCL”) initiative launched in the fourth quarter of 2011 to encourage or force consolidation, or other factors affecting borrowers’ repayment of their loans, could reduce Navient’s cash flows from servicing and interest income as well as its net interest margin, which could materially adversely affect Navient’s liquidity and income.  Navient’s use of derivatives to manage interest rate and foreign currency sensitivity exposes it to credit and market risk that could have a material adverse effect on its earnings and liquidity.  Navient intends to maintain an overall strategy that uses derivatives to minimize the economic effect of interest rate and/or foreign currency changes. However, developing an effective strategy for dealing with these movements is complex, and no strategy can completely avoid the risks associated with these fluctuations. For example, Navient’s student loan portfolio remains subject to prepayment risk that could result in its being under- or over-hedged, which could result in material losses. In addition, Navient’s use of derivatives in its risk management activities could expose it to mark-to-market losses if interest rates or foreign currencies move in a materially different way than was expected when Navient entered into the related derivative contracts. As a result, there can be no assurance that hedging activities using derivatives will effectively manage Navient’s interest rate or foreign currency sensitivity, have the desired beneficial impact on its results of operations or financial condition or not adversely impact its liquidity and earnings.  Navient’s use of derivatives also exposes it to market risk and credit risk. Market risk is the chance of financial loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market liquidity. Navient’s Floor Income Contracts and some of the basis swaps it uses to manage earnings variability caused by different reset characteristics on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value, called the “mark-to-market,” of these derivative instruments is included in Navient’s statement of income. A decline in the fair value of these derivatives could have a material adverse effect on Navient’s reported earnings.  Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under a contract. Credit risk is limited to the loss of the fair value gain in a derivative that the counterparty or clearinghouse owes Navient and therefore exists for derivatives with a positive fair value. At December 31, 2014, Navient had a net positive exposure (derivative gain positions less collateral posted by counterparties) related to derivatives of $96 million, excluding securitization trusts discussed below. If a counterparty or clearinghouse fails to perform its obligations, Navient could, depending on the type of counterparty arrangement, experience a loss of liquidity or an economic loss. In addition, Navient might not be able to cost effectively replace the derivative position depending on the type of derivative and the current economic environment.    16    Table of Contents Navient’s securitization trusts, which it is required to consolidate on its balance sheet, had $9.3 billion of Euro and British Pound Sterling denominated bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2014. To convert these non-U.S. dollar denominated bonds into U.S. dollar liabilities, the trusts have entered into foreign-currency swaps with highly rated counterparties. In addition, the trusts have entered into $12.5 billion of interest rate swaps which are primarily used to convert Prime rate payments received on securitized loans to LIBOR paid on the bonds. At December 31, 2014, the net positive exposure on swaps in securitization trusts was $129 million. A failure by a swap counterparty to perform its obligations could, if the swap has a positive fair value to Navient, materially and adversely affect Navient’s earnings.  High or increasing interest rate environments may cause Navient’s Floor Income to decline, which may adversely affect its earnings.  FFELP Loans disbursed before April 1, 2006, generally earn interest at the higher of either the borrower rate, which is fixed over a period of time, or a floating rate based on a SAP formula set by ED. Navient has generally financed its FFELP Loans with floating rate debt whose interest is matched closely to the floating nature of the applicable SAP formula. If a decline in interest rates causes the borrower rate to exceed the SAP formula rate, Navient will continue to earn interest on the loan at the fixed borrower rate while the floating rate interest on Navient debt will continue to decline. The additional spread earned between the fixed borrower rate and the SAP formula rate is referred to as “Floor Income.”  Depending on the type of FFELP Loan and when it was originated, the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to a market rate on July 1 of each year. For loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term, Navient may earn Floor Income for an extended period of time; for those loans where the borrower interest rate is reset annually on July 1, Navient may earn Floor Income to the next reset date. In accordance with legislation enacted in 2006, holders of FFELP Loans are required to rebate Floor Income to ED for all FFELP Loans disbursed on or after April 1, 2006. After accounting for these required rebates, as of December 31, 2014, approximately $55 billion of Navient’s FFELP Loan portfolio was eligible to earn Floor Income.  Floor Income can be volatile as rates on the underlying student loans move up and down. Navient generally hedges this risk by using derivatives to lock in the value of the Floor Income over the term of the contract. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $27.2 billion (49 percent) of Navient’s FFELP Loans eligible to earn Floor Income was economically hedged. This amount Navient hedges declines over time. A rise in interest rates will reduce the amount of Floor Income received on the approximately $27.8 billion of FFELP Loans not hedged with Floor Income Contracts, which will compress Navient’s interest margins and depress its earnings.  Failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations could result in the loss of insurance or guarantees on FFELP Loans and other penalties that could have a material, negative impact on Navient’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  Loans serviced under the FFELP are subject to the HEA and related laws, rules, regulations and policies. Navient’s servicing operations are designed and monitored to comply with the HEA, related regulations and program guidance; however, ED could determine that Navient is not in compliance for a variety of reasons, including that it misinterpreted ED guidance or incorrectly applied the HEA and its related laws, rules, regulations and policies. Failure to comply could result in fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on affected FFELP Loans, expenses required to cure servicing deficiencies, suspension or termination of its right to participate as a FFELP servicer, negative publicity and potential legal claims. The imposition of significant fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on a material number of FFELP Loans, the incurrence of additional expenses and/or the loss of its ability to participate as a FFELP servicer could individually or in the aggregate have a material, negative impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations.  Defaults on student education loans held by Navient, particularly Private Education Loans, could adversely affect Navient’s earnings.  FFELP Loans are insured or guaranteed by state or not-for-profit agencies and are also protected by contractual rights to recovery from the United States pursuant to guaranty agreements among ED and these    17    Table of Contents  agencies. These guarantees generally cover at least 97 percent of a FFELP Loan’s principal and accrued interest and, in limited circumstances, 100 percent of the loan’s principal and accrued interest. Nevertheless, Navient is exposed to credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the FFELP Loans in its portfolio and to the possible loss of the insurance or guarantee due to a failure by Navient to comply with HEA and related regulations.  Navient bears the full credit exposure on Private Education Loans. For the year ended December 31, 2014, on a “Core Earnings” basis, the annualized charge-off rate for Navient’s Private Education Loans (as a percentage of loans in repayment) was 2.6 percent. Delinquencies are an important indicator of the potential future credit performance for Private Education Loans. Navient’s delinquencies as a percentage of Private Education Loans in repayment were 8.1 percent at December 31, 2014.  The evaluation of Navient’s allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that may be subject to significant changes. As of December 31, 2014, Navient’s allowance for FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan losses was approximately $93 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, Navient recognized provisions for FFELP Loan and Private Education Loan losses, on a “Core Earnings” basis, of $40 million and $539 million, respectively. The provision for loan losses reflects the activity for the applicable period and provides an allowance at a level that management believes is appropriate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. However, future defaults can be higher than anticipated due to a variety of factors outside of Navient’s control, such as downturns in the economy, regulatory or operational changes and other unforeseen future trends. Losses on Private Education Loans are also determined by risk characteristics such as school type, loan status (in-school, grace, forbearance, repayment and delinquency), loan seasoning (number of months in which a payment has been made), underwriting criteria (e.g., credit scores), a cosigner and the current economic environment. General economic and employment conditions, including employment rates for recent college graduates, during the recent recession led to higher rates of student loan defaults. Although default rates have decreased recently as economic conditions have improved, they remain higher than pre-recession levels. If actual loan performance is worse than currently estimated, it could materially affect Navient’s estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses in Navient’s statements of income and as a result adversely affect Navient’s results of operations.  Adverse market conditions or an inability to effectively manage its liquidity risk could negatively impact Navient’s ability to meet its liquidity and funding needs, which could materially and adversely impact its business operations and overall financial condition.  Navient must effectively manage the liquidity risk to which it is exposed. Navient requires liquidity to meet cash requirements such as day-to-day operating expenses, required payments of principal and interest on borrowings, and distributions to stockholders. Navient’s primary sources of liquidity are its current cash and investment portfolio, operating cash flows provided by operating activities, repayment of principal on unencumbered student loan assets, distributions from its securitization trusts (including servicing fees which are priority payments within the trusts) and issuance of additional unsecured debt. Navient may also draw down on its secured FFELP and Private Education Loan facilities or issue term asset-backed securities (“ABS”). Navient may maintain too much liquidity, which can be costly, or may be too illiquid, which could result in financial distress during times of financial stress or capital market disruptions.  A failure of the operating systems or infrastructure of Navient could disrupt its business, cause significant losses, result in regulatory action or damage its reputation.  A failure of Navient’s operating systems or infrastructure could disrupt its business. Navient’s business is dependent on its ability to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with legal and regulatory standards and its own product specifications, both currently and in the future. As Navient’s processing demands and loan portfolios change, both in volume and in terms and conditions, Navient’s ability to develop and maintain its operating systems and infrastructure will become increasingly challenging. There is no assurance that Navient has adequately or efficiently developed, maintained or acquired such systems and infrastructure or will do so in the future.    18    Table of Contents The servicing, financial, accounting, data processing and other operating systems and facilities that support Navient’s business may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are beyond Navient’s control, adversely affecting its ability to timely process transactions. Any such failure could adversely affect Navient’s ability to service its clients, result in financial loss or liability to its clients, disrupt its business, and result in regulatory action or cause reputational damage.  Despite the plans and facilities Navient has in place, its ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports its business. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, Internet, transportation or other services used by Navient or third parties with which it conducts business. Notwithstanding efforts to maintain business continuity, a disruptive event impacting Navient’s processing locations could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.  Navient depends on secure information technology, and a breach of its information technology systems could result in significant losses, disclosure of confidential customer information and reputational damage, which would adversely affect Navient’s business.  Navient’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal, confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Although Navient takes protective measures it deems reasonable and appropriate, its computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, malicious attacks and other events that could have a security impact beyond Navient’s control. These technologies, systems and networks, and those of third parties, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Navient’s or its customers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt Navient’s business operations or those of its customers or other third parties. Information security risks for institutions that handle large numbers of financial transactions on a daily basis such as Navient have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties.  If one or more of such events occur, personal, confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, Navient’s computer systems and networks could be jeopardized or could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Navient’s operations that could result in significant losses or reputational damage. Navient routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential and proprietary information, some of it through third parties. Navient put in place secure transmission capability and works to ensure that third parties follow similar procedures. Nevertheless, an interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm. In the event personal, confidential or other information is jeopardized, intercepted, misused or mishandled, Navient may need to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and it may be subject to fines, penalties, litigation and settlement costs and financial losses that may either not be insured against or not be fully covered through insurance. If one or more of such events occur, Navient’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.  Navient depends on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications, and a breach or violation of law by one of these third parties could disrupt Navient’s business or provide its competitors with an opportunity to enhance their position at Navient’s expense.  Navient depends on third parties for a wide array of services, systems and information technology applications. Third-party vendors are significantly involved in aspects of Navient’s software and systems development, the timely transmission of information across its data communication network, and for other telecommunications, processing, remittance and technology-related services in connection with Navient’s payment services businesses. Navient also utilizes third-party debt collectors in the collection of defaulted Private Education Loans. If a service provider fails to provide the services required or expected, or fails to meet    19    Table of Contents  applicable contractual or regulatory requirements such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact Navient’s business by adversely affecting its ability to process customers’ transactions in a timely and accurate manner, otherwise hampering Navient’s ability to serve its customers, or subjecting Navient to litigation and regulatory risk for matters as diverse as poor vendor oversight or improper release or protection of personal information. Such a failure could also adversely affect the perception of the reliability of Navient’s networks and services and the quality of its brands, which could materially adversely affect Navient’s business and results of operations.  Federal funding constraints and spending policy changes triggered by associated federal spending deadlines and ongoing lawmaker and regulatory efforts to change the student lending sector may result in disruption of federal payments for services Navient provides to the government, which could materially and adversely affect Navient’s business strategy or future business prospects.  Navient receives payments from the federal government on its FFELP Loan portfolio and for other services it provides, including servicing loans under the DSLP and providing default aversion and contingency collections to ED. Payments for these services may be affected by various factors, including the following:        •    The Budget Act enacted on December 26, 2013, includes several provisions that will have or could have an effect on Navient’s business. First, the Budget Act reduced the amount paid to guaranty agencies for defaulted FFELP Loans rehabilitated under Section 428F of the HEA, beginning on July 1, 2014. In addition, the Budget Act eliminated funding for the Direct Loan servicing performed by not-for-profit servicers. The Budget Act requires that all servicing funding be provided through the annual appropriations process which is subject to certain limitations. Although the payments for Navient’s DSLP servicing contract is already funded from annual appropriations, the requirement to fund all servicing from the limited appropriated funding could have an effect on its future business in ways the Company cannot predict at this time.        •    Other Higher Education Legislation: As Congress considers the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, it may consider legislation that would reduce the payments to Guarantors or change the consolidation program to incentivize student loan borrowers to refinance their existing student loans, both private and federal. Such reforms could reduce Navient’s cash flows from servicing and interest income as well as its net interest margin.  It is possible that the Administration and Congress in the future could engage in a prolonged debate linking the federal deficit, debt ceiling and other budget issues. If U.S. lawmakers in the future fail to reach agreement on these issues, the federal government could stop or delay payment on its obligations, including those on services Navient provides. Navient cannot predict how or what programs will be impacted by any actions that the Administration, Congress or the federal government may take. Further, legislation to address the federal deficit and spending could include proposals that would adversely affect FFELP and DSLP-related servicing businesses. A protracted reduction, suspension or cancellation of the demand for the services Navient provides, or proposed changes to the terms or pricing of services provided under existing contracts with the federal government, including its contract with ED, could have a material adverse effect on Navient’s revenues, cash flows, profitability and business outlook, and, as a result, could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.  If Navient does not effectively align its cost structure with its business operations, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  Navient will need to align its cost structure with its business operations to remain profitable. Navient intends to make opportunistic acquisitions of additional FFELP Loans, both to increase cash flow from its loan portfolio and to expand its FFELP Loan servicing business. It will need to undertake other initiatives to grow its business. Navient’s ability to properly size its cost structure will be dependent upon a number of variables, including its ability to successfully execute on its business plan and future legislative changes that may increase its compliance costs or otherwise impact its business. If Navient undertakes cost reductions based on its business    20    Table of Contents  plan, those reductions could be too dramatic and could cause disruptions in its business, reductions in the quality of the services it provides or cause it to fail to comply with applicable regulatory standards. Alternatively, Navient may fail to implement, or be unable to achieve, necessary cost savings commensurate with its business and prospects. In either case, Navient’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of Navient’s consolidated financial statements could adversely affect Navient’s reported assets, liabilities, income, revenue or expenses.  The preparation of Navient’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenue or expenses during the reporting periods. Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management could adversely affect Navient’s reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If Navient makes incorrect assumptions or estimates, it may under- or overstate reported financial results, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.  Acquisitions or strategic investments that Navient pursues may not be successful and could disrupt its business, harm its financial condition or reduce its earnings.  Navient’s strategy includes making opportunistic acquisitions of, or material investments in, complementary businesses, products and portfolios of loans. Navient may not be able to identify suitable opportunities and, if not, this strategy could fail. Navient may not be able to obtain financing necessary to allow Navient to make such acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all or obtain necessary regulatory approvals, or be able to complete the transactions on satisfactory terms. If the purchase price of any acquisition or investment is paid in cash, it may have an adverse effect on Navient’s financial condition; if the purchase price is paid with Navient stock, it could be dilutive to stockholders. Navient may assume liabilities, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have an adverse effect on Navient’s financial condition.  Navient may not be able to successfully integrate personnel, operations, businesses, products, or technologies of an acquisition. There may be additional risks if Navient enters into a line of business in which it has limited experience or the business operates in a legal, regulatory or competitive environment with which it is not familiar. Navient may not have or be able to maintain the expertise needed to manage the new business. The expected benefits of acquisitions and investments also may not be realized for various reasons, including the loss of key personnel, customers or vendors. If Navient fails to integrate or realize the expected benefits of its acquisitions or investments, it may lose the return on these acquisitions or investments or incur additional transaction costs, and its business and financial condition may be harmed as a result.  If Navient is unable to attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, its business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  Navient’s success is dependent, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skills to lead its business. Experienced personnel in its industry are in high demand, and competition for talent is very high. Navient must hire, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in order to serve its clients, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing technology, industry and macroeconomic developments, and grow and manage its business. As Navient expands its services and solutions, it must also hire and retain an increasing number of professionals with different skills and professional expectations than those of the professionals it has historically hired and retained. If Navient is unable to successfully integrate, motivate and retain these professionals, its ability to continue to secure work in those industries and for its services and solutions may suffer.    21    Table of Contents Navient’s servicing and asset recovery businesses operate in competitive environments and could lose market share and revenues if competitors compete more aggressively or effectively.  Navient competes in the servicing and asset recovery businesses with for-profit and non-profit servicing institutions, many with strong records of performance. Navient competes based on capability and customer service metrics. To the extent its competitors compete aggressively or more effectively than Navient, Navient could lose market share to them or Navient’s service offerings may not prove to be profitable.  Since the second quarter of 2009, Navient has been one of four large servicers awarded a servicing contract by ED to service federal loans owned by ED. Navient services approximately 6.2 million accounts under this servicing contract as of December 31, 2014. The servicing contract spans five years with the possibility of one five-year renewal at the option of ED. On August 27, 2014, ED extended its servicing contract with Navient to service federal loans for five more years. Under the terms of the contract extension, the allocation of ongoing volume will be determined twice each year based on the relative performance of the servicers of five metrics: borrowers in current repayment status (30 percent), borrowers more than 90 but less than 271 days delinquent (15 percent), borrowers 271 days or more up to 360 days delinquent (15 percent), a survey of borrowers (35 percent), and a survey of ED personnel (5 percent). Quarterly scores in each metric will be averaged together twice each year to calculate the final result of each metric. Navient’s allocation under the servicing contract increased to 24 percent for the period beginning August 15, 2014 from 18 percent for the prior period beginning August 15, 2013. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the aggregate allocation for not-for-profit servicers increased to 25 percent of all new DSLP borrowers. Navient earned $130 million of revenue under the contract for the year ended December 31, 2014.  If Navient is unable to improve on these and increase its relative standing compared to the three other servicing companies it competes with for account allocations under the servicing contract, its ability to increase its servicing business with ED may be materially adversely affected.  Changes in law, regulation or regulatory policy involving student loans could have a material impact on Navient’s profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects.  Navient’s businesses are subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations and changes to such laws and regulations or changes in existing regulatory guidance or their interpretation could adversely impact Navient’s business and results of operations if it is not able to adequately mitigate the impact of such changes.  The Company’s FFELP Loan business has been affected extensively by changes in law, most notably by the legislation Congress passed in 2010 to eliminate new FFELP Loans.  The Company’s Private Education Loan business may also be impacted by changes in law, regulations or regulatory policy. For example, the CFPB’s 2014 Report recommended that Congress consider: (i) making changes to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code’s treatment of private education loans in order to motivate lenders to more constructively work with borrowers struggling to make payments, (ii) making reforms to the disclosures and guidelines that apply to borrower repayment options and loan modification programs and (iii) assessing the impact of tax treatment of principal forgiveness on loan modification activity. In the future, Congress or the Administration may act on these recommendations or choose to take actions beyond or unrelated to the CFPB’s recommendations to further regulate the private student loan market or dictate the terms and conditions applicable to private student loans. Additionally, even in the absence of Congress or the Administration pursing the CFPB’s recommendations, the CFPB may use its regulatory authority and enforcement actions to make substantial changes on its own to the private student loan or loan servicing markets and we believe that the CFPB has shown through its actions that it is willing to do so. The taking of any such actions may adversely impact the profitability and growth of Navient’s business and/or significantly alter the costs and manner in which Navient conducts this business.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contains comprehensive provisions that govern the practices and oversight of financial institutions (including large non-bank financial institutions) and other participants in the financial markets. It imposed significant regulations on almost every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including enhanced supervisory authority over Navient’s business. Many of the Dodd-Frank Act’s provisions have become effective but remain subject to interpretation and formal implementation by regulatory authorities through final rulemaking. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB and other financial regulators have    22    Table of Contents  introduced and continue to introduce new regulations and guidance, even as they impose enforcement actions against financial institutions and financial service providers which often contain additional cautions and guidance which must be taken into consideration. Due to the uncertainty engendered by these new regulations, guidance and actions, coupled with the likelihood of additional changes or additions to the statutes, regulations and practices applicable to its business, Navient is not able to estimate the ultimate impact of changes in law on its financial results, business operations or strategies. Navient believes that the cost of responding to and complying with these evolving laws and regulations, as well as any guidance from enforcement actions, will continue to increase, as will the risk of penalties and fines from any enforcement actions that may be imposed on its businesses. Navient’s profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result.  The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes state officials to enforce regulations issued by the CFPB and to enforce the Dodd-Frank Act’s general prohibition against unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. Most states also have statutes that prohibit unfair and deceptive practices. To the extent states enact requirements that differ from federal standards or state officials and courts adopt interpretations of federal consumer laws that differ from those adopted by the CFPB under the Dodd-Frank Act, or states increase their examination, supervision and enforcement activities, Navient’s compliance costs could increase and reduce its ability to offer the same products and services to consumers nationwide and it may be subject to a higher risk of state enforcement actions.  Navient’s business may be adversely impacted by increased expenditures due to changes in law or agency interpretations, increased regulatory oversight or supervision and possible remediation efforts and penalties.  The CFPB has broad authority with respect to Navient’s loan servicing business. It has authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws and to directly or indirectly enforce those laws and examine Navient for compliance. The CFPB also has examination and enforcement authority with respect to various federal consumer financial laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services, including Navient. In December 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule, effective March 14, 2014, defining “larger participants” in the student loan servicing market that will be subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB, a category that will include Navient’s student loan servicing subsidiaries.  The CFPB is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices and to ensure that all consumers have access to fair, transparent and competitive markets for consumer financial products and services. The review of products and practices to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive conduct will be a continuing focus of the CFPB. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain, but it has resulted in, and could continue to result in, changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties.  In furtherance of its regulatory and supervisory powers, the CFPB has the authority to impose monetary penalties for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws, require remediation of practices and pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of applicable federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB’s own rules). The CFPB has the authority to issue cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties ranging from $5,000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to $25,000 per day for reckless violations and $1 million per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations implemented under Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions to remedy violations of state law. If the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that Navient has violated any of the applicable laws or regulations, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that could have a material adverse effect on Navient or its business.    23    Table of Contents Loans serviced under the FFELP are subject to the HEA and related regulations. Navient’s servicing operations are designed and monitored to comply with the HEA, related regulations and program guidance; however, ED could determine that Navient is not in compliance for a variety of reasons, including that Navient misinterpreted ED guidance or incorrectly applied the HEA and its related regulations or policies. Failure to comply could result in fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on affected FFELP Loans, expenses required to cure servicing deficiencies, suspension or termination of Navient’s right to participate as a FFELP servicer, negative publicity and potential legal claims. The imposition of significant fines, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on a material number of FFELP Loans, the incurrence of additional expenses and/or the loss of Navient’s ability to participate as a FFELP servicer could individually or in the aggregate have a material, negative impact on Navient’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  Expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of Navient’s businesses will increase its costs and risks.  Navient’s businesses and operations are increasingly subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny. In recent years, Navient has entered into several Consent Orders with the FDIC, the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and other banking regulators and settlements of enforcement actions with various governmental agencies. Navient has paid significant fines and penalties or provided monetary and other relief in connection with many of these actions and settlements.  In addition, Navient is devoting substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of these Consent Orders and settlements, enhancing its procedures and controls, expanding the risk and control functions within each line of business, investing in technology and hiring additional risk, control and compliance personnel, all of which has increased its operational and compliance costs.  If Navient fails to successfully address the requirements of the Consent Orders or the regulatory settlements of enforcement actions it is currently subject, or more generally to effectively enhance its risk and control procedures and processes to meet the heightened expectations of its regulators and other government agencies, it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses, which could adversely affect its operations and, in turn, its financial results.  Navient expects heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions to continue for it and the for the financial services industry as a whole. Navient anticipates that regulators will continue to take formal enforcement action, rather than taking informal supervisory actions, more frequently than they have done historically. Such actions can have significant consequences for a financial institution such as Navient, including loss of customers and business and the inability to operate certain businesses.  Navient’s asset recovery business is subject to significant regulation and oversight by state and federal agencies, and a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in significant costs, sanctions and litigation.  Navient’s asset recovery business is subject to regulation and oversight by various state and federal agencies, particularly in the area of consumer protection, and is subject to numerous state and federal laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in significant costs, including litigation costs, and/or business sanctions including but not limited to termination or non-renewal of contracts. In addition, changes to such laws and regulations could adversely impact Navient’s business and results of operations if it is not able to adequately mitigate the impact of such changes. Navient is now and may be subject in the future, to inquiries and audits from state and federal regulators as well as litigation from private plaintiffs.    24    Table of Contents Navient’s work with government clients exposes it to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.  Navient’s clients include federal, state and local governmental entities. This work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:        •    Government entities in the United States often reserve the right to audit contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of business practices. These entities also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding systems, including systems of third parties, used in connection with the performance of the contracts. Negative findings from audits, investigations or inquiries could affect the contractor’s future revenues and profitability by preventing them, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time or prevent them from being paid at the rate they believe is warranted.        •    If improper or illegal activities are found in the course of government audits or investigations, the contractor may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination or non-renewal of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. Due to the inherent limitations of internal controls, all improper or illegal activities may not be prevented or detected.  The occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only Navient’s business with the particular government entities involved, but also its business or potential future business with other entities of the same or other governmental bodies or with commercial clients, and could have a material adverse effect on its business or its results of operations.  Navient’s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating the risk of loss.  Navient’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and returns. Navient has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, control and report the types of risk to which it is subject. Navient seeks to monitor and control risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures, limits and reporting requirements. Management of risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. If the models that Navient uses to mitigate these risks are inadequate, it may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that Navient has not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If Navient’s risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate risks, Navient could suffer unexpected losses, and its financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Navient is subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities that may affect its results of operations.  Navient is subject to evolving and complex federal and state tax laws. Significant judgment is required for determining Navient’s tax liabilities, and Existing SLM’s tax returns have been, and Navient’s tax returns will continue to be, periodically examined by various tax authorities. Navient will have, among other tax liabilities, risks for future tax contingencies arising from operations post-separation. Due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matters related to operations post-separation may result in payments greater or less than amounts accrued.  In addition, Navient may be impacted by changes in tax laws, including tax rate changes, changes to the laws related to the treatment and remittance of foreign earnings, new tax laws and subsequent interpretations of tax laws by federal and state tax authorities.    25    Table of Contents Risks Related to the Separation  Navient’s historical and pro forma financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that it would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of its future results.  Due to the relative significance of Navient to Existing SLM, among other factors, Navient is treated as the “accounting successor” to Existing SLM for financial reporting purposes, notwithstanding the legal form of the separation described in this Form 10-K. Hence, Navient’s historical consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K are the consolidated financial statements of Existing SLM. Accordingly, the historical financial information for Navient included in this Form 10-K does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that Navient would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that Navient will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:        •    Prior to the separation, Navient’s business had been operated by Existing SLM as part of its broader corporate organization in combination with those businesses that are held by SLM BankCo after the separation and distribution. Some of the SLM BankCo businesses performed services for or engaged in intercompany transactions with the businesses that are held by Navient after the separation and distribution. Navient’s pro forma financial results included in its Form 10 reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Existing SLM for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses Navient will incur operating as a separate company from Existing SLM. After the separation and distribution, Navient may not be able to operate its business efficiently or at comparable costs, and its profitability may decline.        •    Prior to the separation, Navient’s historical financial statements include the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows attributable to Existing SLM’s consumer banking business, including Sallie Mae Bank, which are held by SLM BankCo after the separation and distribution.  Other significant changes will occur in Navient’s cost structure, management, financing and business operations as the Company continues to operate as a company separate from the combined businesses of Existing SLM.  The migration of systems from Navient’s information technology platform to support SLM BankCo may be disruptive to Navient’s business and Navient’s ability to service its customers.  Navient Solutions, Inc. (“NSI”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, currently services substantially all of the education loans held by the Company, as well as a portfolio of education loans held by Sallie Mae Bank. During a transition period after the separation and distribution which may last until 2016, NSI will continue to host and provide Private ServiceCo, a subsidiary of SLM BankCo, with access to Navient’s information technology systems and services to enable Private ServiceCo to service the Private Education Loans held at and serviced by Sallie Mae Bank. During this transition period, SLM BankCo will work to create its own, or engage third parties to provide, the information systems and services to replace those provided by Navient. Disruptions to Navient’s information technology systems during this period, including the inability of customers with more than one type of student loan to speak to a single customer service representative, could occur. Any perceived disruption of Navient’s or SLM BankCo’s ability to service their customers may damage Navient’s reputation and have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, although the transition period is expected to be less than 24 months, unforeseen circumstances or significant third-party delays could significantly extend this period. Any extension of the transition period may increase the costs incurred by Navient to provide transition assistance to SLM BankCo and may increase the chance of a disruption to Navient’s information technology systems and its businesses.    26    Table of Contents Navient will owe obligations, including service and indemnification obligations, to SLM BankCo under various transaction agreements that have been executed as part of the separation. These obligations could be materially disruptive to Navient’s business or subject it to substantial liabilities, including contingent liabilities and liabilities that are presently unknown.  In connection with the separation and distribution, Navient, Existing SLM and SLM BankCo entered into various agreements, including, among others, a transition services agreement, a tax sharing agreement, an employee matters agreement, a loan servicing and administration agreement, a joint marketing agreement, a key systems agreement, a data sharing agreement and a sublease agreement. Under the transition services agreement, a subsidiary of Navient hosts and provides SLM BankCo with access to Navient’s information technology systems and services, and Navient assists SLM BankCo migrating its customer data and service functions to a separate environment. The performance by Navient of its obligations to SLM BankCo under these agreements may require the diversion of a significant amount of Navient management’s time from Navient’s operations and could be disruptive to its business operations.  The separation and distribution agreement between Navient, Existing SLM and SLM BankCo provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make Navient financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist whether incurred prior to or after the separation, relating to the business activities, of Existing SLM prior to the separation and distribution, other than those arising out of the consumer banking business and expressly assumed by SLM BankCo pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. This includes Navient being financially responsible for all servicing and collections activities that it performed or directed on behalf of Sallie Mae Bank. If Navient is required to indemnify SLM BankCo under the circumstances set forth in the separation and distribution agreement, Navient may be subject to substantial liabilities including liabilities that are accrued, contingent or otherwise and regardless of whether the liabilities were known or unknown at the time of the separation and distribution. SLM BankCo is party to various claims, litigation and legal, regulatory and other proceedings resulting from ordinary business activities relating to its current and former operations. Previous business activities of SLM BankCo, including originations and acquisitions of various classes of consumer loans outside of Sallie Mae Bank, may also result in liability due to future laws, rules, interpretations or court decisions which purport to have retroactive effect, and such liability could be significant. SLM BankCo may also be subject to liabilities related to past activities of acquired businesses. It is inherently difficult, and in some cases impossible, to estimate the probable losses associated with contingent and unknown liabilities of this nature, but future losses may be substantial and will be borne by Navient in accordance with the terms of the separation and distribution agreement.  There could be significant liability to Navient if the distribution is determined to be a taxable transaction.  The separation and distribution of Navient from SLM BankCo was intended to qualify as a reorganization under various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and as such to not be a taxable transaction. The separation and distribution was therefore conditioned on the receipt by Existing SLM of a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, among other things, (i) the SLM Merger (together with the conversion of the shares of Existing SLM common and preferred stock into shares of SLM BankCo common and preferred stock pursuant to the SLM Merger) will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and will not be integrated with the rest of the separation and distribution, and (ii) the separation and distribution will qualify as a “reorganization” for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In addition, the distribution was conditioned on SLM BankCo’s receipt of an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that, with respect to certain requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code on which the IRS will not rule, such requirements will be satisfied. Both of these conditions were satisfied or waived prior to the distribution. Navient received the private letter ruling from the IRS after the distribution.  The ruling and the opinion rely on facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Existing SLM, SLM BankCo and Navient regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect, SLM BankCo and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant    27    Table of Contents  tax liabilities. In addition, notwithstanding receipt of the private letter ruling from the IRS and opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the SLM Merger and/or separation and distribution was taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the share ownership of SLM BankCo or Navient after the separation. If the SLM Merger and/or separation and distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, SLM BankCo and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities and Navient could incur significant liabilities related thereto.  Navient’s ability to engage in stockholder distributions and other strategic corporate transactions in the near term could be limited.  To preserve the tax-free treatment to SLM BankCo of the separation and the distribution, Navient and SLM BankCo entered into a tax sharing agreement that restricts Navient from engaging in certain transactions. These restrictions are intended to prevent the distribution and related transactions from becoming taxable to SLM BankCo and its stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the tax sharing agreement, for up to a two-year period following the distribution (the “Restricted Period”), Navient is prohibited from, among other things:        •    issuing shares of Navient stock equal to or exceeding 25 percent of the shares of Navient stock issued and outstanding immediately following the distribution date, including to raise capital or as acquisition currency in furtherance of strategic transactions, such as for the purchase of additional portfolios of student loans;        •    selling 50 percent or more of the assets of the loan management, servicing and asset recovery business or engaging in mergers or other strategic transactions that may result in a change of control of Navient (as determined under U.S. federal income tax law);        •    repurchasing outstanding shares of its common stock, other than in open market repurchases constituting less than 20 percent of such stock outstanding immediately following the distribution date; and        •    ceasing to actively conduct its business or liquidating.  The foregoing prohibitions are in some cases more restrictive than those required under the Code due to the potential significant liability to SLM BankCo and its stockholders were the separation and the distribution determined to be a taxable transaction. Under the tax sharing agreement, Navient has the ability to engage in certain otherwise prohibited transactions, such as additional stock issuances or stock repurchases during the Restricted Period, provided it first delivers to SLM BankCo a tax opinion reasonably satisfactory to SLM BankCo or an IRS ruling that doing so will not adversely affect the tax-free treatment of the separation and the distribution.  The foregoing prohibitions could limit Navient’s ability to pursue strategic transactions or other transactions during the Restricted Period that it may believe to be in the best interests of its stockholders or that might increase the value of its business. In addition, under the tax sharing agreement, Navient is required to indemnify SLM BankCo against any tax liabilities incurred as a result of the violation of any of the foregoing restrictions, as well as any transaction (or series of transactions) that results in the distribution being considered part of a plan by Navient that includes a later change in control of Navient during the Restricted Period (as determined under U.S. federal income tax law).  Navient may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, and the separation may adversely affect its business.  Navient may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. We believe that the separation and distribution provided the following benefits, among others: (i) a distinct investment identity allowing investors to evaluate the merits, performance, and future prospects of Navient separately from SLM BankCo; (ii) cash flows significantly    28    Table of Contents  in excess of debt service obligations; (iii) more efficient allocation of capital for both Navient and SLM BankCo; (iv) a reduced likelihood that Navient is designated a systemically important financial institution; and (v) a separate equity structure that allows direct access by Navient to the capital markets and the use of Navient equity for acquisitions and equity compensation.  Navient may not achieve other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (a) the separation will require significant amounts of management’s time and effort, which may divert management’s attention from operating Navient’s business; (b) Navient may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it were still a part of Sallie Mae; (c) Navient’s business is less diversified than Existing SLM’s business prior to the separation; (d) absent the acquisition of new loan portfolios or new sources of fee income, Navient’s revenue and operating margin will decline as its FFELP Loan portfolio amortizes over the next 20 years; and (e) remaining actions related to separating SLM BankCo’s and Navient’s respective businesses could disrupt Navient’s operations. If Navient fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, the business, financial condition and results of operations of Navient could be adversely affected and the value of its stock could be impacted.  Shareholders’ percentage ownership in Navient may be diluted in the future.  In the future, shareholders’ percentage ownership in Navient may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that Navient may grant to Navient’s directors, officers and employees. Navient’s and SLM BankCo’s employees will continue to have options to purchase shares of Navient common stock after the distribution as a result of conversion of a portion of their Existing SLM stock options to Navient stock options. From time to time, Navient will issue additional stock options or other equity-based awards to its employees under Navient’s employee benefits plans. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on Navient’s earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of Navient common stock.  In addition, Navient’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes Navient to issue, without the approval of Navient’s stockholders, one or more series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over Navient’s common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as Navient’s board of directors generally may determine. If Navient’s board were to approve the issuance of preferred stock in the future, the terms of one or more series of such preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of Navient’s common stock. For example, Navient could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of Navient’s directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences Navient could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.  Certain provisions of Delaware law and Navient’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws prevent or delay an acquisition of Navient, which could decrease the trading price of Navient’s common stock.  Certain provisions of Delaware law and of Navient’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by, among other things, making such practices or bids encouraging prospective acquirors to negotiate with Navient’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:        •    limitations on the ability of Navient’s stockholders to call a special meeting such that stockholder-requested special meetings will only be called upon the request of the holders of at least one-third of Navient’s capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors;        •    rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;    29    Table of Contents     •    the right of Navient’s board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;        •    the inability of Navient’s stockholders to fill vacancies on Navient’s board of directors;        •    the requirement that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 percent in voting power of Navient’s stock entitled to vote thereon is required for stockholders to amend Navient’s amended and restated by-laws; and        •    the inability of Navient stockholders to cumulate their votes in the election of directors.  In addition, because Navient has not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the DGCL, this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders may favor. Section 203 generally provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, 15 percent of more of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the time at which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of 15 percent of more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock.  Navient believes these provisions protect its stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with Navient’s board of directors and by providing Navient’s board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the Company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Navient’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of Navient and Navient’s stockholders.
