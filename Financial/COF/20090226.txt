Item 1A. Risk Factors “We Face Intense Competition in All of Our Markets.”  Intellectual Property  As part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property, we rely on a variety of protections, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure and competition. We also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information. In addition, our competitors also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry. The ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete. Conversely, our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts, or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results.  Employees  As of December 31, 2008, we employed approximately 25,800 employees whom we refer to as “associates.” A central part of our philosophy is to attract and maintain a highly capable staff. We view current associate relations to be satisfactory. None of our associates is covered under a collective bargaining agreement.  Supervision and Regulation  General  The Company is a bank holding company (“BHC”) under Section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”) (12 U.S.C. § 1842). The Company is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act, including its capital adequacy standards and limitations on the Company’s nonbanking activities, and to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board (the “Federal Reserve”). Permissible activities for a BHC include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the Federal Reserve by regulation or order. Certain servicing activities are also permissible for a BHC if conducted for or on behalf of the BHC or any of its affiliates. Impermissible activities for BHCs include activities that are related to commerce such as retail sales of nonfinancial products. Under Federal Reserve policy, the Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any banks that it controls, including COBNA and CONA (the “Banks”), and to commit resources to support them.  On May 27, 2005, the Company became a “financial holding company” under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amendments to the BHC Act (the “GLBA”). The GLBA removed many of the restrictions on the activities of BHCs that become financial holding companies. A financial holding company, and the non-bank companies under its control, are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature (including, for example, insurance underwriting, agency sales and brokerage, securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage and merchant banking activities); incidental to financial activities; or complementary to financial activities if the Federal Reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general.  The Company’s election to become a financial holding company under the GLBA certifies that the depository institutions the Company controls meet certain criteria, including capital, management and Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requirements. If the Company were to fail to continue to meet the criteria for financial holding company status, it could, depending on which requirements it failed to meet, face restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions and/or be required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies.  COBNA and CONA are national associations chartered under the laws of the United States, the deposits of which are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) up to applicable limits. In addition to regulatory requirements imposed as a result of COBNA’s international operations (discussed below), COBNA and CONA are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the OCC and the FDIC.  On January 1, 2008, Capital One Auto Finance, Inc. (“COAF”), which engages in automobile financing activities, became a wholly owned subsidiary of CONA. In connection with the COAF reorganization, which included the transfer of approximately $10 billion in assets, the Corporation     10    Table of Contents  committed to the Federal Reserve to contribute capital to CONA equal to the amount of transferred assets that are or become low-quality assets (as defined in Regulation W) and to hold an amount of risk based capital equal to the book value of low-quality assets. CONA must consider these commitments, in addition to the factors outlined in “Dividends and Transfers of Funds” below, among other factors when declaring a dividend to the Company.  The Company is also registered as a financial institution holding company under Virginia law and as such is subject to periodic examination by Virginia’s Bureau of Financial Institutions. The Company also faces regulation in the international jurisdictions in which it conducts business (see below under International Regulation).  On February 13, 2009, the Company received approval from the Federal Reserve to acquire all the shares of Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., and certain of its subsidiaries. Subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, the Company expects to merge Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., with and into CONA prior to the end of 2009.  Regulation of Business Activities  The activities of the Banks as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various federal laws, including the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”), the Community Reinvestment Act and the Service members Civil Relief Act, as well as under various state laws. Depending on the underlying issue and applicable law, regulators are often authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and, in certain cases, to order the Banks to compensate injured borrowers. Borrowers may also have a private right of action to bring actions for certain violations. Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also affect the ability of the Banks to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers. These laws plus state sales finance laws also affect the ability of our automobile financing business to collect outstanding balances.  New Regulations  On December 18, 2008, the Federal Reserve amended Regulation AA to include new rules that would place limitations on certain credit card practices. Among other things, the final rules: (i) impose restrictions on increases in the rate charged on pre-existing credit card balances; (ii) prohibit the use of payment allocation methods that maximize interest charges; (iii) limit the imposition of “default” annual percentage rates on existing credit card balances; (iv) prohibit the imposition of interest charges using the “two-cycle” billing method; and (v) require that consumers receive a certain amount of time to make their credit card payments. These rules must be implemented by July 1, 2010. While many of the provisions in the new rules are targeted at practices in which Capital One has not engaged, we anticipate that we will need to make significant changes to current account risk management strategies to address the new limitations these rules impose.  The Federal Reserve also amended Regulation Z on December 18, 2008 to change a number of disclosure and other obligations for credit cards. Among other things, the final rule requires changes to: (i) solicitation and application disclosures; (ii) account opening disclosures; (iii) periodic statements; (iv) disclosures regarding changes in terms; and (v) convenience check disclosures. These rules also must be implemented by July 1, 2010. The amendments will require substantial modifications to virtually all marketing and account management communications.  For a discussion of the risks posed to the Company as a result of these new regulations, please refer to “Compliance With New and Existing Laws and Regulations May Increase Our Costs, Limit Our Ability To Pursue Business Opportunities, And Increase Compliance Challenges” under Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Dividends and Transfers of Funds  Traditionally dividends to the Company from its direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for the Company to pay dividends on its stock, make payments on corporate debt securities and meet its other obligations. There are various federal and state law limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to the Company through dividends, loans or otherwise. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, federal and state banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, and general federal and state regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. In general, federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as the Banks, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards.  In the current economic environment, however, we expect that the Company may represent a major source of funds for its direct and indirect subsidiaries.  In addition, as a result of our participation in the U.S. Department of Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”), the Company must obtain the U.S. Treasury’s consent to increase dividends on its common stock. For additional information about the Company’s participation in the CPP, please refer to “U.S. Treasury Department’s Capital Purchase Program Participation”, under  V. Management Summary and Business Outlook, 2008 Summary of Significant Events.    11    Table of Contents Capital Adequacy  The Banks are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by federal banking regulators. For a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Adequacy” and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 21. The Banks were well capitalized under these guidelines as of December 31, 2008.  Basel II  Implementation of the international accord on revised risk-based capital rules known as “Basel II” continues to progress in the U.S. Federal banking regulators finalized the “Advanced” version of Basel II in December 2007 and they issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the “Standardized” version in June 2008. Neither version is mandatory for the Company, but the Advanced version could become so due to growth in reported assets. Alternatively, the Company might elect to comply with either the Advanced or Standardized versions of Basel II in the future. Application of the new capital rules could require us to increase the minimum level of capital that we hold. Compliance might also require a material investment of resources. We will continue to closely monitor regulators’ implementation of the new rules with respect to the large institutions that are subject to it and assess the likely eventual impact to us.  FDICIA  Among other things, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) requires federal bank regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” (“PCA”) with respect to insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital ratio levels: well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. As of December 31, 2008, each of the Banks met the requirements for a “well-capitalized” institution. The “well-capitalized” classification is determined solely for the purposes of applying FDICIA’s PCA provisions, as discussed below, and should not be viewed as describing the condition or future prospects of a depository institution, including the Banks. Were any of the Banks to lose their status as “well-capitalized” they could be required to increase capital or lose access to deposits.  Deposits and Deposit Insurance  Each of the Banks, as an insured depository institution, is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The DIF was formed March 31, 2006, upon the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Association Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the “Reform Act”). The Reform Act permits the FDIC to set a Designated Reserve Ratio (“DRR”) for the DIF. To maintain the DIF, member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium and the FDIC may take action to increase insurance premiums if the DRR falls below its required level.  The FDIC has issued rules increasing the assessment rates banks pay for deposit insurance in order to restore the deposit insurance fund. The final rules uniformly raised rates for the first quarter of 2009 by 7 basis points (7 cents for every $100 of deposits), on an annual basis, for all banks. The FDIC also issued proposed rules where future rates would be based on an institution’s risk, with riskier institutions bearing a greater share of the proposed increase. Final rules on the risk-based premium assessment are expected in the first quarter of 2009.  The FDIC is also authorized to terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding by the FDIC that the bank’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank’s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for a Bank could have a material adverse effect on its earnings.  The Banks may accept brokered deposits as part of their funding. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), as discussed in Section X. Capital, only “well-capitalized” and “adequately-capitalized” institutions may accept brokered deposits. Adequately-capitalized institutions, however, must first obtain a waiver from the FDIC before accepting brokered deposits, and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institution’s normal market area or the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity, as determined by the FDIC, for deposits from outside the institution’s normal market area.  FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program   On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (“TLGP”), which is comprised of the Debt Guarantee Program (“DGP”) and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (“TAGP”).  The TAGP provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage through December 31, 2009, for non-interest bearing transaction accounts (including accounts swept from a non-interest bearing transaction account into a non-interest bearing savings deposit account) and     12    Table of Contents  certain interest-bearing accounts (negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts with interest rates of 0.5 percent or less and lawyers trust accounts) at FDIC-insured depository institutions. Depository institutions participating in the TAGP will be assessed, on a quarterly basis, an annualized 10 basis points fee on the balance of each covered account in excess of the existing FDIC deposit insurance limit of $250,000 that was established on a temporary basis by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.  The DGP provides an FDIC guarantee of certain senior unsecured debt of FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies. The unsecured debt must be issued on or after October 14, 2008 and not later than October 31, 2009, and the guarantee is effective through the earlier of the maturity date or June 30, 2012. The DGP coverage limit is generally 125% of the eligible entity’s eligible debt outstanding on September 30, 2008 and scheduled to mature on or before June 30, 2009 or, for certain insured institutions, 2% of their liabilities as of September 30, 2008. The proceeds of debt guaranteed under the DGP may not be used to prepay debt that is not guaranteed by the FDIC. Depending on the term of the debt maturity, the nonrefundable DGP fee ranges from 50 to 100 basis points (annualized) for covered debt outstanding until the earlier of maturity or June 30, 2012.  The TAGP and DGP are in effect for all eligible entities, unless the entity opted out on or before December 5, 2008. COBNA and CONA are participating in the TAGP. The Corporation, COBNA and CONA remain eligible to participate although the Company has not chosen to issue any debt under the program in the DGP.  Liability for Commonly-Controlled Institutions  Under the “cross-guarantee” provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (“FIRREA”), insured depository institutions such as the Banks may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or FDIC assistance to, any commonly controlled insured depository institution. The Banks are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision.  Subprime Lending Guidelines  On January 31, 2001, the federal banking agencies issued “Expanded Guidance for Subprime Lending Programs” (the “Guidelines”). The Guidelines, while not constituting a formal regulation, provide guidance to the federal bank examiners regarding the adequacy of capital and loan loss reserves held by insured depository institutions engaged in “subprime” lending. The Guidelines adopted a broad definition of “subprime” loans which likely covers more than one-third of all consumers in the United States. Because our business strategy is to provide credit card products and other consumer loans to a wide range of consumers, we believe that a portion of our loan assets are viewed by the examiners as “subprime.” Thus, under the Guidelines, bank examiners could require COBNA to hold additional capital (from one and one-half to three times the minimally required level of capital, as set forth in the Guidelines), or additional loan loss reserves, against such assets. As described above, as of December 31, 2008 COBNA met the requirements for a “well-capitalized” institution. Federal examiners, however, have wide discretion as to how to apply the Guidelines and there can be no assurances that COBNA or CONA may not be required to hold additional regulatory capital against such assets.  For purposes of the Guidelines, we treat as “subprime” all loans in COBNA’s programs that are targeted at customers either with a Fair, Isaac and Company (“FICO”) score of 660 or below or with no FICO score. COBNA holds on average 200% of the total risk-based capital requirement that would otherwise apply to such assets.  FFIEC Account Management Guidance  On January 8, 2003, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) released Account Management and Loss Allowance Guidance (the “Guidance”). The Guidance applies to all credit lending of regulated financial institutions and generally requires that banks properly manage several elements of their lending programs, including line assignments, over-limit practices, minimum payment and negative amortization, workout and settlement programs, and the accounting methodology used for various assets and income items related to loans.  We believe that our account management and loss allowance practices are prudent and appropriate and, therefore, consistent with the Guidance. We caution, however, that similar to the subprime Guidelines, the Guidance provides wide discretion to bank regulatory agencies in the application of the Guidance to any particular institution and its account management and loss allowance practices. Accordingly, under the Guidance, bank examiners could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future, and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.  OCC Minimum Payment Rules  Shortly after conversion of COBNA to a national association, COBNA implemented minimum payment requirements established by the OCC for the credit card industry. The OCC’s minimum payment policies are designed to force modest positive amortization for all card accounts. Under the new policy, the monthly minimum payment is set at 1% of principal balance, plus all interest assessed in the prior cycle, plus any past due fees and certain other fees assessed in the prior cycle. This compares to the Company’s previous policy, which for most accounts is a flat 3% of principal balance. This has had the effect of increasing the minimum payment for delinquent customers, while lowering it for many customers who are current. Please refer to Section V, Management Summary and Business Outlook, for a discussion of the impact on the Company of compliance with this policy.    13    Table of Contents Privacy and Fair Credit Reporting  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”) requires a financial institution to describe in a privacy notice certain of its privacy and data collection practices and requires that customers or consumers, before their nonpublic personal information is shared with nonaffiliated third parties, be given a choice (through an opt-out notice) to limit the sharing of such information about them with nonaffiliated third persons unless the sharing is required or permitted under the GLBA as implemented. The Company and the Banks have written privacy notices that are available through the web site of the Company, the relevant legal entity, or both, and are delivered to consumers and customers when required under the GLBA. In accordance with the privacy notices noted above, the Company and the Banks protect the security of information about their customers, educate their employees about the importance of protecting customer privacy, and allow their customers to remove their names from the solicitation lists they use and share with others to the extent they use or share such lists. The Company and the Banks require business partners with whom they share such information to have adequate security safeguards and to abide by the redisclosure and reuse provisions of the GLBA. To the extent that the GLBA and the FCRA require the Company or one or more of the Banks to provide customers and consumers the opportunity to opt out of sharing information, then the relevant entity or entities provide such options in the privacy notice. In addition to adopting federal requirements regarding privacy, the GLBA also permits individual states to enact stricter laws relating to the use of customer information. To date, at least California, Vermont and North Dakota have done so by statute, regulation or referendum, and other states may consider proposals which impose additional requirements or restrictions on the Company and/or the Banks. If the federal or state regulators of the financial subsidiaries establish further guidelines for addressing customer privacy issues, the Company and/or one or more of the Banks may need to amend their privacy policies and adapt their internal procedures.  Like other lending institutions, the Banks utilize credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the FCRA on a uniform, nationwide basis, including credit reporting, prescreening, sharing of information between affiliates, and the use of credit data. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the “FACT Act”), which was enacted by Congress and signed into law in December 2003, extends the federal preemption of the FCRA permanently, although the law authorizes states to enact identity theft laws that are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the provisions of the FACT Act. If financial institutions and credit bureaus fail to alleviate the costs and consumer frustration associated with the growing crime of identity theft, financial institutions could face increased legislative/regulatory and litigation risks. In addition, federal regulators are still in the process of promulgating regulations under the FACT Act; there can be no assurance that such regulations, when enacted, will not have an adverse impact on us.  Investment in the Company and the Banks  Certain acquisitions of capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of capital stock of the Company in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. Each of the Banks is an “insured depository institution” within the meaning of the Change in Bank Control Act. Consequently, federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of the Corporation without, in most cases, prior written approval of the Federal Reserve or the OCC, as applicable. Control is conclusively presumed if, among other things, a person or company acquires more than 25% of any class of voting stock of the Company. A rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires more than 10% of any class of voting stock and is subject to any of a number of specified “control factors” as set forth in the applicable regulations. Additionally, COBNA and CONA are “bank” within the meaning of Chapter 13 of Title 6.1 of the Code of Virginia governing the acquisition of interests in Virginia financial institutions (the “Financial Institution Holding Company Act”). The Financial Institution Holding Company Act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring, or making any public offer to acquire, control of a Virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to, and receiving prior approval from, the Bureau of Financial Institutions.  Non-Bank Activities  The Company’s non-bank subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by various other federal and state authorities. Insurance agency subsidiaries are regulated by state insurance regulatory agencies in the states in which they operate. Capital One Agency LLC is a licensed insurance agency that is regulated by the New York State Insurance Department in its home state and by the state insurance regulatory agencies in the states in which it operates. Capital One Agency LLC provides both personal and business insurance services to retail and commercial clients.  Capital One Asset Management, LLC and Capital One Financial Advisors, LLC are registered investment advisers regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Capital One Asset Management provides investment advice to institutions, foundations and endowments, and high net worth individuals.    14    Table of Contents Capital One Investment Services, LLC and Capital One Southcoast Capital, Inc. are registered broker-dealers regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to, among other things, net capital rules designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under these rules, broker-dealers are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed necessary to meet their continuing commitments to customers and others, and are required to keep a substantial portion of their assets in relatively liquid form. These rules also limit the ability of broker-dealers to transfer large amounts of capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Broker-dealers are also subject to other regulations covering their business operations, including sales and trading practices, public offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.  USA PATRIOT Act of 2001  The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanisms for the U.S. government, including due diligence requirements for private banking and correspondent accounts; standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; reporting requirements applicable to the receipt of coins and currency of more than $10,000 in nonfinancial trades or businesses; and more broadly applicable suspicious activity reporting requirements.  The Department of Treasury in consultation with the Federal Reserve and other federal financial institution regulators has promulgated rules and regulations implementing the Patriot Act that prohibit correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks at U.S. financial institutions; require financial institutions to maintain certain records relating to correspondent accounts for foreign banks; require financial institutions to produce certain records upon request of the appropriate federal banking agency; require due diligence with respect to private banking and correspondent banking accounts; facilitate information sharing between government and financial institutions; require verification of customer identification; and require financial institutions to have an anti-money laundering program in place.  Interstate Taxation  Several states have passed legislation which attempts to tax the income from interstate financial activities, including credit cards, derived from accounts held by local state residents. The Company has accounted for this matter applying the recognition and measurement criteria of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, (“FIN 48”).  Legislation  Throughout 2007 and 2008, Congress introduced legislation focused on a number of areas related to Capital One’s businesses. During the same period, eleven Congressional hearings were held and numerous legislative proposals introduced on credit card practices. Legislation restricting credit card terms passed the U.S. House of Representatives in September 2008, but did not pass the U.S. Senate. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve Board issued final rules in December 2008 that address many of the same issues raised by legislators. See “Regulation of Lending Activities” in Item 1. Supervision and Regulation. The effective date of the regulations is July 1, 2010. Legislation has been introduced in Congress and may potentially be considered in both the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate in 2009 that would impact the implementation period of the Federal Reserve rules or extend limitations to additional practices.  In 2008, legislation was also introduced to regulate interchange fees. Several hearings were held, but the legislation was not considered by the full House or by the U.S. Senate. This issue is expected to continue to be debated in Congress in 2009 and also at the state level.  In 2008, Congress also focused on the housing market, looking at both retrospective and prospective solutions. In July 2008, legislation was enacted to create additional federal backstops and strengthen regulation of the Government Sponsored Enterprises (“GSEs”), including an overhaul of Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) programs. In October 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (“EESA”) was enacted, which, among other things, authorized the U. S. Treasury Department to create a $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program (“TARP”) originally created to address troubled mortgage assets. In November 2008, the Treasury approved the Company’s participation in one of the programs implemented under the EESA, the TARP Capital Purchase Program (the “CPP”). Treasury continues to refine the regulations implementing the CPP, and it is unclear at this time what its final form will be. Additional programs are also being created that utilize TARP monies such as the Federal Reserve’s Term Asset Loan Facility (“TALF”).  Under the EESA the Company is subject to increased Congressional scrutiny, including participating in Congressional hearings and investigations and providing reports to the Treasury Department and the Government Accountability Office (“GAO”) as well as other entities created under the EESA to provide additional oversight. Congress has shown a strong interest in directing how the monies and programs under the EESA are managed. To this end, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation addressing a number of terms of the EESA and a number of hearings have been scheduled. Recently Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”), which, among other things, includes additional restrictions for participants in programs under the EESA. Such restrictions include limitations on hiring workers under the H1-B visa program and compliance with new standards to be adopted by the U.S. Treasury relating to the executive compensation practices of participants in programs under the TARP. The ARRA also includes provisions that would allow the Company to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock that it issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP using proceeds other than those received from a “qualified equity offering” under certain circumstances and with regulator approval. In addition, it is expected that provisions related to mortgage loans and modifications are likely to be forthcoming. For additional information regarding the Company’s participation in the CPP please see Section V, Management Summary and Business Outlook, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 10.  Finally, there have been several proposals in Congress to modify the bankruptcy laws to permit homeowners at risk of foreclosure to modify their primary mortgages. On October 20, 2008, the President signed the “National Guard and Reservists Debt Relief Act of 2008,” making bankruptcy filings easier for national guardsmen and reservists. Broad bankruptcy legislation also has been introduced in 2009 that could be seen as creating incentives for consumers to choose Chapter 13 bankruptcy as a primary remedy for mortgage related problems, which could lead to an increase in bankruptcy filings. This legislation passed the U.S. House in February and now heads to the U.S. Senate for possible consideration.  Please see “Compliance With New and Existing Laws and Regulations May Increase Our Costs, Limit Our Ability To Pursue Business Opportunities, And Increase Compliance Challenges” under Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks posed to the Company as a result of the current legislative environment.    15    Table of Contents Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance  On July 30, 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) was passed into law. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies to all companies that are required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and contains a number of significant changes relating to the responsibilities of directors and officers and reporting and governance obligations of SEC reporting companies. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”), a private sector, non-profit corporation whose mission is to oversee the auditors of public companies. The PCAOB recommends rulemaking to the SEC and sets certain standards for the auditors which it oversees. Since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have taken a variety of steps that we believe place us in substantial compliance with the effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We continue to monitor SEC rulemaking and PCAOB activities to determine if additional changes are needed to comply with provisions that may become effective in the future. Furthermore, our management has supervised the design of, or has designed, internal controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information regarding the Company is made known to them, particularly during the period in which this Annual Report on Form 10-K is being prepared and has evaluated the effectiveness of those controls as more fully set forth in “Controls and Procedures” below. We have, in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, certified, in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that we did not discover, during the execution of our internal control processes, any material weaknesses. In addition, our management policy is to disclose to our auditors and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors significant deficiencies, if any, in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, as well as any fraud, whether or not material, by those that have a significant role in these processes.  Regulation of International Business by Non - U.S. Authorities  COBNA faces regulation in foreign jurisdictions where it currently operates. In the United Kingdom, COBNA operates through the U.K. Bank, which was established in 2000. The U.K. Bank is regulated by the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) and licensed by the Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”). The U.K. Bank is an “authorized deposit taker” and thus is able to take consumer deposits in the U.K. The U.K. Bank also has been granted a full license by the OFT to issue consumer credit under the U.K.’s Consumer Credit Act. The FSA requires the U.K. Bank to maintain certain regulatory capital ratios at all times, and it may modify those requirements at any time. Effective January 1, 2008, the U.K. Bank has become subject to new capital adequacy requirements implemented by the FSA as a result of the U.K.’s adoption of the European Capital Requirements Directive, itself an implementation of the Basel II Accord. The U.K. Bank obtains capital through earnings or through additional capital infusion from COBNA, subject to approval under Regulation K of the rules administered by the Federal Reserve. If the U.K. Bank is unable to generate or maintain sufficient capital on favorable terms, it may choose to restrict its growth to reduce the regulatory capital required. Following the introduction of the Capital Requirements Directive, the U.K. Bank continues to have a capital surplus and the impact of the new capital regime has been fully factored into the U.K. Bank’s financial and capital planning. In addition, the U.K. Bank is limited by the U.K. Companies Act in its distribution of dividends to COBNA in that dividends may only be paid out of the U.K. Bank’s “distributable profits.”  As in the U.S., in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we operate, we face a risk that the laws and regulations that are applicable to us (or the interpretations of existing laws by relevant regulators) may change in ways that adversely impact our business.  The OFT is investigating Visa’s and MasterCard’s current methods of setting interchange fees applicable to U.K. domestic transactions. Cross-border interchange fees are also coming under scrutiny from the European Commission (“EC”), which in December 2007 issued a decision notice stating that MasterCard’s interchange fees applicable to cross border transactions are in breach of European Competition Law. MasterCard has appealed this decision. A similar decision is expected in relation to Visa’s cross border interchange fees. The timing of any final resolution of the matter by EC or OFT is uncertain and it is most unlikely that there will be any determination before the end of 2009. However, it is likely that interchange fees will be reduced, which could adversely affect the yield on U.K. credit card portfolios.    16    Table of Contents Following a referral by the OFT, the Competition Commission (“CC”) launched a market investigation into the supply of Payment Protection Insurance (“PPI”) in the U.K. PPI on mortgages, credit cards, unsecured loans (personal loans, motor loans and hire purchase) and secured loans are included. The CC published its final report on remedies on January 29, 2009, which included point of sale changes and the introduction of an annual PPI statement to customers. All changes will take effect in 2010. The U.K. Bank will likely see an increase in customer cancellations and complaints beginning in 2009, and will stop selling PPI to new customers in 2010. The U.K. Bank continues to consider alternative products to help mitigate these impacts.  Following the change in the U.S. regulator of COBNA in 2008 to the OCC, U.K. Bank has been included in various discovery examinations by the OCC. Following their visit to the U.K. Bank in November 2008, the OCC has requested that all U.K. lenders which have a U.S. parent company amend the way in which they calculate the minimum monthly payment requested from customers. The new calculation goes beyond what is currently required of UK lenders under the Banking Code and other U.K. legislation, and therefore means that the U.K. Bank will be subject to additional regulation over and above its U.K. competitors who are not U.S. owned. The potential exists for further U.S. legislation to be selectively applied by the OCC to U.K. banks with U.S. parents.  The European Payment Services Directive (“PSD”) aims to harmonize the regulatory regime for payment services across the European Union (“E.U.”). The PSD, which is due to be implemented on November 1, 2009, sets minimum standards for payment services, including new information which must be provided to consumers and the introduction of new faster execution times for payment transactions. The PSD is intended to allow U.K. payment institutions to significantly expand their markets by offering their services across the E.U. It may encourage new entrants to the payment arena, in particular for mobile phone technology to be used to enable payments. The changes may also offer benefits to consumers by increasing competition in the market leading to lower prices and a wider choice of services. The final payment services regulations have not been issued, but the U.K. Bank is exploring its impact given the short time frame for implementation.  Statistical Information  The statistical information required by Item 1 can be found in Item 6 “Selected Financial Data”, Item 7 “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.      Item 1A. Risk Factors   This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We also may make written or oral forward-looking statements in our periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Forms 10-Q and 8-K, in our annual report to shareholders, in our proxy statements, in our offering circulars and prospectuses, in press releases and other written materials and in statements made by our officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not about historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, information relating to our future earnings per share, growth in managed loans outstanding, product mix, segment growth, tangible common equity, managed revenue margin, funding costs, operations costs, employment growth, marketing expense, delinquencies and charge-offs. Forward looking statements also include statements using words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “hope,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “estimate” or similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including the risks discussed below. Our future performance and actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond our ability to control or predict. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  This section highlights specific risks that could affect our business. Although we have tried to discuss all material risks, please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, among the other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements are the following:  The Current Business Environment, Including the Current Economic Downturn, May Adversely Affect Our Industry, Business, Results Of Operations And Capital Levels   The current global recession has resulted in a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, reduced asset values (including residential and commercial properties), reduced business profits, increased rates of business and consumer delinquency, and increased rates of consumer bankruptcy, some of which have had a negative impact on our results of operation. Continued economic weakness may hurt our financial performance as customers default on their loans or maintain lower deposit levels, or in the case of credit card accounts, carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity. A prolonged global recession could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.    17    Table of Contents Furthermore, dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities, in turn, have caused many financial institutions to turn to the government for extraordinary financial assistance, to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of credit counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or eliminated their funding to even the most credit-worthy borrowers or to other financial institutions. The resulting lack of available credit and lack of confidence in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our access to capital and financial condition.  In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:        •    Market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause declines in credit card usage and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.        •    The processes we use to estimate inherent losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation, which could have a negative impact on our business.        •    Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the criteria and/or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses, which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations.        •    Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in securitization or unsecured funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, which could limit our access to funding. As a result of these current market conditions, we have increased our reliance on deposit funding. This shift results in higher levels of owned loan receivables and related increases in our allowance for loan and lease losses.        •    Increased charge-offs, rising LIBOR and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled or increase certain capital requirements, which could accelerate our need for additional funding or have a significant effect on the ability of certain of our business entities to meet capital adequacy requirements.        •    An inability to accept or maintain deposits or to obtain other sources of funding could materially effect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business. Many other financial institutions are increasing their reliance on deposit funding, including newly formed bank holding companies and, as such, we expect increased competition in the deposit markets. We cannot predict how this increased competition will affect our costs. If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted. In addition, our ability to maintain existing or obtain additional deposits may be impacted by factors beyond our control, including perceptions about our financial strength, which could lead to consumers choosing not to make deposits with us.        •    Regulators, rating agencies or investors could change their standards regarding appropriate capital levels for banks in general or our company in particular. If we are unable to meet any such new standards, it could have negative impacts on our ability to lend, to grow deposits, and on our business results.        •    Increased prepayments, refinancings or other factors could lead to a reduction in the value of our mortgage servicing rights, which could have a negative impact on our financial results.  Compliance With New And Existing Laws And Regulations May Increase Our Costs, Limit Our Ability To Pursue Business Opportunities, And Increase Compliance Challenges  There has been increased legislation and regulation with respect to the financial services industry in recent months, and we expect that oversight of our business will continue to expand in scope and complexity. A wide array of banking, consumer lending, and deposit laws apply to almost every aspect of our business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.  Our participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program (the “CPP”) subjects us to increased oversight by the Treasury Department, regulators and Congress under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”). Congress may adopt further legislation to refine EESA in addition to other efforts to change lending practices that legislators believe led to the current economic situation. Such legislation could increase governmental oversight of the Company, restrict the Company’s lending or governance practices, or both, all of which could negatively impact our business and revenues.    18    Table of Contents In addition, the Federal Reserve Board recently passed amendments to Regulation AA (Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices) and Regulation Z (Truth in Lending), effective July 1, 2010, which limit or prohibit certain credit card practices and require increased disclosures for consumers. Although the Company has not engaged in many of the practices prohibited by the amendments, the rules could have a material adverse effect on future revenues in our U.S. credit card business and could make the card business generally less resilient in future economic downturns. In particular, the rules will prohibit an increase in the interest rates applied to existing credit card balances except in limited circumstances. Likewise, several bills pending before Congress could impact credit card pricing and other terms.  In addition, legislation has been introduced that could enable merchants to negotiate interchange fees, which is the discount on the payment due from the card-issuing bank to the merchant bank through the interchange network. The future of these bills is uncertain, but each, or additional legislation, could be introduced or reintroduced in 2009. We face similar risks with respect to our international businesses, where changing laws and regulations may have an adverse impact on our results.  In April 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) voted to eliminate Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (“QSPEs”) from the guidance in SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. This change could have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements because the Company could lose sales treatment for assets previously sold to a QSPE, as well as for future sales. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $45.9 billion of credit card receivables held by QSPEs. If the Company is required to hold more of these assets on its balance sheet, the Company could be required to comply with increased regulatory capital requirements and such capital may not be available on terms favorable to the Company, if at all. If the Company were to fail to comply with any additional capital requirements, it could have a negative impact on our business. Likewise, if the Company is required to hold additional assets on its balance sheet, the Company may also have to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses to account for potential losses with respect to such assets. If the Company were to increase its allowance for loan and lease losses, it could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results.  Finally, in January 2009, broad bankruptcy legislation was introduced in Congress that could be seen as creating incentives for consumers to choose Chapter 13 bankruptcy as a primary remedy for mortgage related problems. Such legislation, if enacted, could result in an increase in bankruptcy filings, which could lead to increased credit losses in certain of our other lending businesses, such as credit cards and auto finance, and could have an overall negative impact on our results of operation.  Laws and regulations, and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto, generally are intended to benefit consumers, borrowers and depositors, not shareholders. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our earnings and growth. In addition, some of these new laws and regulations may increase our costs. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations. For a description of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, please refer to Supervision and Regulation in Item 1.  The Capital Markets And Credit Environment Have Experienced Unprecedented Levels Of Volatility, Which Could Have A Negative Impact On Our Business  The capital markets have experienced and are continuing to experience extended volatility and disruption, which has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock price and credit capacity for issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. Such market conditions may limit the Company’s ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the capital necessary to maintain and grow our business. As such, the Company may be forced to delay raising capital or bear an unattractive cost of capital, which could limit financial flexibility and ultimately jeopardize its overall liquidity and capital position. In the event the Company needs to preserve its capital levels or raise additional capital, the current level of dividends paid to shareholders may decrease and the price at which additional capital may be raised could be dilutive to existing shareholders.  Similarly, as a result of the extreme dislocation in the marketplace, the market value of assets in the Company’s investment portfolio has declined, and such decline may be lasting or could become even more severe. Such decline has increased and could continue to increase the Company’s unrealized losses, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s capital position.  In response to this market dislocation, the federal government has taken unprecedented government action, including the various programs implemented by the U.S. Treasury to inject capital into the financial system. However, there is no guarantee that the Treasury’s programs will necessarily benefit the financial markets in general or the Company in particular. In addition, the Company could also be adversely impacted if certain of its competitors are beneficiaries of certain of the government’s programs and the Company does not receive comparable assistance. The government may not continue to intervene in the financial markets, and any governmental intervention may not have a positive impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.    19    Table of Contents We May Experience Increased Delinquencies And Credit Losses  Like other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans. Rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses (such as higher delinquencies, non-performing loans, or bankruptcy rates; lower collateral values; rising unemployment rates) may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses. In particular, we face the following risks in this area:        •    Missed Payments. Our customers may miss payments. Loan charge-offs (including from bankruptcies) are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition. Our reported delinquency levels measure these trends. Customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn. In addition, we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change (i.e. an increased unwillingness or inability to repay debt), causing a long-term rise in delinquencies and charge-offs.        •    Estimates of inherent losses. The credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation. We may underestimate our inherent losses and fail to hold a loan loss allowance sufficient to account for these losses. Incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimates of inherent losses and inadequate allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, our estimate of inherent losses impacts the amount of allowances we build to account for those losses. The increase or release of allowances impacts our current financial results.        •    Underwriting. Our ability to assess the credit worthiness of our customers may diminish. If the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge-offs (due, for example, to rapid changes in the economy, including the unemployment rate), our credit losses and returns may deteriorate.        •    Business mix. Our business mix could change in ways that could adversely affect credit losses. We participate in a mix of businesses with a broad range of credit loss characteristics. Consequently, changes in our business mix may change our charge-off rate.        •    Charge-off recognition. The rules governing charge-off recognition could change. We record charge-offs according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules, including the FFIEC Account Management Guidance, could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices and cause our charge-offs to increase for reasons unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.        •    Mortgage repurchases. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we sell to investors in the event that there was improper underwriting or fraud, or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated. Typically, loans are put back to originators if they experience delinquencies. Consequently, we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans. We hold a reserve against this risk, but the reserve may not be adequate.        •    Industry practices. Our charge-off and delinquency rates may be negatively impacted by industry developments, including new regulations applicable to our industry.        •    Collateral. Collateral, when we have it, could be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses. When customers default on their loans and we have collateral, we attempt to seize it. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers. Particularly with respect to our commercial lending and mortgage activities, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans and investments. Thus, the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans.        •    New York Concentration. Although our lending is geographically diversified, in general, our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. The regional economic conditions in the New York area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A prolonged decline in the general economic conditions in the New York region could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations.  The Soundness of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us  Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the stability and actions of other financial services institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We     20    Table of Contents  have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients, resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  Likewise, adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of our competitors or the financial services industry as a whole could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments. In addition, adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships also could negatively impact perceptions about us. These negative perceptions about us could cause our business to suffer and exacerbate the other risks that we face.  Reputational Risk And Social Factors May Impact Our Results  Our ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our business practices and/or our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer, commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Particularly, negative perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us.  In addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by accountholders and borrowers domestically and internationally. These social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, the public’s perception regarding consumer debt, including credit card use, and changing attitudes about the stigma of personal bankruptcy. If consumers develop negative attitudes about incurring debt or if consumption trends continue to decline, our business and financial results will suffer.  Goodwill Impairment Could Negatively Impact Our Net Income And Stockholders’ Equity  Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount, which could lead to the measurement and recognition of goodwill impairment. These risks include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, the loss of key personnel, a more-likely-than-not expectation that all or a significant portion of a reporting unit may be disposed of, failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, a sustained decline in the Company’s market capitalization, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, and lowered expectations of future financial results. The Company recorded $810.9 million of goodwill impairment in 2008, and as of December 31, 2008, had approximately $12.0 billion of goodwill remaining on its balance sheet. Declines in the Company’s market capitalization increase the risk of further goodwill impairment in 2009.  We Face Intense Competition in All of Our Markets  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify. In such a competitive environment, we may lose entire accounts, or may lose account balances, to competing financial institutions, or find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base. Customer attrition from any or all of our lending products, together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers, could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings. Similarly, customer attrition from our deposit products, in addition to an increase in rates and/or services that we may offer to retain those deposits, may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intensely with respect to most of our products. Some of our competitors may be substantially larger than we are, which may give those competitors advantages, including a more diversified product and customer base, the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers, operational efficiencies, more versatile technology platforms, broad-based local distribution capabilities, lower-cost funding, and larger existing branch networks. In addition, some of our competitors may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage.  Fluctuations In Market Interest Rates Or The Capital Markets Could Adversely Affect Our Revenue And Expense, The Value Of Assets And Obligations, Our Cost Of Capital Or Our Liquidity  Like other financial institutions, our business may be sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the financial markets. Changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us. First, we borrow money from other institutions and depositors, which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other earning assets.     21    Table of Contents  We earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors. Fluctuations in interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short term rates and long term rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate, may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings. In addition, interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may affect the rate of customer pre-payments for auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards. These changes can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio. Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us. These changes may require us to replace withdrawn balances with higher cost alternative sources of funding. In addition, changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio. Finally, such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing.  We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes. We take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments. We face the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and our earnings in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed.  See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Interest Rate Risk Management” for additional information.  We May Fail To Realize All Of The Anticipated Benefits Of Our Mergers And Acquisitions  Capital One has engaged in merger and acquisition activity over the past several years. If we are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of such mergers and acquisitions, including cost savings and other synergies, our business could suffer. In addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger or acquisition. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources. These integration matters may have an adverse effect on the Company during any transition period.  Our recent acquisitions also involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new areas and/or these new businesses. These new businesses change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and could react differently to economic and other external factors. We face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses and/or in these new markets.  We Face Risk Related To The Strength Of Our Operational, Technological And Organizational Infrastructure  Our ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure while we expand and as we integrate acquired businesses. Similar to other large corporations, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company and exposure to external events. We are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. From time to time, we may need to change or upgrade our technology infrastructure. We may experience disruption, and we may face additional exposure to these risks during the course of making such changes. In addition, as we acquire other institutions, we face additional challenges when integrating different operational platforms. Such integration efforts may be more disruptive to the business and/or more costly than we anticipate.  In some cases, we outsource the maintenance and development of our operational and technological functionality to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Any increase in the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties may increase our exposure to this risk.  In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use both to interface with our customers and to manage our internal financial and other systems. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones depends on the functionality of our technology systems. Our ability to develop and implement effective marketing campaigns also depends on our technology. Additionally, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on these infrastructures. Any disruptions or failures of our infrastructure or technology systems could cause us to be unable to market, manage and report on our products, services and financial results in a timely and accurate manner.    22    Table of Contents The Company’s Business Could Suffer If It Is Unable To Attract, Retain and Motivate Skilled Senior Leaders   The Company’s success depends, in large part, on its ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of the Company’s business. The executive compensation provisions of the EESA, including amendments to such provisions implemented under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, are expected to limit the types of compensation arrangements that the Company may enter into with its most senior leaders upon adoption of implementing standards by the U.S. Treasury These standards, and any further legislation or regulation restricting executive compensation could have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate such leaders in support of the Company’s long-term strategy. In addition, many of the companies with which the Company competes for senior talent may not be subject to such compensation limitations. If we are unable to retain talented senior leadership, our business could suffer.  Certain Of Our Businesses Are Subject To Increased Litigation Risks  Our credit card business is subject to increased litigation as a result of the structure of the credit card industry, and we face risks from the outcomes of such industry litigation. Substantial legal liability against the Company could have a material adverse financial effect or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. For a full description of the litigation risks that we face in connection with the structure of the credit card industry, please refer to Industry Litigation in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to the Financial Statements – Note 19.”  We Face The Risk Of Fluctuations In Our Expenses And Other Costs That May Hurt Our Financial Results  Our expenses and other costs, such as operating, labor and marketing expenses, directly affect our earnings results. In light of the extremely competitive environment in which we operate, and because the size and scale of many of our competitors provide them with increased operational efficiencies, it is important that we are able to successfully manage our expenses. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they may increase. Investments in infrastructure, which may be necessary to maintain a competitive business, may increase operational expenses in the short-run. As our business develops, changes or expands, additional expenses can arise from management of outsourced services, asset purchases, structural reorganization, a reevaluation of business strategies and/or expenses to comply with new or changing laws or regulations. Integration of acquired entities may also increase our expenses, and we may be less able to predict the operational expenses of newly acquired businesses. In addition, we face the risk that the benefits of the Company’s cost savings initiative may not be fully realized. If we are unable to successfully manage our expenses, our financial results will suffer.  We Face Risks From Unpredictable Catastrophic Events  Natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including terrorist attacks, may have a negative effect on our business and infrastructure, including our information technology systems. Due to our banking locations in Louisiana and Texas, we are exposed to hurricanes and related damage; in New York and New Jersey, severe winter weather could impact our operations. The impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  We Face Risks From The Use Of Estimates In Our Financial Statements  Pursuant to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“US GAAP”), we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If the assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience unexpected material losses. For a discussion of how we use estimates in accordance with US GAAP, please refer to Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to the Financial Statements – Note 1.”      Item 1B.
