Item 1A. Risk Factors.”      EMPLOYEES    A central part of our philosophy is to attract and retain a highly capable staff. We had 31,542 employees, whom we refer to as “associates,” as of December 31, 2011. None of our associates are covered under a collective bargaining agreement, and management considers our employee relations to be satisfactory.      ADDITIONAL INFORMATION    Geographic Diversity  Our consumer loan portfolios, including credit cards, are diversified across the United States with modest concentration in California, Texas, New York, Florida, Louisiana and Illinois. We also have credit card loans in the U.K. and Canada. Our commercial loans are concentrated in New York, Texas, Louisiana and New Jersey. See “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile” and “Note 22—Significant Concentration of Credit Risk” for additional information.  Technology/Systems  We leverage information technology to achieve our business objectives and to develop and deliver products and services that satisfy our customers’ needs. A key part of our strategic focus is the development of efficient, flexible computer and operational systems to support complex marketing and account management strategies, the servicing of our customers, and the development of new and diversified products. We believe that the continued development and integration of these systems is an important part of our efforts to reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology services. Consequently, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements.  As part of our continuous efforts to review and improve our technologies, we may either develop such capabilities internally or rely on third party outsourcers who have the ability to deliver technology that is of higher quality, lower cost, or both. Over time, we have increasingly relied on third party outsourcers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure. These relationships include (but are not limited to): Total System Services Inc. (“TSYS”) for processing services for our North American and United Kingdom portfolios of consumer and small business credit card accounts, Fidelity National Information Services (“Fidelity”) for the Capital One banking systems and IBM Corporation for management of our North American data centers.    15    Table of Contents To protect our systems and technologies, we employ security, backup and recovery systems and generally require the same of our third-party service providers. In addition, we perform, or cause to be performed, a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms, systems and applications used to provide our products and services in an effort to ensure that any attacks on these platforms, systems and applications are unlikely to succeed. To date, to our knowledge, we have not been targeted with a direct, material cyber attack. We do not believe that the direct attacks we have seen have resulted in outside entities successfully penetrating our security controls.  Intellectual Property  As part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property, we rely on a variety of protections, including copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and certain restrictions on disclosure, solicitation, and competition. We also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization. Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information. In addition, our competitors and other third parties also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry. The ability of our competitors and other third parties to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete. Conversely, our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts, or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results.      FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    From time to time, we have made and will make forward-looking statements, including those that discuss, among other things, strategies, goals, outlook or other non-historical matters; projections, revenues, income, expenses, capital measures, returns, accruals for claims in litigation and for other claims against us; earnings per share or other financial measures for us; future financial and operating results; our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions; the projected impact and benefits of the acquisition of ING Direct (the “ING Direct Transaction”) and the pending acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card business (the “HSBC Transaction” and, with the ING Direct Transaction, the “Transactions”); and the assumptions that underlie these matters.  To the extent that any such information is forward-looking, it is intended to fit within the safe harbor for forward-looking information provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements, including, among other things:        •    general economic and business conditions in the U.S., the U.K., Canada and our local markets, including conditions affecting employment levels, interest rates, consumer income and confidence, spending and savings that may affect consumer bankruptcies, defaults, charge-offs and deposit activity;        •    an increase or decrease in credit losses (including increases due to a worsening of general economic conditions in the credit environment);        •    the possibility that regulatory and other approvals and conditions to the HSBC Transaction are not obtained or satisfied on a timely basis or at all;        •    the possibility that modifications to the terms of the HSBC Transaction may be required in order to obtain or satisfy such approvals or conditions;        •    the possibility that we will not receive third-party consents necessary to fully realize the anticipated benefits of the HSBC Transaction;        •    the possibility that we may not fully realize the projected cost savings and other projected benefits of the Transactions;    16    Table of Contents     •    changes in the anticipated timing for closing the HSBC Transaction;        •    difficulties and delays in integrating the assets and businesses acquired in the Transactions;        •    business disruption during the pendency of or following the Transactions;        •    diversion of management time on issues related to the Transactions, including integration of the assets and businesses acquired;        •    reputational risks and the reaction of customers and counterparties to the Transactions;        •    disruptions relating to the Transactions negatively impacting our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees and suppliers;        •    changes in asset quality and credit risk as a result of the Transactions;        •    the accuracy of estimates and assumptions we use to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Transactions, and the potential for our estimates or assumptions to change as additional information becomes available and we complete the accounting analysis of the Transactions;        •    financial, legal, regulatory, tax or accounting changes or actions, including the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder;        •    developments, changes or actions relating to any litigation matter involving us;        •    the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth;        •    increases or decreases in interest rates;        •    our ability to access the capital markets at attractive rates and terms to capitalize and fund our operations and future growth;        •    the success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers;        •    increases or decreases in our aggregate loan balances or the number of customers and the growth rate and composition thereof, including increases or decreases resulting from factors such as shifting product mix, amount of actual marketing expenses we incur and attrition of loan balances;        •    the level of future repurchase or indemnification requests we may receive, the actual future performance of mortgage loans relating to such requests, the success rates of claimants against us, any developments in litigation and the actual recoveries we may make on any collateral relating to claims against us;        •    the amount and rate of deposit growth;        •    changes in the reputation of or expectations regarding the financial services industry or us with respect to practices, products or financial condition;        •    any significant disruption in our operations or technology platform;        •    our ability to maintain a compliance infrastructure suitable for our size and complexity;        •    our ability to control costs;        •    the amount of, and rate of growth in, our expenses as our business develops or changes or as it expands into new market areas;        •    our ability to execute on our strategic and operational plans;        •    any significant disruption of, or loss of public confidence in, the United States Mail service affecting our response rates and consumer payments;        •    our ability to recruit and retain experienced personnel to assist in the management and operations of new products and services;        •    changes in the labor and employment markets;        •    fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners;        •    competition from providers of products and services that compete with our businesses; and    17    Table of Contents     •    other risk factors listed from time to time in reports that we file with the SEC.  Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made or as of the date indicated, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should carefully consider the factors discussed above in evaluating these forward-looking statements. For additional information on factors that could materially influence forward-looking statements included in this Report, see the risk factors set forth under “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Item 1A. Risk Factors  Business Risks  This section highlights specific risks that could affect our business. Although we have tried to discuss all material risks of which we are aware at the time this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been filed, other risks may prove to be important in the future, including those that are not currently ascertainable. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements include:  The Current Business Environment, Including A Slow or Delayed Economic Recovery, May Adversely Affect Our Industry, Business, Results Of Operations And Capital Levels.  The recent global recession resulted in a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, reduced asset values (including commercial properties), sharp and prolonged declines in residential home values and sales volumes, reduced business profits, increased rates of business and consumer repayment delinquency, increased rates of business and consumer bankruptcy, and increased and prolonged unemployment, some of which have had a negative impact on our results of operation. Although the overall economic recovery seems to be underway, it has remained modest and fragile. A recovery that is only shallow and very gradual, marked by continued elevated unemployment rates and reduced home prices, or another downturn, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans or maintain lower deposit levels or, in the case of credit card accounts, carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity.  In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events:        •    Adverse macroeconomic conditions may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, changes in consumer behavior, including decreased consumer spending and a shift in consumer payment behavior towards avoiding late fees, over-limit fees, finance charges and other fees, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.        •    Increases in bankruptcies could cause increases in our charge-off rates, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.        •    Our ability to recover debt that we have previously charged-off may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.        •    The processes and models we use to estimate inherent losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments, including assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation in an unpredictable economic environment, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.        •    Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses, which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations.    18    Table of Contents     •    Significant concern regarding the creditworthiness of some of the governments in Europe has contributed to volatility in the financial markets and led to greater economic uncertainty worldwide. Sovereign debt concerns in Europe could diminish economic recovery and lead to further stress in the financial markets, both globally and in the United States, which could have a negative impact on our financial results.        •    Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, which could limit our access to funding. The interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by, among other things, applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets, increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Increased charge-offs, rising LIBOR and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled, which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources.        •    We have increased our reliance on deposit funding over the past several years, in particular with the acquisition of ING Direct, and an inability to accept or maintain deposits or to obtain other sources of funding could materially affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business. Many other financial institutions have also increased their reliance on deposit funding and, as such, we expect continued competition in the deposit markets. We cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs. If we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.        •    Regulators, rating agencies or investors could change their standards regarding appropriate capital levels for banks in general or us in particular. If the new standards call for capital levels higher than the capital we have or that we anticipate, it could have negative impacts on our ability to lend or to grow deposits and on our business results.        •    Interest rates have remained at historically low levels for a prolonged period of time, and the flat yield curve associated with current interest rates generally leads to lower revenue and reduced margins because it limits our opportunity to increase the spread between asset yields and funding costs. The continued presence of a flat yield curve for a sustained period of time could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our net interest margin.        •    The historically low interest rate environment also increases our exposure to prepayment risk, particularly with respect to the originated mortgage portfolio we acquired from ING Direct. Increased prepayments, refinancing or other factors would reduce expected revenue associated with mortgage assets and could also lead to a reduction in the value of our mortgage servicing rights, which could have a negative impact on our financial results.  Compliance With New And Existing Laws And Regulations May Increase Our Costs, Reduce Our Revenue, Limit Our Ability To Pursue Business Opportunities, And Increase Compliance Challenges.  There has been increased legislation and regulation with respect to the financial services industry in the last few years, and we expect that oversight of our business will continue to expand in scope and complexity. A wide and increasing array of banking and consumer lending laws apply to almost every aspect of our business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership, and could result in negative publicity or damage to our reputation with regulators or the public. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.  In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the related rules and regulations adopted by various regulatory agencies, could have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act is a comprehensive financial reform act that requires, among other things, enhanced prudential standards (including capital and liquidity    19    Table of Contents  requirements), enhanced supervision (including stress testing), recovery and resolution planning (often referred to as “living wills”), prohibitions on proprietary trading and increased transparency and regulation of derivatives trading. The Dodd-Frank Act also provides heightened expectations for risk management and regulatory oversight of all aspects of large financial institutions, including us. Many aspects of the law remain to be implemented under the rulemaking and regulatory authority of the SEC, the CFTC and federal banking regulators. Although it is clear that the Dodd-Frank Act will materially impact large financial institutions like us, the ultimate effect and scope of that impact may not be understood for years. Though some aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act will clearly have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations, other aspects of the law may not apply to us. Nevertheless, the law will increase our need to build new compliance processes and infrastructure and to otherwise enhance our risk management throughout all aspects of our business. The cumulative impact will include higher expectations for capital and liquidity, as discussed in more detail below under the header “We May Not Be Able to Maintain Adequate Capital Levels or Liquidity, Which Could have a Negative Impact on Our Financial Results,” and higher operational costs once regulators fully implement the law. In addition, U.S. government agencies charged with adopting rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act may do so in an unforeseen manner, including ways that potentially expand the reach of the legislation more than as initially contemplated.  There are a number of other provisions in the Dodd-Frank act that will impact our business, including:        •    The Dodd-Frank Act created a new independent supervisory body, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) that became the primary regulator for federal consumer financial statutes on July 21, 2011. Rule writing authority for specified consumer financial statutes transferred to CFPB from other federal regulators. In addition, supervisory authority for consumer compliance over various institutions, including us, was transferred to the CFPB. State attorneys general will be authorized to enforce new regulations issued by the CFPB. Although state consumer financial laws will continue to be preempted under the National Bank Act under the existing standard set forth in the Supreme Court decision in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, OCC determinations of such preemption must be on a case-by-case basis, and courts reviewing the OCC’s preemption determinations will now consider the appropriateness of those determinations under a different standard of judicial review. As a result, state consumer financial laws enacted in the future that might previously have been preempted may be held to apply to our business activities. The cost of complying with these additional laws could have a negative impact on our financial results.        •    The Dodd-Frank Act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule and an interim final rule implementing the portion of the Dodd-Frank Act that limits interchange fees received by a debit card issuer. The final rule limits interchange fees per debit card transaction to $.21 plus five basis points of the transaction amount and provides, through the interim final rule, for an additional $.01 fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements. These rules will negatively impact revenue from our debit card business.        •    Under the Dodd-Frank Act, many trust preferred securities will cease to qualify for Tier 1 capital, subject to a three year phase-out period expected to begin in 2013. Also, the Dodd-Frank Act will most likely subject us to the supervision of regulatory agencies that historically have not regulated our businesses, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission with respect to our derivatives activities. These provisions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition by increasing our cost of funding, our cost of capital or our cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations.  The Credit CARD Act (amending the Truth-in-Lending Act) and related changes to Regulation Z impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees and also update the disclosures required for open-end credit. Overlimit fees may not be imposed without prior consent of the customer, and the number of such fees that can be charged for the same violation is constrained. The amount of any penalty fee or charge must be “reasonable and proportional” to the violation. In addition, the ability of a card issuer to increase rates charged    20    Table of Contents  on pre-existing card balances has been significantly restricted. Card issuers are generally prohibited from raising rates on pre-existing balances when generally prevailing interest rates change. Moreover, the circumstances under which a card issuer can raise the interest rate on pre-existing balances of a customer whose risk of default increases are restricted. As a result, the rules implementing the Credit CARD Act could make the card business generally less resilient in future economic downturns.  Under the various state and federal statutes and regulations, we are required to observe various data security and privacy-related requirements, including establishing information security and data security breach response programs and properly authenticating customers before processing or enabling certain types of transactions or interactions. Future federal and state legislation and regulation could further restrict how we collect, use, share and secure customer information. The failure to observe any one or more of these requirements could subject us to litigation or enforcement actions and impact some of our current or planned business initiatives.  Certain laws and regulations, and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto, may benefit consumers, borrowers and depositors, but not stockholders. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue, costs, earnings, growth and capital levels. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations. For a description of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, please refer to “Supervision and Regulation” in “Item 1. Business.”  We May Experience Increased Delinquencies And Credit Losses.  Like other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans. Rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses (such as higher delinquencies, higher rates of non-performing loans, higher bankruptcy rates, lower collateral values or elevated unemployment rates) may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses. In particular, we face the following risks in this area:        •    Missed Payments. Our customers may miss payments. Loan charge-offs (including from bankruptcies) are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition for our customers. Customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn or prolonged periods of slow economic growth. In addition, we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change (for example, an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customers to repay debt), causing a long-term rise in delinquencies and charge-offs.        •    Estimates of Inherent losses. The credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions. We may underestimate our inherent losses and fail to hold a loan loss allowance sufficient to account for these losses. Incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimates of inherent losses and inadequate allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, our estimate of inherent losses impacts the amount of allowances we build to account for those losses. In cases where we modify a loan, if the modifications do not perform as anticipated we may be required to build additional allowance on these loans. The increase or release of allowances impacts our current financial results.        •    Underwriting. Our ability to assess the credit worthiness of our customers may diminish. If the models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge-offs (due, for example, to rapid changes in the economy, including the unemployment rate), our credit losses may increase and our returns may deteriorate.        •    Business Mix. Our business mix could change in ways that could adversely affect credit losses. We engage in a diverse mix of businesses with a broad range of credit loss characteristics. Consequently, changes in our business mix may change our charge-off rate.    21    Table of Contents     •    Charge-off Recognition. The rules governing charge-off recognition could change. We record charge-offs according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules, including the FFIEC Account Management Guidance, could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices and cause our charge-offs to increase for reasons unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.        •    Industry Practices. Our charge-off and delinquency rates may be negatively impacted by industry developments, including new regulations applicable to our industry.        •    Collateral. Collateral, when we have it, could be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses. When customers default on their loans and we have collateral, we attempt to seize it where permissible and appropriate. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers. Particularly with respect to our commercial lending and home loan activities, decreases in real estate values adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans and investments. Thus, the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans. Borrowers may be less likely to continue making payments on loans if the value of the property used as collateral for the loan is less than what the borrower owes, even if the borrower is still financially able to make the payments.        •    New York Concentration. Although our lending is geographically diversified, approximately 48% of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the New York metropolitan area. The regional economic conditions in the New York area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. An economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in the New York region could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations.  We May Experience Increased Losses Associated With Mortgage Repurchases and Indemnification Obligations.  Certain of our subsidiaries, including GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”), Capital One Home Loans and Capital One, N.A., as successor to Chevy Chase Bank, may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that have been sold to investors in the event there are certain breaches of certain representations and warranties contained within the sales agreements. We may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we sell to investors in the event that there was improper underwriting or fraud or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated. These subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of representations and warranties and in various other circumstances, including securities fraud claims, and the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans. Consequently, we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans.  We have established reserves in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that are considered to be both probable and reasonably estimable related to the mortgage loans sold by our originating subsidiaries. The adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on, among other things, the actual future mortgage loan performance, the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests, the actual success rate of claimants, developments in litigation related to us and the industry, actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). Due to uncertainties relating to these factors, there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. For additional information related to our mortgage loan repurchase and indemnification obligations and related reserves and our estimate of the upper end of the reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond the current accrual levels as of December 31, 2011, see “Note 21—Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.”    22    Table of Contents We May Not Be Able to Maintain Adequate Capital Levels or Liquidity, Which Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Financial Results.  As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and international accords, financial institutions will become subject to new and increased capital and liquidity requirements. Although it is not yet clear what form these requirements will take or how they will apply to us, it is possible that we could be required to increase our capital levels above the levels in our current financial plans. These new requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances or make acquisitions and on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases. Higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity.  Recent developments in capital and liquidity requirements that may impact us include the following:        •    In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a final framework (commonly known as Basel III) on capital and liquidity. The key elements of the capital proposal include: raising the quality, consistency and transparency of the capital base; strengthening the risk coverage of the capital framework; introducing a leverage ratio that is different from the U.S. leverage ratio measures; promoting the build-up of capital buffers; and imposing a capital surcharge for global systemically important institutions. The liquidity framework includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision, one standard promoting short-term resilience and the other promoting longer-term resilience. How U.S. banking regulations will be modified to reflect these international standards remains unclear, particularly given the forthcoming capital and other prudential requirement regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act and the current Prompt Corrective Action framework. We expect, however, that minimum capital and liquidity requirements for us and other institutions will increase as a result of Basel III, the Dodd-Frank Act and related activity.        •    In November 2011, the Federal Reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us (commonly referred to as Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review or CCAR). Under the rules, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis and must obtain approval from the Federal Reserve before making most capital distributions. The purpose of the rules is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress. As part of its evaluation of a capital plan, the Federal Reserve will consider the comprehensiveness of the plan, the reasonableness of assumptions and analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy and the ability of the bank holding company to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a Tier 1 common ratio of 5% on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout a planning horizon of at least nine quarters.        •    Because we are a consolidated bank holding company with consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater, we are subject to certain heightened prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act, including requirements that may be recommended by the Financial Stability Oversight Council and implemented by the Federal Reserve. As a result, we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions, including risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits and liquidity requirements. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve released proposed rules beginning to implement the enhanced prudential requirements, including a detailed liquidity framework. If finalized as proposed, these requirements would increase our liquidity requirements and associated compliance and operational costs.        •    The Basel II final rules as implemented in the United States are mandatory for those institutions with consolidated total assets of $250 billion or more or consolidated total on-balance-sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion or more. We expect to become subject to these rules at the end of 2012 as a result of the acquisition of ING Direct. Prior to full implementation of the Basel II framework, organizations must complete a qualification period of four consecutive quarters, known as the parallel run, during which they must meet the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of their primary U.S. banking regulator. Based on current growth estimates, we would expect to enter parallel run January 1, 2015. This will require    23    Table of Contents       completing a written implementation plan and building processes and systems to comply with the rules. Compliance with the Basel II rules will require a material investment of resources. In addition, our current analysis suggests that our risk-weighted assets will increase under the Basel II framework, and therefore we would need to hold more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio.  See “Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” for additional information.  We Face Risk Related To Our Operational, Technological And Organizational Infrastructure.  Our ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire necessary operational, technological and organizational infrastructure. We are in the process of completing significant development projects to complete the systems integration of prior acquisitions and to build a scalable infrastructure in both our Retail Banking and Commercial Banking businesses. We anticipate making additional infrastructure changes and upgrades in connection with the integration of ING Direct and the pending acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card business. Our pending acquisition of the HSBC U.S. credit card business in particular involves the transfer of intellectual property, servicing platforms, infrastructure, contact centers and a significant number of employees. We expect that decoupling and transitioning these assets, infrastructure and systems from HSBC’s current systems and operations and integrating them into our own business operations will be a highly complex process. These infrastructure changes, upgrades and integrations may cause disruptions to our existing and acquired businesses, including, but not limited to, systems interruptions, transaction processing errors, interruptions to collection processes and system conversion delays, all of which could have a negative impact on us. In addition, we expect to enter into numerous transitional service arrangements with HSBC entities that will provide for services associated with the decoupling and transition of the business. Under these arrangements, HSBC will provide certain services to us and we will provide certain services to HSBC. These transitional service arrangements will continue for various dates until the separation of the business from HSBC is complete, and during that time we will rely on the ability of the applicable HSBC entities to provide these services. The complexities and requirements of these arrangements will increase the operational risk associated with the transition and integration of the business, and this increased risk could lead to unanticipated expenses, disruptions to our operations or other adverse consequences.  While we expect the pending acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card business will close in the second quarter of 2012, the complexities of the decoupling and transition could present risks of delay to our anticipated closing timing. Any significant delay in closing the acquisition could have a negative impact on our results of operations due to increased costs or a delay in our realization of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.  Similar to other large corporations, we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or persons outside of our company and exposure to external events. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use to manage our internal financial and other systems, interface with our customers and develop and implement effective marketing campaigns. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones and to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on the functionality and reliability of our operational and technology systems. Any disruptions or failures of our operational and technology systems, including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems, could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services or to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner, all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  In some cases, we and the businesses we are acquiring outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Any increase in the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties may increase our exposure to these risks.    24    Table of Contents In addition, our on-going investments in infrastructure, which may be necessary to maintain a competitive business, integrate newly acquired businesses such as ING Direct and HSBC’s U.S. credit card business and establish scalable operations, may increase our expenses. Further, as our business develops, changes or expands, additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies, management of outsourced services, asset purchases or other acquisitions, structural reorganization, compliance with new laws or regulations or the integration of newly acquired businesses. If we are unable to successfully manage our expenses, our financial results will be negatively affected.  We Could Incur Increased Costs or Reductions In Revenue Or Suffer Reputational Damage In the Event Of The Theft, Loss or Misuse Of Information, Including As A Result Of A Cyber-Attack.  Our products and services involve the gathering, storage and transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers and their accounts. Our ability to provide such products and services, many of which are web-based, relies upon the management and safeguarding of information, software, methodologies and business secrets. To provide these products and services, we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third party service providers operate. We also have arrangements in place with retail partners and other third parties where we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers. As a financial institution, we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws, regulations and guidance, as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs. If unauthorized persons were somehow to get access to personal, confidential or proprietary information, including customer information, in our possession or to our proprietary information, software, methodologies and business secrets, it could result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services that could adversely affect our business.  Information security risks for large financial institutions like us have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use computers, personal smartphones, tablet PC’s and other mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems. Although we believe we have a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers’ devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or other attacks that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers’ confidential, proprietary or other information, including their access credential to accounts with online functionality, or that could result in disruptions to the business operations of us or our customers or other third parties. Further, a breach or attack affecting one of our third-party service providers or partners could impact us through no fault of our own.  Because the methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack, disable, degrade or sabotage platforms, systems and applications change frequently and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have been launched, we and our third-party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures. Should a cyber-attack against us succeed on any material scale, market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, and we could face the aforementioned risks. Though we have insurance against some cyber-risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.  The Growth Of Our Online Banking Business Presents Certain Risks.  As a result of our strategic decisions and recent acquisitions, including ING Direct, we have grown our online banking business significantly over the past few years. Today, we operate one of the largest online banking    25    Table of Contents  businesses in the world, with over $128 billion in deposits as of December 31, 2011. While online banking represents a significant opportunity for customers in terms of greater and more flexible access to banking services at reduced costs, it also presents significant risks. In addition to the software, infrastructure and cyber-attack risks discussed above, we face risks related to online banking, including:        •    We face strong competition in the online banking market. Aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect the retention of existing balances and the cost-efficient acquisition of new deposit funds and may affect our growth and profitability. When general economic conditions improve, new competitors may forcefully enter the market and pursue a discount pricing strategy in order to attract loan origination volume, particularly if the new entrants target high quality loans. In addition, the effects of a competitive environment may be exacerbated by the flexibility of online banking and the increasing financial and technological sophistication of our customer base. Customers could close their online accounts or reduce balances or deposits in favor of products and services offered by competitors. These shifts, which could be rapid, could result from general dissatisfaction with our products or services, including concerns over pricing, online security or our reputation. For example, once we transition from the “ING Direct” brand for the online banking business we recently acquired, the new brand may not be as readily accepted by customers as we anticipate, and these customers may not accept our branding, image, name, reputation, policies or level of service or may be dissatisfied with perceived differences regarding how they manage their online accounts after the transition, and as a result may transfer their accounts and business to a competitor.        •    Our online businesses are dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk, particularly in the event of breakdowns or failures of such parties’ own systems. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our online banking businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which could result in a material adverse effect. We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, cyber-attacks, as discussed above, natural disasters, other damage to property or physical assets or events arising from local or larger scale politics, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to us.  We May Fail To Realize All Of The Anticipated Benefits Of Our Mergers And Acquisitions, Which Failure Could Result in Adverse Effects On Our Results Of Operations or Dilution Of Our Common Stockholders.  We have engaged in merger and acquisition activity over the past several years and may continue to engage in such activity in the future. We have explored, and expect to continue to explore, opportunities to acquire financial services companies and financial assets and to enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. For example, as described under “Recent Acquisition and Disposition Activity—ING Direct,” we announced the ING Direct acquisition in June 2011 and the acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card business in August 2011. In addition, we entered into credit card partnership agreements with, Kohl’s Corp., Sony Corporation and Hudson’s Bay Company during the past two years, including the acquisition of the related credit card loan portfolios, and we acquired Chevy Chase Bank in February 2009. We continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in, among other merger and acquisition activity, additional strategic partnerships and selected acquisitions of financial institutions and other financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios.  Any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake will entail certain risks, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. If we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership, including cost savings and other synergies, our business could be negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key    26    Table of Contents  employees, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources. These integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period.  In addition, we may face the following risks in connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership, including the ING Direct acquisition and the pending acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card businesses:        •    New Businesses and Geographic or Other Markets. Our merger, acquisition or strategic partnership activity may involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic areas or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new businesses or markets. These new businesses or markets may change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and could react differently to economic and other external factors. We face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses or in these new markets.        •    Identification and Assessment of Merger and Acquisition Targets and Deployment of Acquired Assets. We cannot assure you that we will identify or acquire suitable financial assets or institutions to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions or strategic partnerships. In addition, we may incorrectly assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we acquire. Further, our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership will depend on our ability to assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we partner with, merge with or acquire. We may be unable to profitably deploy any assets we acquire.        •    Regulatory Approval. Any future and pending merger or acquisition may be subject to regulatory or governmental approvals, which will require, among other things, review of our resulting financial condition, our ability to manage our resulting size, competitive considerations and our service to the community. We cannot assure you that we will receive any regulatory or governmental approvals. If such regulatory approvals of a merger or acquisition are not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties, delayed or failed implementation of our strategic objectives could result, including failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger or acquisition. In addition, governmental authorities from which approvals are typically required frequently have broad discretion in administering governing regulations. These governmental authorities may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our or another party’s business after the completion of merger or acquisition transaction.        •    Dilutive Issuances. We may issue common stock, other equity securities or debt in connection with future mergers and acquisitions, including in public offerings to fund such mergers and acquisitions or to provide adequate capital for the additional assets acquired. Issuances of our common stock, other equity securities or debt, whether as consideration for such mergers or acquisitions or to raise necessary funds or capital, may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and our common stockholders’ equity.        •    Accuracy of Assumptions. In connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership, we may make certain assumptions relating to the proposed merger or acquisition that may be, or may prove to be, inaccurate, including as the result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership. The inaccuracy of any assumptions we may make could result in unanticipated consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Assumptions we might make when considering a proposed merger, acquisition or strategic partnership may relate to numerous matters, including:        — projections of a target or partner company’s future net income and our earnings per share;        — our ability to issue equity and debt to complete any merger or acquisition;        — our expected capital structure and capital ratios after any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership;        — projections as to the amount of future loan losses in any target or partner company’s portfolio;    27    Table of Contents     — the amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership;        — certain purchase accounting adjustments that we expect will be recorded in our financial statements in connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership;        — cost, deposit, cross-selling and balance sheet synergies in connection with any merger, acquisition or strategic partnership;        — merger, acquisition or strategic partnership costs, including restructuring charges and transaction costs;        — our ability to maintain, develop and deepen relationships with customers of a target or partner company;        — our ability to grow a target or partner company’s customer deposits and manage a target or partner company’s assets and liabilities;        — higher than expected transaction and integration costs and unknown liabilities as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following any merger or acquisition transaction;        — the extent and nature of regulatory oversight over a target or partner company;        — projected or expected tax benefits or assets;        — accounting matters related to the target or partner company, including accuracy of assumptions and estimates used in preparation of financial statements such as those used to determine allowance for loan losses, fair value of certain assets and liabilities, securities impairment and realization of deferred tax assets;        — our expectations regarding macroeconomic conditions, including the unemployment rate, housing prices, the interest rate environment, the shape of the yield curve, inflation and other economic indicators; and other financial and strategic risks associated with any merger or acquisition.        •    Target Specific Risk. Assets and companies that we acquire will have their own risks that are specific to a particular asset or company. These risks include, but are not limited to, particular or specific regulatory, accounting, operational, reputational and industry risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Indemnification rights, if any, may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses or damages resulting from such risks. In addition to regulatory approvals discussed above, certain of our merger, acquisitions or partnership activity may require third-party consents in order for us to fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction.        •    Termination Fees. Termination of agreements relating to the acquisition of an entity or assets, or merger with another entity, may, under certain circumstances, result in termination fees that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  Reputational Risk and Social Factors May Impact Our Results.  Our ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our business practices or our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer, commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. In particular, negative perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us. Negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances, including lending practices, regulatory compliance, inadequate protection of customer information, or sales and marketing, and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct.    28    Table of Contents In addition, a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity, including credit card use, payment patterns and the rate of defaults by accountholders and borrowers domestically and internationally. These social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, the public’s perception regarding consumer debt, including credit card use, and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy. If consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt, or if consumption trends decline, our business and financial results will be negatively affected.  Damage To Our Brands Could Impact Our Financial Performance.  Our brands have historically been very important to us. As with many financial services institutions, maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and to continue to provide high-quality products and services. Negative public perception of our brands could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information, as well as from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our online banking brands may also be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including service outages, product malfunctions, data privacy, lack of training, security issues and integration difficulties from recent acquisitions.  We Face Intense Competition in All of Our Markets.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. We compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits and the rates and other terms we charge on the loans we originate or purchase, as well as the quality of our customer service. Price competition for loans might result in origination of fewer loans or earning less on our loans. We expect that competition will continue to increase with respect to most of our products. Some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, which may give those competitors advantages, including a more diversified product and customer base, the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers, operational efficiencies, more versatile technology platforms, broad-based local distribution capabilities, lower-cost funding and larger existing branch networks. In addition, some of our competitors are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage.  We have recently expanded our partnership business with the addition of Kohl’s, Hudson’s Bay Company and Sony, and we expect to add a significant number of partnerships with the pending acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card business. The market for key business partners, especially in the Card business, is very competitive, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources, time and expense in acquiring and developing the relationships. The loss of any of our business partners could have a negative impact on our results of operations, including lower returns, excess operating expense and excess funding capacity.  In such a competitive environment, we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms, or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base. Customer attrition from any or all of our lending products, together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers, could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings. Similarly, customer attrition from our deposit products, in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain those deposits, may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings.    29    Table of Contents If We Do Not Adjust to Rapid Changes in the Financial Services Industry, Our Financial Performance May Suffer.  Our ability to deliver to stockholders strong financial performance and returns on investment will depend in part on our ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of our customers. With our recent acquisition of ING Direct and our pending acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card business, we expect to market new products to our growing customer base. Our ability to sell more products to customers is a key part of our strategy to grow revenue and earnings. Many of our competitors are also focusing on cross-selling, which could limit our ability to execute our cross-sell strategy or require lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or offer higher interest rates on deposits, as well as affect our ability to maintain existing customers. This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers.  Fluctuations in Market Interest Rates Or Volatility in the Capital Markets Could Adversely Affect Our Revenue and Expense, the Value of Assets and Obligations, Our Cost of Capital or Our Liquidity.  Like other financial institutions, our business may be sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the capital markets. Changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us. For example, we borrow money from other institutions and depositors, which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other earning assets. We earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors. Fluctuations in interest rates, including changes in the relationship between short-term rates and long-term rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate, may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings. In addition, interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may affect the rate of customer prepayments for mortgage, auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards. These changes can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio. Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us. In addition, changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio. Finally, such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing.  We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes. We take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments. We face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed. See “MD&A—Market Risk Management” for additional information.  Our Business Could Be Negatively Affected If It Is Unable to Attract, Retain and Motivate Skilled Senior Leaders.  Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. The executive compensation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations issued thereunder, and any further legislation, regulation or regulatory guidance restricting executive compensation, may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract, retain and motivate such leaders in support of our long-term strategy. These laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions, and we therefore may face more restrictions than other institutions and companies with whom we compete for talent. If we are unable to retain talented senior leadership, our business could be negatively affected.    30    Table of Contents Our Businesses are Subject to the Risk of Increased Litigation.  Our businesses are subject to increased litigation risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry, the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry, the structure of the credit card industry and business practices in the mortgage lending business. Substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. For a description of the litigation risks that we face, see “Note 21—Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees.”  We Face Risks from Unpredictable Catastrophic Events.  Despite our substantial business contingency plans, the impact from natural disasters and other catastrophic events, including terrorist attacks, may have a negative effect on our business and infrastructure, including our information technology systems. The impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  We Face Risks from the Use of Estimates in Our Financial Statements.  Pursuant to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including, but not limited to, estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience unexpected material losses. For a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”  Our Ability To Receive Dividends From Our Subsidiaries Could Affect Our Liquidity And Ability To Pay Dividends.  We are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries. Dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries, have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common stock, make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations. There are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the Banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans. These limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements, federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates, as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices. If our subsidiaries’ earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, our liquidity may be affected and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common stockholders, to make payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations, each and any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or perception of financial health.  The Soundness of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us.  Our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the stability and actions of other financial services institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, servicing, counterparty and other relationships. With our recent acquisition of ING Direct and our pending acquisition of HSBC’s U.S. credit card businesses, we have exposure to increasing numbers of financial institutions and counterparties. These counterparties include institutions and counterparties that may be exposed to various risks over which we have little or no control, including European or U.S. sovereign debt that is currently or may become in the future subject to significant price pressure, rating agency downgrade or default risk.    31    Table of Contents In addition, we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients, resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  Likewise, adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of our competitors, the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate or sovereign debt could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments. In addition, adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships also could negatively impact perceptions about us. These perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face.  Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments
