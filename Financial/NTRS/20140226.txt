Item 1A—Risk Factors  From an investor’s standpoint, public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks. However, each company’s unique combination of strategies, markets served, product and service offerings, processes and systems, and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks. Following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business.    29    Table of Contents We explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings, as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise. You should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities, such as: reducing our capital, which can have regulatory and other consequences; affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us, with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses; and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so.  We identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls. If we fail to successfully identify and manage significant risks, we could incur financial loss. We may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably, or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive.  Economic, Market, and Monetary Policy Risks  Northern Trust carries on a global business. Changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions could adversely affect Northern Trust’s businesses. Factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices, the overall pace of capital markets activities, interest rates, currency exchange rates, investor sentiment and inflation or deflation can affect our results.        •   A downturn in economic conditions, such as the recent severe global economic downturn, can negatively affect our earnings.        •   Economic weakness can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans, causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit, a higher level of charge-offs, and higher provision for credit losses, all of which reduce our earnings.        •   Economic weakness can also reduce the fees we earn for managing and servicing our clients’ assets. For example, the recent downturn in equity markets and the decrease in the value of some debt-related investments as a result of market disruption or illiquidity reduce the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others. This reduces our earnings since a significant part of the fees we earn is based on asset values.        •   Weak economic conditions also affect wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which impact demand for our trust and investment products and services. Reduced transaction volumes would also negatively impact our earnings.        •   A slowing of the globalization of investment activity or pension reform could limit our revenue growth. We believe we have profited from the increasing globalization of investment activity and from pension reform in many nations that has generated new pools of assets that require management and servicing. Any slowing or reversal of this globalization of financial activity and markets or other such trends would adversely affect factors that have been important in Northern Trust’s growth.        •    Uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the EU, the increasing risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings. Risks and ongoing concerns about the debt crisis in Europe could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery, sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of European financial institutions. European market and economic disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt, and home prices. Continuing economic challenges in Europe and the related disruptions may negatively impact our earnings. See the    30    Table of Contents       section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management” in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 40-47).        •   Instability, disruption or a lack of confidence in the political, economic, legal or regulatory systems of the emerging markets in which we operate could expose us to liability or loss. Northern Trust’s expanding business activities in emerging markets, including investments made for clients in those markets, present risks inherent in conducting these activities in less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments.        •   Changes in interest rates can negatively affect our earnings. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Rates that remain persistently low may reduce our net interest margin, which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. A low interest rate environment can also reduce fees earned on certain of our products. For example, during 2009-2013, we waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of short-term interest rates. Lower net interest margins and fee waivers negatively impact our earnings. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Market Risk Management—Interest Rate Risk Management” in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 47-49).        •   Volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our earnings. Periods of lower foreign currency volatility can result in reduced foreign exchange trading income. We hold various non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and maintain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We also provide foreign exchange services to our clients, primarily in connection with our global custody business, and effect other transactions in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Foreign currency volatility and fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets, investments, and cash flows and raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions, where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other, or offset each other in different time periods. If the policies and procedures we have in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange volatility, including hedging-related strategies, are not followed or are not effective to mitigate such risks, our results and earnings may be negatively affected. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Market Risk Management—Foreign Currency Risk Management” in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 49-50).        •   Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can negatively affect our earnings. The value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions. Generally, the fair value of those securities is determined based upon market values available from third party sources. The recent period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption has negatively affected the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and asset-backed and auction rate securities in particular. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities results from declines in securities values that management determines to be other-than-temporary, the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Risk Management—Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management—Securities Portfolio” in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders (page 40) and “Note 4—Securities” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” (pages 75-79) in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information.        •    Changes in a number of particular market conditions can negatively affect our earnings. In past periods, reductions in the volatility of currency trading markets, the level of cross-border investing activity, or the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have negatively affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending. If these conditions occur in the future, our earnings from these activities may be negatively affected. In a few of our businesses, such    31    Table of Contents       as securities lending, our fee is calculated as a percentage of our client’s earnings, so that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues. The recent extraordinary market conditions have produced losses in some securities lending programs. Such market conditions also have reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs. A persistence or worsening of these conditions could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements—Variable Interests” in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders (page 32) and “Note 28—Variable Interest Entities” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” (pages 110-111) in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information.        •   Changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the United States, non-U.S. governments and international agencies can reduce our earnings and negatively affect our growth prospects. For example, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in interest rates and our cost of funds can negatively affect earnings. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board can reduce the value of financial instruments we hold. Its policies also can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available. This can increase the risk that they may fail to repay their loans from us.        •   Failure to develop and implement contingency plans to address market disruptions could adversely affect us. Our success in the area of highly complex asset servicing relationships depends, in part, on our development and successful implementation of contingency plans to address significant market disruptions caused by bankruptcy, insolvency or illiquidity. If we fail to develop or successfully implement contingency plans for these market disruptions, our results and business may be negatively affected.        •   Governmental action to combat economic weakness and financial market disruption may not succeed and may otherwise negatively affect us. Since mid-2008, there have been unprecedented disruptions in global financial markets, including volatility in asset values and constraints on the availability of credit. In response to these developments, the U.S. and other governments have taken steps designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular. The upheaval in global financial markets has accentuated each of the risks identified above and magnified their potential effect on Northern Trust. To the extent that these governmental stabilization and mitigation activities are not successful or adversely change the competitive structure of the financial services industry, these developments could have an adverse impact on Northern Trust’s revenues, costs, credit losses, access to capital, and liquidity. They also may impose additional limitations or costs on Northern Trust’s business.  Operational Risks        •   Errors, breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability, result in losses or negatively affect our earnings in other ways. In our asset servicing, investment management, fiduciary administration, and other business activities, Northern Trust effects or processes transactions for clients and for itself that involve very large amounts of money. Failure to properly manage or mitigate operational risks can have adverse consequences, and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses.        •   Many types of operational risks can negatively affect our earnings. Many factors can impact operations and expose us to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope, including:        •   Human errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures;    32    Table of Contents     •   Theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties;        •   Defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems;        •   Breakdowns in processes, including manual processes, which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes, over-reliance on manual processes, breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the technology and facilities that support our operations;        •   Unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades;        •   Defects in product design or delivery;        •   Difficulty in accurately pricing assets, which can be aggravated by increased asset coverage, market volatility and illiquidity, and lack of reliable pricing from vendors;        •   Negative developments in relationships with key counterparties, vendors, employees, or associates in our day-to-day operations; and        •   External events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, epidemics, computer viruses, geopolitical events, political unrest or acts of terrorism.        •   Our dependence on technology exposes us to risks that also can result in losses. Automated systems to record and process transactions, as well as to monitor positions and price assets, reduce the risk of human error, but our necessary dependence on such systems also increases the risk that system flaws or manipulation of those systems will result in losses. The failure to upgrade systems as necessary to support growth and changing business needs also could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business changes prior to and during introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to adequately align evolving client commitments and expectations with operational capabilities can have a negative impact on our operations.        •   Breaches of our security measures can result in losses. We rely heavily on information technology to conduct our business and any failure, interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations. Our systems involve the use of clients’ and Northern Trust’s proprietary information and security breaches, including cyber-attacks, could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access our clients’ proprietary information or our own proprietary information. For example, outside parties may attempt to use social engineering schemes, such as “phishing,” to manipulate employees or clients into disclosing sensitive information. Information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients.    33    Table of Contents     •   We may fail to detect errors resulting in losses that continue until the problems are detected and fixed. Given the high volume of transactions we process, errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected.        •   Our business continuity plans may not work and thus fail to prevent losses from operational failures. Our business continuity plans address many of these risks, but may not operate successfully to mitigate them. If they do not, we could incur losses, liability to clients or others and reduced earnings.        •   Inability of our internal controls to keep pace with our expansion may result in losses. In recent years, we have expanded our geographic footprint, product pipeline, and client types. A failure to put controls in place to mitigate new risks associated with this expansion may disrupt our operations, resulting in losses.        •   Failure of any of our third party vendors to perform can result in losses. Third party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have established risk management processes and continuity plans, any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could negatively affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense.        •   Northern Trust’s reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss or disclosure of our clients’ or our own information. Northern Trust makes extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. The secure maintenance and transmission of client information is a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit client information, or those of service providers or business partners, may be impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, Northern Trust’s clients’ information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without the clients’ consent. Any such loss, disclosure or access to, clients’ information can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses, operating results and financial condition.  These risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex, and as our increasingly international business requires end-to-end management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many inter-related products and services.  See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Market Risk Management—Operational Risk Management” in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 50-51).  Investment Performance, Fiduciary and Asset Servicing Risks  Revenues from our investment management, fiduciary, and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings.        •   Failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can negatively affect our earnings and growth prospects. If we do not generate competitive risk-adjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes, we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business, which would negatively affect our earnings and prospects.        •   If we fail to comply with legal standards, we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients, which could negatively affect our earnings. Managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction, which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses. Failure to comply with these standards, adequately manage these risks, or manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities could also result in liability.        •   We may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings. We may find it appropriate to take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings, liquidity or valuation issues or other developments, even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments. The risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted.    34    Table of Contents Credit Risks  A number of Northern Trust’s product offerings involve credit risk, which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us. These product offerings include loans, leases, derivatives, foreign exchange and other credit commitments.        •   Failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings. We evaluate credit commitments before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, including undrawn credit commitments. This process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments. Challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors. Allowances that prove to be inadequate can directly and negatively affect earnings.        •   Weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses, both of which reduce our earnings. Credit risk levels and our earnings can also be affected by the strength of the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers which could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans. For a fuller discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses for 2013, 2012, and 2011, see the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management” in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 40-47).        •   The failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss. The financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions, including banks, broker/dealers, collective investment funds and insurance companies. As a result of these interconnections, we and many of our clients have significant counterparty exposure to other financial institutions. This counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties (or in some cases of our clients’ counterparties) has the potential to expose us to risk of loss. The recent instability of the financial markets has resulted in many financial institutions becoming significantly less creditworthy, and as a result we are exposed to increased counterparty risks, both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients. Changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly, is often based upon a variety of factors and is difficult to predict. In addition, as U.S. and non-U.S. governments have addressed the financial crisis in an evolving manner, the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain. If a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us, we could incur financial losses that materially adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. Given the limited number of strong counterparties in the current market, we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients’ counterparty credit risk. The consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the concentration of our counterparty risk.    35    Table of Contents Liquidity Risks  Northern Trust depends on access to capital markets and short-term funding to provide sufficient capital resources and other funds to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients.        •   Many events or circumstances could adversely affect our capital costs, our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our ability to meet our commitments. Inadequate capital or the inability to meet our commitments could cause us to incur liability, restrict our ability to grow, or require us to take actions that would negatively affect our earnings. Among the developments that could have this effect are:        •   A loss of confidence of debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets generally or in transactions with Northern Trust;        •   Disruption in the market for debt-related securities; and        •   A significant downgrade of any of our debt ratings. Credit agencies’ ratings can change and they often adjust their methodology. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control, such as ratings agency-specific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types, which are subject to revision from time to time, and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. A significant downgrade in Northern Trust’s debt ratings could increase the costs and availability of short and long-term funding, negatively impacting our profitability and our ability to meet client needs.        •   Our success with large, complex clients requires substantial liquidity. Our failure to successfully manage these liquidity and balance sheet issues would have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow.        •   If the Bank or the other subsidiaries of the Corporation were unable to supply the Corporation with funds over time, the Corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations. The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. The Corporation relies primarily on dividends paid to it by the Bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the Corporation. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the other subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 32-39), including the discussion of the possible negative effects of a significant downgrade of any of the Corporation’s debt ratings (page 34).  Regulation Risks  Virtually every aspect of Northern Trust’s business around the world is regulated, generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. In the United States, the Corporation, the Bank, and many of the Corporation’s other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. These regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities. They are specifically directed at protecting depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by bank, securities and other regulators globally.    36    Table of Contents     •   Failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business, or that reduce earnings. Regulatory violations or failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties, require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business, result in limitations on our ability to conduct business, restrict our ability to expand, or adversely impact our reputation. Failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could adversely affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to various regulatory, governmental and enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us. In enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement, the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible.        •   The ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act may have a material effect on our operations. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made a number of significant regulatory and compliance changes, such as:        •   changes to the bank and bank holding company supervisory structure;        •   changes to regulatory capital requirements;        •   creation of new government regulatory agencies;        •   limitation and prohibition of certain activities by the Volcker Rule;        •   changes in insured depository institution regulations; and        •   mortgage loan origination and risk retention.  There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies, and the full extent of the impact of the requirements on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. For a more detailed description of the Dodd-Frank Act, see “Business—Regulation and Supervision—The Dodd-Frank Act.”        •   Changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings. The Dodd-Frank Act and the implementation of Basel III, have led to significantly higher capital requirements, higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios, and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities. The ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors, including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the U.S. banking regulators.        •    Compliance with evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies may impact us in ways that are difficult to predict. Laws, regulations, economic sanctions, and their interpretation by regulatory agencies may change or generate enhanced scrutiny of particular activities. Those changes or enhanced emphasis can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully. As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act will impose many new regulatory requirements on banking institutions, the full impacts of which are difficult to determine at this time. It is expected that additional legislative or regulatory requirements will continue to be imposed in the U.S. and in other countries, and existing legislative or regulatory requirements may be reinterpreted in the U.S. or in other countries, in each case in a way that may have an adverse impact on our business activities, our costs of    37    Table of Contents       compliance, and our revenues and earnings. Additionally, our understanding of legislative or regulatory requirements might be different than the enforcers’ understanding of the regulations. Moreover, many regulatory initiatives, including anti-money laundering rules, anti-bribery laws, home mortgage lending and loan modification requirements, and other regulatory requirements or priorities, could increase compliance costs and legal risks, and could lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation. While we have programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees. The full scope and impact of possible enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulation is uncertain and difficult to predict.        •   Potential additional regulation of money market mutual funds (MMMF) could lower the desirability of MMMFs for investors and reduce the profitability of MMMF sponsors. On June 5, 2013, the SEC issued a proposed rule regarding MMMF reform. The SEC proposal set forth two alternative methods of reform, either requiring MMMFs to transact at a “floating” net asset value per share or imposing a liquidity fee if a MMMF’s liquidity level fell below a specified threshold and permitting a fund to temporarily suspend redemptions. The comment period for these alternative proposals closed on September 17, 2013, and no final rule has been issued to date. Because of the uncertainty as to whether the SEC will issue final rules and what the final rules will require, the Corporation and the Bank cannot fully evaluate such reforms’ impact to their business at this time.        •   The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) policies on interest rates can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition. The FRB’s policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin. As a result of the FRB’s concerns regarding, among other things, continued slow economic growth and a weak housing market, the FRB recently indicated that it intends to keep the target range for the federal funds rate near zero until unemployment levels and inflation are under control. The FRB also may increase its purchases of U.S. government and mortgage-backed securities or take other actions in an effort to reduce or maintain low long-term interest rates.  See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Litigation Risks  Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them. Our trust, custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. This risk may be heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors are experiencing losses. In addition, as a publicly-held company, we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws, and volatility in the stock prices of Northern Trust and other financial institutions increases this risk.        •   Litigation can result in significant liability or damage to our reputation, which could result in a loss. Even where we defend ourselves successfully, the cost of litigation is often substantial. Even claims made against us without merit may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients, or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies, and stockholders, and so negatively affect our earnings.        •   We may fail to set aside adequate reserves or otherwise underestimate our liability, with a negative effect on our earnings. We estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims, and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to U.S. GAAP, by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations. This process is inherently subject to risk, including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case. Earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that our reserves are not adequate.    38    Table of Contents See “Note 24—Contingent Liabilities” in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” (pages 101-102) in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders for a discussion of current legal proceedings and litigation-related financial reserves.  Tax Risks  In the course of its business, Northern Trust is sometimes subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.        •   These challenges can result in reduced earnings in a number of ways. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings.        •   Changes in tax laws and interpretations can negatively affect our earnings. Both U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities from time to time issue new, or modify existing, tax laws and regulations. These authorities may also issue new, or modify existing, interpretations of those laws and regulations. These new laws, regulations or interpretations, and the Corporation’s actions taken in response to, or reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may impact the Corporation’s tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings.  Accounting Risks        •   Changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. New accounting standards, or changes to existing accounting standards, resulting both from initiatives of the Financial Accounting Standards Board or their convergence efforts with the International Accounting Standards Board, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, or bank regulatory agencies, or otherwise reflected in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods.  Strategic and Competitive Risks  We have grown through a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities, and we intend to continue to do so. A variety of risks could interfere with these plans.        •   If we do not successfully execute strategic plans, we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be negatively impacted. Our growth depends upon successful, consistent execution of our business strategies in each business unit. A failure to execute these strategies will negatively impact growth. A failure to grow organically or to successfully integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business. The challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees, clients, suppliers, and other business partners, delivering enhanced products and services, as well as combining accounting, data processing and internal control systems.        •   Failure to adequately control our costs could negatively affect our ability to compete and thus reduce our earnings. Our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results. Another goal of innovation, as a part of our business strategy, is to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses, including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets.    39    Table of Contents     •   Failure to attract and retain skilled people could negatively affect our prospects. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key talent. Competition for the best people in most of our activities can be intense and we may not be able to hire and retain key personnel, including as a result of any restrictions on our compensation practices that may be imposed by governments or regulators. The unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.        •   We face a variety of competitive challenges that could negatively affect our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings. We provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets, in which pricing can be a key competitive factor. Merger activity in the financial services industry, including mergers resulting from government intervention and the overall disruption in the financial services industry, continues to produce large, in some cases well-capitalized, and geographically-diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices. In certain businesses, such as foreign exchange trading, electronic networks present a competitive challenge. Additionally, technological advances and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business. Many of these non-traditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures. These competitive pressures can negatively affect earnings and our ability to grow.        •   Intervention of the U.S. and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face. In response to disruptions in global financial markets, the U.S. government and other governments around the world have taken, and may take further, unprecedented actions designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad powers to regulate consumer financial services and products and a Financial Stability Oversight Council with regulatory authority over certain financial companies and activities. Governments also may take actions to significantly change the way financial institutions are regulated, either through new legislation, new regulations, new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods. These actions may involve increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry. Such intervention may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways. The nature, pace and volume of this government intervention, and our ability to react in a timely manner to regulatory developments, may adversely impact our ability to compete successfully and, in turn, negatively affect our earnings.        •   We need to constantly invest in innovation, and the inability or failure to do so will negatively affect our businesses and earnings. Our success in this competitive environment requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation. This investment is directed at generating new products and services, and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace. Among other things, investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins. This investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients, and includes investment in technological innovation as well. Effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important. Falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities, growth and earnings.        •   Failure to understand or fully appreciate the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will negatively affect our businesses and earnings. Our success in capitalizing on innovation depends, in part, on successful implementation of new product and service initiatives. Not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings, but we must accurately price them (as well as existing products) on a risk-adjusted basis and effectively deliver them to clients. Our identification of risks arising from new products and services, both in their design and implementation, and effective responses to those identified risks, including pricing, is key to our capitalizing on innovation and investment in new product and service offerings.        •   Our success with large, complex clients requires understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in new jurisdictions. Any failure to understand and deal with those appropriately could affect our growth prospects or negatively affect our reputation.    40    Table of Contents See “Competition” in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Reputation Risks  An important reason that clients bring their business to Northern Trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics, performance, accuracy and compliance.        •   Damage to our reputation can have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete, grow and generate revenue. Damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and so negatively affects our earnings.        •   Maintaining our reputation is important in other key relationships that affect our businesses and our earnings. Damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of clients, rating agencies, regulators, stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business. Failure to maintain our reputation would ultimately have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business.        •   Reputation risk has many facets that could negatively affect our businesses and earnings. Reputational risk is particularly significant in the current environment resulting from the financial crisis. The maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in controlling or mitigating the various risks described above, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in a broad range of areas. These issues include potential conflicts of interest and other ethical issues; anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing procedures; client personal information and privacy issues; effective evaluation of talent and deployment to adequately address complex and rapid growing areas of our businesses; efficiently integrating current staff with their new responsibilities and new staff that are not as familiar with the organization as seamlessly as possible; data security; record-keeping; regulatory investigations of Northern Trust or within the banking industry; and any litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure of Northern Trust to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.  Many of the risks described above are discussed in more detail in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, including the portion captioned “Risk Management” (pages 39-51), and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”, including the portion captioned “Note 24—Contingent Liabilities” (pages 101-102), and throughout “Item 1—Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the portions captioned “Competition,” “Government Monetary and Fiscal Policies” and “Regulation and Supervision” (pages 2-15).  Additionally, the risks described above may cause actual results to differ from the Corporation’s current expectations of future events or future results indicated in what are considered “forward-looking statements” of the Corporation. Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results are also discussed in the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” in the 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 51-53).
