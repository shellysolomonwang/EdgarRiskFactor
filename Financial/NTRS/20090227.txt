Item 1A—Risk Factors  From an investor’s standpoint, public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks. However, each company’s unique combination of strategies, markets served, product and service offerings, processes and systems, and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks. Following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business.  We explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings, as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise. You should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities, such as: reducing our capital, which can have regulatory and     24    Table of Contents  other consequences; affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us, with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses; and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so.  This list is not necessarily complete because we may have failed to appreciate the potential impact on us of risks not described here. We identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls. If we fail to continue to successfully identify and manage significant risks, we could incur financial loss. We may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably, or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive.  Economic, Market, and Monetary Policy Risks  Northern Trust carries on a global business. Changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions both in the U.S. and internationally could adversely affect Northern Trust’s businesses. Factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices, the overall pace of capital markets activities, interest rates, currency exchange rates, investor sentiment and inflation can affect our results.      •    A downturn in economic conditions, such as the current severe global economic downturn, can negatively affect our earnings.        -    Economic weakness can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans, causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit, a higher level of charge-offs, and higher provision for credit losses, all of which reduce our earnings.        -    Economic weakness can also reduce the fees we earn for managing and servicing our customers’ assets. For example, the current downturn in equity markets and the decrease in the value of some debt-related investments as a result of market disruption or illiquidity reduce the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others. This reduces our earnings since a significant part of the fees we earn is based on asset values.        -    Weak economic conditions also affect wealth creation, investment preferences, trading activities, and savings patterns, which impact demand for our trust and investment products and services. Reduced transaction volumes would also negatively impact our earnings.      •    A slowing of the globalization of investment activity or pension reform could limit our revenue growth. We believe we have profited from the increasing globalization of investment activity and from pension reform in many nations that has generated new pools of assets that require management and servicing. Any slowing of this globalization or other such trends would adversely affect factors that have been important in Northern Trust’s recent growth.      •    Instability, disruption or a lack of confidence in the political, economic, legal or regulatory systems of the emerging markets in which we operate could expose us to liability or loss. Northern Trust’s expanding business activities in emerging markets, including investments made for clients in those markets, present the risks inherent in conducting these activities in less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments.      •    Changes in interest rates can negatively affect our earnings. The direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings. Falling rates or rates that remain low can reduce our net interest margin, which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding. Lower net interest margins negatively impact our net interest income and earnings.      •    Fluctuations and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can negatively affect our earnings. We hold various non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities and maintain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We also provide foreign exchange services to our clients, primarily in connection with our global custody business, and effect other transactions in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Foreign currency volatility and fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the value of non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and investments and raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions, where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other, or offset each other in different time periods. If the policies and procedures we have in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange volatility are not followed or are not effective to mitigate such risks, our results and earnings may be negatively affected.    25    Table of Contents   •    Declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can negatively affect our earnings. The value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and adverse economic or financial market conditions. Generally, the fair value of those securities is determined based upon market values available from third party sources. The current period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption has negatively affected the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and asset-backed securities in particular. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities results from declines in securities values that management determines to be other-than-temporary, the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated fair value, we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination, and our earnings may be adversely impacted. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Risk Management – Asset Quality and Credit Risk Management – Securities Portfolio” in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 47—48) and the section of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 4 – Securities” (pages 71—73) for additional information.      •    Changes in a number of particular market conditions can negatively affect our earnings. In past periods, reductions in the volatility of currency trading markets, the level of cross-border investing activity, or the demand for borrowed securities have negatively affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending. If these conditions occur in the future, our earnings from these activities may be negatively affected. In a few of our businesses, such as securities lending, we are compensated through sharing in our client’s earnings, so that market and other factors that reduce our clients’ earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues. The current extraordinary market conditions have produced losses in some securities lending programs, which negatively affect our earnings. This has led some clients to withdraw from these programs, and a persistence or worsening of these conditions could negatively affect earnings and result in additional withdrawals. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements – Variable Interests” in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 42—43) and the section of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 28 – Variable Interest Entities” (pages 95—96) for additional information.      •    Changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the United States, non-U.S. governments and international agencies can reduce our earnings or negatively affect our growth prospects. For example, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States, and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in interest rates and our cost of funds can negatively affect earnings. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board can reduce the value of financial instruments we hold. Its policies also can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available. This can increase the risk that they may fail to repay their loans from us.      •    Failure to develop and implement contingency plans to address market disruptions could adversely affect us. Our success in the area of highly complex asset servicing relationships depends, in part, on our development and successful implementation of contingency plans to address significant market disruptions caused by bankruptcy, insolvency or illiquidity.      •    Governmental action to combat current economic weakness and financial market disruption may not succeed, with various adverse effects on us. The second half of 2008 witnessed unprecedented disruptions in global financial markets, including volatility in asset values and constraints on the availability of credit. In response to these developments, the U.S. and other governments have taken, and may take further, steps designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular. The current upheaval in global financial markets has accentuated each of the risks identified above and magnified their potential effect on Northern Trust. To the extent that these governmental stabilization and mitigation activities are not successful or adversely change the competitive structure of the financial services industry, these developments could have an adverse impact on Northern Trust’s revenues, costs, credit losses, access to capital, or liquidity. They also may impose additional limitations or costs on Northern Trust’s business.  Operational Risks      •    Errors, breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability, result in losses or negatively affect our earnings in other ways. In our asset servicing, investment management, and other business activities, Northern Trust effects or     26    Table of Contents       processes transactions for clients and for itself that involve very large amounts of money. Failure to properly manage or mitigate operational risks can have substantial consequences, and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses.      •    Many types of operational risks can negatively affect our earnings. Many factors can impact operations and expose us to risks that may vary in size, scale and scope, including:        -    Human errors or omissions, including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures;        -    Theft, fraud or misappropriation of assets, whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties;        -    Defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems;        -    Breakdowns in processes, including manual processes, which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes, and over-reliance on manual processes, breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the technology and facilities that support our operations;        -    Unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades;        -    Failures to meet professional or fiduciary obligations to clients;        -    Defects in product design or delivery;        -    Difficulty in accurately pricing assets, which can be aggravated by increased asset coverage, market volatility and illiquidity, and lack of reliable pricing from vendors;        -    Negative developments in relationships with key counterparties, vendors, employees, or associates in our day-to-day operations; and        -    External events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as natural disasters, epidemics, computer viruses, or terrorist events.  In recent years, we have expanded the operational support located in lower-cost areas, where the electricity, communications and other systems necessary to support our activities may not be as strong as in the U.S. This increases the risk that problems with these systems may occur and disrupt our operations in some of the ways just described, resulting in losses.      •    Our dependence on automation exposes us to risks that can also result in losses. Automated systems to record and process transactions, as well as to monitor positions and price assets, can reduce the risk of human error, but our necessary dependence on such systems also increases the risk that system flaws, human tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses. The failure to upgrade systems as necessary to support growth and changing business needs could also have a material adverse effect. Additionally, failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business changes prior to and during introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to adequately align evolving client commitments and expectations with operational capabilities can have a negative impact on our operations.      •    We may fail to detect errors resulting in losses that continue until the problems are detected and fixed. Given the high volume of transactions we process, errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected.      •    Our business continuity plans may not work and thus fail to prevent losses from operational failures. Our business continuity plans address many of these risks, but may not operate successfully to mitigate them. If they do not, we could incur losses, liability to clients or others or reduced earnings.  These risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex, and as our increasingly international business requires end-to-end management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many inter-related products and services.  Investment Performance, Fiduciary and Asset Servicing Risks  Revenues from our investment management, fiduciary, and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings.    27    Table of Contents   •    Failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can negatively affect our earnings and growth prospects. If we do not generate risk-adjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes and are competitive, we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business, which would negatively affect our earnings and prospects.      •    If we fail to comply with legal standards, we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients, which would negatively affect our earnings. Managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction, which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses. Failure to do so can also result in liability, as can failure to manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities or the failure to manage these risks adequately.      •    We may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings. We may find it necessary to take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings, liquidity or valuation issues or other developments, even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments. For example, we have entered into credit support agreements with respect to certain investment funds and we incurred substantial charges to reflect that support in the third quarter of 2008. We incurred other significant charges in that quarter to support securities lending clients and clients who had purchased certain illiquid auction rate securities. The risk that we will need to take such action and incur the resulting losses is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted, as they have been in recent months.  Credit Risks  A number of Northern Trust’s product offerings involve credit risk, which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us. These product offerings include loans, leases and other lending commitments.      •    We may not evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit, or our reserves for credit losses may not be adequate, so that our earnings are reduced by losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses. We evaluate credit commitments before we make them and then allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. This process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments. Challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors. Reserves that prove to be inadequate can directly and negatively affect earnings.      •    Weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions, both of which reduce our earnings. Credit risk levels and our earnings can also be affected by the strength of the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers which could impact the borrowers’ abilities to repay outstanding loans. See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Provision and Reserve for Credit Losses” in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 53 - 55).  Liquidity Risks   Northern Trust depends on access to capital markets to provide sufficient capital resources and other funds to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients.      •    Many events or circumstances could adversely affect our capital costs, our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our ability to meet our commitments. Inadequate capital or the inability to meet our commitments could cause us to incur liability, restrict our ability to grow, or require us to take actions that would negatively affect our earnings. Among the developments that could have this effect are:      - A loss of confidence of debt purchasers, depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets generally or in transactions with Northern Trust;      - Disruption in the market for debt-related securities; and    28    Table of Contents   - A significant downgrade of our debt rating.  See the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 43 - 47).      •    Participation in various U.S. governmental programs may not fully mitigate these risks and may have negative effects. We are participating in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which provides temporary federal guarantees for newly-issued senior unsecured debt and the non-interest bearing transaction accounts of clients. We are also participating in the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”). The Capital Purchase Program requires Treasury approval for any increase in our common stock dividend prior to November 2011 and for us to repurchase shares of our common stock in excess of those needed to offset dilution from our equity compensation programs or other employee benefit plans. In addition to limiting returns to our stockholders, these restrictions could affect our ability to raise additional equity capital.      •    Our success with large, complex clients can put strains on our balance sheet and impose substantial liquidity requirements. Our failure to successfully manage these balance sheet and liquidity issues would have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow.      •    If the Bank or the other subsidiaries of the Corporation were unable to supply the Corporation with funds over time, the Corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations. The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. It relies primarily on dividends paid to it by these subsidiaries to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the Corporation. There are various legal limitations on the extent to which the Bank and the other subsidiaries can supply funds to the Corporation by dividend or otherwise. See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of this report.  Regulation Risks  Virtually every aspect of Northern Trust’s business around the world is regulated, generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions. In the United States, the Corporation, the Bank, and many of the Corporation’s other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. These regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities. They are specifically directed at protecting depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. The Corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by securities regulators, domestically and internationally.      •    Failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business, or that reduce earnings as a result of higher costs. Regulatory violations or failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties, require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business, result in limitations on our ability to conduct business, restrict our ability to expand, or adversely impact our reputation.      •    Changes in laws and regulation could result in reduced earnings. Laws, regulations, and their interpretation by regulatory agencies may change or generate enhanced scrutiny of particular activities. Those changes or enhanced emphasis can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully. The current disruption in financial markets may produce regulatory changes in the U.S. and elsewhere, the effects of which are difficult to predict. In addition, evolving regulations, such as the new Basel II capital regime, and regulations that generate increased scrutiny of particular activities, such as anti-money laundering procedures, require significant time, effort, and resources on our part to ensure compliance in a rapidly changing environment. We often must meet significant milestones in complying with these regulatory requirements. Failure to meet these requirements and milestones could significantly and negatively affect our business. New or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry, including Northern Trust.      •    Compliance with evolving regulations under TARP may impact us in ways that are difficult to predict. Our participation in the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program under TARP subjects us to increased regulatory and legislative oversight. The recently enacted American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) includes amendments to the executive compensation provisions of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”), under which TARP was established. These amendments apply not only to future participants under TARP, but also apply retroactively to companies like us that are current TARP participants. The ARRA amendments also impose restrictions on excessive or luxury expenditures. The full scope and impact of these amendments is uncertain and     29    Table of Contents       difficult to predict. ARRA directs the Secretary of the Treasury to adopt standards that will implement the amended provisions of EESA and directs the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue rules in connection with certain of the amended provisions, but the particular scope of those standards and rules, and the timing of their issuance, is not known. These new legal requirements under TARP and implementing standards may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry as a whole, and particularly on TARP participants such as Northern Trust. They may require significant time, effort, and resources on our part to ensure compliance, and the evolving regulations concerning executive compensation may impose limitations on us that affect our ability to compete successfully for executive and management talent. For additional information concerning our participation in TARP, see “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of this report.      •    Many of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them will restrict our growth. Failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could adversely affect proposed acquisitions, other business opportunities and results of operations.  See “Regulation and Supervision” in Item 1 of this report.  Litigation Risks  Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them. Our trust, custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk. This risk may be heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors, including securities lending clients, are experiencing losses, as they have been in recent months. In addition, as a publicly-held company, we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws, and the recent volatility in the stock prices of Northern Trust and other financial institutions has increased this risk.      •    These claims can result in significant liability or damage to our reputation, which could result in a loss. Even where we defend them successfully, these matters are often expensive to defend. These claims may also cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients, or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties, rating agencies, and stockholders, and so negatively affect our earnings.      •    We may fail to set aside adequate reserves or otherwise make a mistake in evaluating our liability, with a negative effect on our earnings. We estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims, and accrue reserves when appropriate pursuant to applicable accounting rules, by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations. This process is subject to the risk that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts, and to the risk that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case. Earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that our reserves are not adequate.  Tax and Accounting Risks  In the course of its business, Northern Trust is sometimes subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.      •    These challenges can result in reduced earnings in a number of ways. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings.      •    Our provision for structured lease transactions may prove to be inadequate, resulting in additional tax provisions or reduced earnings. In recent years, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service has proposed to disallow tax deductions related to certain types of structured leasing transactions. We made a substantial increase to our provision for taxes in the second quarter of 2008. If this adjustment proves to be inadequate, we would have to make an additional adjustment that would negatively affect earnings.      •    Changes in tax laws and interpretations can negatively affect our earnings. Both U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities from time to time issue new, or modify existing, tax laws and regulations. These authorities may also issue new, or modify existing, interpretations of those laws and regulations. These new laws, regulations or interpretations, and the     30    Table of Contents       Corporation’s actions taken in response to, or reliance upon, such changes in the tax laws may impact the Corporation’s tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings.      •    Changes in accounting rules can negatively affect our earnings and capital ratios. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and other accounting standards-setting organizations make pronouncements and adjustments to their existing accounting guidance that may impact the manner in which the Corporation accounts for certain of its transactions in a way that results in lower earnings or adjustments to the Corporation’s balance sheet resulting in lower capital ratios.  Strategic and Competitive Risks  We have grown through a combination of internal expansion and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities, and we intend to continue to do so. A variety of risks could interfere with these plans.      •    If we do not successfully execute expansion plans, we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be negatively impacted. Failure to integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business, as would the failure to execute successfully a significant internal expansion. The challenges arising from the integration of an acquired business or significant expansion of an existing business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees, clients, suppliers, and other business partners, as well as combining accounting, data processing and internal control systems.      •    Failure to execute our other strategies could also negatively affect our prospects. Our growth also depends upon successful, consistent execution of our business strategies in both PFS and C&IS. Recruiting and maintaining skilled personnel, and deploying such key talent in a manner that allows execution of these strategies is important, particularly in highly complex and rapidly growing areas of our business. A failure to do so, or to otherwise successfully carry out our plans, could negatively impact growth.      •    We face a variety of competitive challenges that could negatively affect our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings. We provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets, in which pricing can be a key competitive factor. Merger activity in the financial services industry, including mergers resulting from government intervention and the overall disruption in the financial services industry, continues to produce large, in some cases well-capitalized, and geographically-diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices. In certain businesses, such as foreign exchange trading, electronic networks present a competitive challenge. Additionally, technological advances and the growth of internet-based commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business. Many of these non-traditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures. These competitive pressures can negatively affect earnings and our ability to grow.      •    Intervention of the U.S. and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the competitive challenges we face. In response to the continuing disruptions in global financial markets currently being experienced, the government of the United States and other governments around the world have taken, and may take further, unprecedented actions designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular. These actions may involve increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry. Such intervention may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways. The nature, pace and volume of this government intervention, and our ability to react in a timely manner to regulatory developments, may adversely impact our ability to compete successfully and, in turn, negatively affect our earnings.      •    We need to constantly invest in innovation, and any inability or failure to do so will negatively affect our businesses and earnings. Our success in this competitive environment requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation. This investment is directed at generating new products and services, and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace. Among other things, this helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins. This investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients, and includes investment in technological innovation as well. Effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings, particularly in the area of securities lending, also is important. Falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities, our growth and our earnings.    31    Table of Contents   •    Failure to understand or fully appreciate the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will negatively affect our businesses and earnings. Our success in capitalizing on innovation depends, in part, on successful implementation of new product and service initiatives. Not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings, but we must accurately price them (as well as existing products) on a risk-adjusted basis and effectively deliver them to clients. Our identification of risks arising from new products and services, both in their design and implementation, and effective responses to those identified risks, including pricing, is key to our capitalizing on innovation and investment in new product and service offerings.      •    Failure to adequately control our costs could negatively affect our ability to compete and thus reduce our earnings. Our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results. Another goal of innovation, as a part of our business strategy, is to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses, including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets.      •    Our success with large, complex clients requires understanding of the market and legal, regulatory and accounting standards in new jurisdictions. Any failure to understand and deal with those appropriately could affect our growth prospects or negatively affect our reputation.  Reputation Risks  An important reason that clients bring their business to Northern Trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics, performance, accuracy and compliance.      •    Damage to our reputation has a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete, grow and generate revenue. Damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and so negatively affects our earnings.      •    Maintaining our reputation is important in other key relationships that affect our businesses and our earnings. Damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business, rating agencies, and stockholders in Northern Trust. Failure to maintain our reputation would ultimately have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or effect transactions.      •    Reputation risk has many facets that could negatively affect our businesses and earnings. The maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in controlling or mitigating the various risks described above, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in a broad range of areas. These include potential conflicts of interest and other ethical issues; anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing procedures; customer personal information and privacy issues; effective evaluation of talent and deployment to adequately address complex and rapid growing areas of our businesses, data security; record-keeping; regulatory investigations of Northern Trust or within the banking industry; and any litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure of Northern Trust to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.  Many of the risks described above are discussed in more detail in the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Risk Management” in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 47 - 48), in the section of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders captioned “Note 25 – Contingent Liabilities” (pages 91 - 92), and in the sections of “Item 1 – Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K captioned “Government Monetary and Fiscal Policies,” “Competition” and “Regulation and Supervision” (pages 2 - 11).  Additionally, the risks described above may cause actual results to differ from the Corporation’s current expectations of future events or future results indicated in what are considered “forward-looking statements” of the Corporation. Forward-looking statements and factors that may affect future results are also discussed in the section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” captioned “Factors Affecting Future Results” in the 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders (pages 58 - 59).
