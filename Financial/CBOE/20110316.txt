Item 1A. Risk Factors    Certain statements contained in this report under various sections, including "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Statements." These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Risks Relating to Our Business   Regulatory changes affecting the listed options market could have a material adverse effect on our business.   The listed options market depends on a national market structure that facilitates the efficient buying and selling of underlying stocks, futures and other products. Changes in regulation by the SEC or other government action could materially affect our markets. For example, the SEC is considering new rules related to short selling, in addition to the restrictions implemented in May 2010, that could impact the use of options by both members and customers. In particular, the current restrictions on short selling do not contain an options market maker exception and could adversely affect the ability of options market-makers to conduct their business on our exchanges. In addition, the SEC has proposed a rule that would ban the use of "flash orders." We believe that prohibiting flash orders would eliminate price improvement opportunities and create additional execution costs for our customers. We cannot predict what future actions the SEC might take with respect to its rulemakings on short selling, flash orders or other matters, or the impact that any such actions may have on our business. If our market participants reduce or otherwise modify their trading activity on our exchanges due to proposed or actual regulatory changes, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially impacted. See also "—Legislative or Regulatory changes, particularly in response to adverse financial conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business."  30                Table of Contents   The SEC also published for comment in 2010 proposed rule amendments that, if adopted as proposed, would place a $0.30 per contract limit on the total access fees that an exchange may charge for the execution of an order against a quotation that is the best bid or best offer of such exchange in a listed option. We cannot predict whether the SEC will adopt the fee cap as proposed, a modified version or at all. The potential impact to our revenues, however, would depend on changes in our contract volume and product mix in future periods as well as other factors, including those that are currently being considered as part of the rulemaking process. For example, in its release, the SEC asks whether the proposed fee cap should only apply to multiply-listed options. If the proposed rules are adopted as proposed, or are adopted in a form substantially similar to that proposed, and we are unable to change our fee structure in response to the rules as adopted, they would have a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations and financial condition. See also "Business—Regulatory Environment and Compliance—Recent Developments—Fee Caps."   Loss of our exclusive licenses to list certain index options could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.   We hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 100 Index and the DJIA, granted to us by the owners of such indexes. In 2010, approximately 35% of our transaction fees was generated by our exclusively-licensed index products, up from 32% in 2009. Revenue attributable to SPX, our S&P 500 Index option product and our largest product by revenue, represented 98% of the transaction fees generated by our exclusively-licensed index products, up from 92% in 2009. As a result, our operating revenues are dependent in part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products.   The value of our exclusive licenses to list securities index options depends on the continued ability of index owners to grant us licenses or require licenses for the trading of options based on their indexes. Although recent court decisions have allowed the trading of options on ETFs based on indexes without licenses from the owners of the underlying indexes, none of these decisions has overturned existing legal precedent that requires an exchange to be licensed by the owner of an underlying index before it may list options based on the index. However, in two pending cases International Securities Exchange, Inc., or ISE, is seeking a judicial determination that it (and, by extension, other options exchanges) has the right to list options on the S&P 500 Index and the DJIA without licenses and, therefore, without regard to our exclusive licenses to list securities options on those indexes.   Because these cases are still pending, there remains a risk that ISE may be successful in obtaining a judicial determination eliminating the right of index owners to require licenses to use their indexes for options trading, including on an exclusive basis. In addition, competing exchanges may convince the SEC, or seek a judicial action, to limit the right of index owners to grant exclusive licenses for index options trading or to prevent exchanges from entering into such exclusive licenses. If unlicensed trading of index options were permitted or if exclusive licenses for index options trading were prohibited or limited, the value of our exclusive licenses would be eliminated, and we likely would lose market share in these index options. An adverse ruling in the ISE litigation could also result in legal challenges to our exclusive use of our proprietary indexes for options.   There is also a risk, with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses, that the owner of the index may not to renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all. In the first event, we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an exclusive index product, resulting in a loss of market share and negatively impacting the profitability of the licensed products. In the second event, we could lose the right to list the index product entirely. The loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. See "Business—Products—Strategic Relationships" for a discussion of these licenses and their expiration dates.  31      Table of Contents  Furthermore, our competitors may succeed in providing a market for the trading of index-based products that are economically similar to those for which we have exclusive licenses. It is also possible that a third party may offer trading in index-based products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses, but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not covered by our exclusive license.   Recently, we agreed with S&P that it may license one or more clearing agencies to clear OTC options based on the S&P 500 index that meet certain criteria, some of which are currently under negotiation, and that S&P will compensate us for any transaction cleared under such a license based on the notional value of the transaction. Although we expect these transactions to generate incremental revenue, the clearing of options on the S&P 500 index that are traded OTC could lead to the migration to the OTC market of some trades that today would be entered into on our exchanges, and there can be no assurance that any revenue gained will replace the revenue lost due to any migration.   A significant portion of our operating revenues are generated by our transaction-based business. If the amount of trading volume on our exchanges decreases, our revenues from transaction fees will decrease.   In 2010, 2009 and 2008, approximately 76%, 74% and 83% of our operating revenues, respectively, were generated by our transaction-based business. This business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow, both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers. Our total trading volumes could decline if our market participants decide to reduce their level of trading activity for any reason, such as:    •a reduction in the number of traders that use us,   •a reduction in trading demand by customers,   •heightened capital maintenance requirements or other regulatory or legislative requirements,   •reduced access to capital required to fund trading activities or   •significant market disruptions.    If the amount of our trading volume decreases, our revenues from transaction fees will decrease. There may also be a reduction in revenue from market data fees or other sources of revenue. If our share of total trading volumes decreases relative to our competitors, our markets may be less attractive to market participants, and we may lose trading volume and associated transaction fees and market data fees as a result.   Intense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance.   Competition among options exchanges has intensified since CBOE was created in 1973, and we expect this trend to continue. We compete with a number of entities on several different fronts, including the cost, quality and speed of our trade execution, the functionality and ease of use of our trading platform, the range of our products and services, our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation. Our principal competitors are the seven other U.S. options exchanges. We also compete against investment banks and others trading options over-the-counter.   We currently face greater competition than ever before in our history. Virtually all of the equity options and options on ETFs listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on other U.S. options exchanges. Some order-providing firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us, thereby giving those firms an added incentive to direct orders to the exchanges they own. As a result of these competitive developments, our market share of options traded in the U.S. fell from approximately 45% in 2000 to approximately 29% in 2010.  32      Table of Contents  In response to these developments, we developed our own electronic trading facility that we operate as part of a "hybrid" model, combining electronic trading and remote off-floor market-makers with traditional floor-based, open outcry trading. We also administer a program through which we collect a marketing fee on market maker transactions. The funds collected are made available to the specialist and preferred market-makers for use in payment for order flow. Finally, in October 2010, we launched C2, our all-electronic exchange. These changes may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share in the future. Likewise, our future responses to these or other competitive developments may not be successful in maintaining or expanding our market share.   In addition, many of our competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial, marketing, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products, to offer lower transaction fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can.   Furthermore, our competitors may:    •respond more quickly to competitive pressures;   •develop products that compete with our products or are preferred by our customers;   •price their products and services more competitively;   •develop and expand their technology and service offerings more efficiently;   •provide better, more user-friendly and more reliable technology;   •take greater advantage of acquisitions, alliances and other opportunities;   •market, promote and sell their products and services more effectively;   •leverage existing relationships with customers and alliance partners more effectively or exploit brand names to market and sell their services; and   •exploit regulatory disparities between traditional, regulated exchanges and alternative markets, including over-the-counter markets, that benefit from a reduced regulatory burden and lower-cost business model.    In recent years, the derivatives industry has witnessed increased consolidation among market participants, including option exchanges and marketplaces. Consolidation and alliances among our competitors may create greater liquidity than we offer. As a result, the larger liquidity pools may attract orders away from us, leading to reductions in trading volume and liquidity and, therefore, to decreased revenues. In addition, consolidation or alliances among our competitors may achieve cost reductions or other increases in efficiency, which may allow them to offer better prices or services than we do.   If our products, markets, services and technology are not competitive, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed. A decline in our transaction fees or any loss of customers would lower our revenues, which would adversely affect our profitability. For a discussion of the competitive environment in which we operate, see "Business—Competition."   Our business may be adversely affected by price competition.   The business of operating options exchanges is characterized by intense price competition. The pricing model for trade execution for options has changed in response to competitive market conditions and we and our competitors have adjusted our transaction fees and fee structures accordingly. Some competitors have introduced a market model in which orders that take liquidity from the market are charged a transaction fee and orders that provide liquidity receive a rebate. These changes have resulted in significant pricing and cost pressures on us. It is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing  33      Table of Contents  their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets. In addition, one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading. If any of these or other events occur, our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected. For example, we could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner. Also, our profit margins could decline if competitive pressures force us to reduce fees.   We may not be able to generate a significant amount of incremental operating revenues by making trading access available in exchange for a fee.   Prior to our restructuring, the ability to trade on CBOE was an inherent right of every CBOE membership, and owners of CBOE Seats either used the CBOE Seat to trade or leased the CBOE Seat to an individual or firm who used it to trade. As a result of the restructuring transaction, trading access was separated from ownership. The right to trade on CBOE was made available through trading permits for which the user paid a fee. These fees, effective July 1, 2010, accounted for, and in the future are expected to account for, a significant portion of our operating revenues. If the demand for access to CBOE is less than historic levels or if we are unable to maintain permit rates, our ability to generate incremental operating revenues through the granting of permits for trading access would be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our profitability.   Market fluctuations and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business.   The volume of options transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic, political and market conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control, including:    •broad trends in business and finance;   •concerns about terrorism and war;   •concerns over inflation and wavering institutional or retail confidence levels;   •changes in government monetary policy and foreign currency exchange rates;   •the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital;   •the availability of alternative investment opportunities;   •changes in the level of trading activity in underlying instruments;   •changes and volatility in the prices of securities;   •the level and volatility of interest rates; and   •unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading.    General economic conditions affect options trading in a variety of ways, from the availability of capital to investor confidence. The economic climate in recent years has been characterized by challenging business, economic and political conditions throughout the world. Adverse changes in the economy can have a negative impact on our revenues by causing a decline in trading volume. Because our management structure and overhead costs will be based on assumptions of certain levels of market activity, significant declines in trading volumes or demand for market data may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  34                Table of Contents   Damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.   One of our competitive strengths is our strong reputation and brand name. This reputation could be harmed in many different ways, including by regulatory failures, governance failures or technology failures. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to attract customers, liquidity providers and order flow, which in turn could impair the competitiveness of our markets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.   We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.   We rely on patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual protections to protect our proprietary technology, proprietary index products, index methodologies and other proprietary rights. In addition, we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusively-licensed index products. We and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying, or otherwise obtaining and using, our intellectual property without authorization, listing our proprietary or exclusively-licensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights. We and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. We and our licensors may not be successful in this regard. Such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us, diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. For a description of current litigation involving, among other things, these matters, please see "Legal Proceedings."   Computer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business.   We must operate, monitor and maintain our computer systems and network services, including those related to our electronic trading systems, in a secure and reliable manner. A failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the functionality and reliability of our market, our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. System failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulators, file lawsuits against us or cease doing business with us. It could also lead regulators to initiate inquiries or proceedings for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Any of these effects could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.   The computer systems and communication networks upon which we rely in our operations may be vulnerable to security risks and other disruptions.   The secure and reliable operation of our computer systems and communications networks, and those of our service providers and market participants, is a critical element of our operations. These systems and communications networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other security problems, as well as to acts of terrorism, natural disasters and other force majeure events. If our security measures are compromised or if there are interruptions or malfunctions in our systems or communications networks, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially impacted. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including harm to reputation and litigation, caused by any breaches in security or system failures. Although we intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures and otherwise to provide for the integrity and reliability of our systems, these measures may prove to be inadequate in preventing system failures or delays in our systems or communications networks, which could lower trading volume and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  35      Table of Contents   We may be unable to keep up with rapid technological changes.   Our industry has experienced, and will continue to experience, rapid technological change, changes in use and customer requirements and preferences, frequent product and service introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and features of our automated trading and communications systems. This will require us to continue to attract and retain a highly-skilled technology staff and invest the financial resources necessary to keep our systems up to date. If we fail to do so, our systems could become less competitive, which could result in the loss of customers and trading volume and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.   Our decision to operate a second marketplace may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   In October 2010, we launched a second exchange, C2. C2 operates separately from CBOE with its own governance structure and systems. C2 operates as an electronic marketplace and is capable of trading all of CBOE's products. We have spent substantial funds and incurred significant capital expenditures on the development of C2. C2 may be unable to generate sufficient transaction volume and cash flow to provide a satisfactory return on our investment. It also is possible that member firms may choose not to connect to C2, for instance, because they may conclude that doing so will not attract sufficient order flow to justify the connection cost. A failure of C2 as an exchange could result in a write off of all or some portion of our investment in C2's development and could negatively affect our reputation.   A significant portion of our cost structure is fixed. If our operating revenues decline and we are unable to reduce our costs, our profitability will be adversely affected.   A significant portion of our cost structure is fixed, meaning that such portion of our cost structure is generally independent of trading volume. Salaries and benefits, which represented 24.3% of our total operating expenses in 2010, are our largest expense category and tend to be driven by both our staffing requirements and the general dynamics of the employment market, rather than trading volumes. If demand for our products and services declines, our operating revenues will decline. We may not be able to adjust our cost structure, at all or on a timely basis, to counteract a decrease in revenue, which would result in an adverse impact on our profitability. Moreover, if demand for future products that we acquire or license is not at the level necessary to offset the cost of the acquisition or license, our net income would decline.   Our market data revenues may be reduced or eliminated due to a decline in our market share, regulatory action or a reduction in the number of market data users.   We obtain approximately 3.6% of our operating revenues from our share of the revenues collected by the Options Price Reporting Authority, or OPRA, for the dissemination of options market data. If our share of options trading were to decline, our share of OPRA market data revenue would also decline. Market data revenue could also decline as a result of a reduction in the numbers of market data users, for example, because of consolidation among market data subscribers, due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise. Finally, the SEC could take regulatory action to revise the formula for allocating options market data revenues among the options exchanges as it has in the past, or it could take other regulatory action that could have the effect of reducing total options market data revenue or our share of that revenue. Any significant decline in the revenue we realize from the dissemination of market data could have an adverse effect on our profitability.  36      Table of Contents   If we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees, our business may be harmed.   Our future success depends in large part on our management team, which possesses extensive knowledge and managerial skill with respect to the critical aspects of our business. The failure to retain certain members of our management team could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively and execute our business strategy.   Our business is also dependent on highly skilled employees who provide specialized services to our clients and oversee our compliance and technology functions. Many of these employees have extensive knowledge and experience in highly technical and complex areas of the options trading industry. Because of the complexity and risks associated with our business and the specialized knowledge required to conduct this business effectively, and because the growth in our industry has increased demand for qualified personnel, many of our employees could find employment at other firms if they chose to do so, particularly if we fail to continue to provide competitive levels of compensation. If we fail to retain our current employees, it would be difficult and costly to identify, recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business. In particular, failure to retain and attract qualified systems and compliance personnel could result in systems errors or regulatory infractions. Consequently, our reputation may be harmed, we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline.   We may not effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business.   We expect that our business will continue to grow, which may place a significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. We must continue to improve our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures, and we will need to continue to expand, train and manage our technology workforce. We must also maintain close coordination among our technology, compliance, accounting, finance, marketing and sales functions. We cannot assure you that we will manage our growth effectively. If we fail to do so, our business could be materially harmed.   Our continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology, facilities, personnel and financial and management systems and controls. It also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations, and we will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. The expansion of our existing businesses, any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes, which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required. We may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary. Further, unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected.   We depend on third party service providers for certain services that are important to our business. An interruption or cessation of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business.   We depend on a number of service providers, including banking and clearing organizations such as the OCC and its member clearing firms; processors of market information such as the Consolidated Tape Association and OPRA; and various vendors of communications and networking products and services. We cannot assure you that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. An interruption or malfunction in or the cessation of an important service by any third party and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.  37      Table of Contents   If our risk management methods are not effective, our business, reputation and financial results may be adversely affected.   We have methods to identify, monitor and manage our risks; however, these methods may not be fully effective. Some of our risk management methods may depend upon evaluation of information regarding markets, customers or other matters. That information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. If our methods are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed, our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.   Current economic conditions could make it difficult for us to finance our future operations.   Companies in many different industries have found it difficult to borrow money from banks and other lending sources, and have also experienced difficulty raising funds in the capital markets. Continued instability in the financial markets, as a result of recession or otherwise, may affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise capital. Although we have no current need for additional financing, if we need to raise funds in the future, our ability to do so could be impaired if rating agencies, lenders or investors develop a negative perception of our financial prospects or the prospects for our industry. If difficult market conditions continue or if a negative perception of our financial prospects were to develop, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all.   We may selectively explore acquisition opportunities or strategic alliances relating to other businesses, products or technologies. We may not be successful in identifying opportunities or integrating other businesses, products or technologies with our business. Any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate, which could adversely affect the market price of our unrestricted common stock.   We may selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. We may enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances, any of which may be material. We may enter into these transactions to acquire other businesses, products or technologies, expand our products and services, advance our technology or take advantage of new developments and potential changes in the industry.   The market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is highly competitive, particularly in light of ongoing consolidation in the exchange sector. As a result, we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities or we may be unable to negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully. Further, our competitors could merge, making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors. If we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment, financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us.   The process of integration may produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business. Further, as a result of any future acquisition or strategic transaction, we may issue additional shares of our stock that dilute stockholders' ownership interest in us, expend cash, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets with estimable useful lives. In addition, difficulties in integrating the businesses or any negative impact on the regulatory functions of any of our companies could harm the reputation of the companies. We may not successfully achieve the integration objectives, and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings, revenue growth and synergies in full or at all, or it may take longer to realize them than expected, any  38      Table of Contents  of which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or the market price of our common stock.   Risks Relating to Litigation and Regulation   Any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.   Our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, or may obtain, patents that are related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products, services or technologies. In addition, some patent applications in the United States are confidential until a patent is issued, and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications. Thus, we cannot be sure that our products and services do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us. Claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry. If one or more of our products, services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent held by another party, we may be required to stop developing or marketing those products, services or technologies, obtain a license to develop and market those services from the holders of the patents or redesign those products, services or technologies to avoid infringing the patent. If we were required to stop developing or marketing certain products, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed. Moreover, if we were unable to obtain required licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For a discussion of patent litigation involving us, please see "Legal Proceedings."   We operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.   CBOE and C2 are registered national securities exchange and self-regulatory organizations, or SROs, and, as such, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the SEC. Our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The SEC has broad powers to audit, investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by SROs pursuant to the Exchange Act and the SEC's rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. If the SEC were to find CBOE or C2's program of enforcement and compliance to be deficient, CBOE or C2 could be the subject of SEC investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions, including revocation of its registration as a national securities exchange. Any such investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, although CBOE and C2 intend to retain their responsibilities as SROs, they may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment, or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions, each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate.   CFE is a designated contract market registered with the CFTC. Because CFE is subject to comprehensive regulation by the CFTC, CFE is subject to substantially similar risks with respect to its regulatory and legal obligations as CBOE and C2 in relation to their regulation by the SEC.   Although CBOE Holdings itself is not an SRO, CBOE Holdings is subject to regulation by the SEC of activities that involve the exchanges. Specifically, the SEC will exercise oversight over the  39      Table of Contents  governance of CBOE Holdings and its relationship with the CBOE and C2. See "Regulatory Environment and Compliance—Regulatory Responsibilities."   Legislative or regulatory changes, particularly in response to adverse financial conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business.   In recent years, the securities trading industry and, in particular, the securities markets have been subject to significant regulatory changes. Moreover, in the past three years, the securities markets have been the subject of increasing government and public scrutiny in response to the global economic crisis.   In response to the economic crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislation. It is possible that there will be additional legislative changes and changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate our businesses, although we cannot predict the nature of these changes or their impact on our business at this time. For example, the SEC published a concept release early in 2010 related to trading in equity markets that could result in changes in the competitive landscape in the options market. Actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the U.S., such as fee caps, co-location, high-frequency trading, derivatives clearing, market transparency, taxes on stock transactions, restrictions on proprietary trading by certain of our customers and other related proposals could have a material impact on our business. For a discussion of the regulatory environment in which we operate and proposed regulatory changes, see "Businesss—Regulatory Environment and Compliance."   We and our market participants also operate in a highly regulated industry. Congress, the SEC and other regulatory authorities could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets. Legislative and regulatory changes by Congress, the SEC or other regulatory authorities could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.   Potential conflicts of interest between our for-profit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business.   As a for-profit business with regulatory responsibilities, there may be a conflict of interest between our regulatory responsibilities and the interests of some of our market participants. Any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, increase regulatory scrutiny and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.   Our compliance methods might not be effective and may result in outcomes that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.   Our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel. Our policies and procedures to identify, monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective. Management of legal and regulatory risk requires policies and procedures to properly monitor, record and verify a large number of transactions and events. We cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the compliance risks to which we are or may be exposed.   Our ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation, which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes.   Our subsidiaries registered with the SEC must submit proposed rule changes to the SEC for its review and, in many cases, its approval. Even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the SEC, the SEC retains the right to abrogate such rule changes. The SEC review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets. If the SEC refuses to approve a proposed rule change or delays its approval, this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business decisions.  40                 Table of Contents   Similarly, the SEC must approve amendments to our subsidiaries' certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of CBOE Holdings. The SEC may not approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change, which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products.   Misconduct by our customers or others could harm us.   Although we perform significant self-regulatory functions, we run the risk that our Trading Permit Holders, other persons who use our markets or our employees will engage in fraud or other misconduct, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases.   Changes in the tax structure affecting us and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business.   There are currently proposals in both the Illinois and federal legislatures that, if implemented, would change the existing structure for options and futures market participants. In Illinois, the proposal would create a financial transaction tax, which would impose a tax of 0.01% on the value of any transaction on our exchange. If such a tax were implemented, it could cause us competitive harm, since exchanges outside of Illinois would not be subject to the tax, and would increase the cost of trading options on our exchange, which could reduce trading in options.   At the federal level, there is a proposal that calls for repeal of the "60/40 Rule," which allows market-makers to pay a blend of capital gains and ordinary tax rates on their income. In addition, federal legislation has been introduced that would impose a new tax on securities, futures and swap transactions, including exchange-traded options. If either the proposed repeal of the "60/40 Rule" or a transaction tax were to become law, the resulting additional taxes could have a negative impact on the options industry and us by making options transactions more costly to market participants.   Risks Relating to Our Common Stock   Your percentage ownership may be diluted if additional capital stock is issued.   We may seek to raise capital to finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, to issue our authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock. Future issuances of common or preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote and would be dilutive to earnings per share. In addition, any newly issued preferred stock could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Those rights, preferences and privileges could include, among other things, the establishment of dividends that must be paid prior to declaring or paying dividends or other distributions to holders of our common stock, greater or preferential liquidation rights, which could negatively affect the rights of holders of our common stock, and the right to convert such preferred stock into shares of our common stock at a rate or price that would have a dilutive effect on the outstanding shares of our common stock.   The sale of large amounts of our common stock following the automatic conversion of our Class A-2 common stock into shares of unrestricted common stock may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.   Our shares of Class A-2 common stock are subject to significant transfer restrictions that expire on June 13, 2011. Upon expiration of these restrictions, the shares of Class A-2 common stock held by  41      Table of Contents  existing stockholders will automatically convert into shares of unrestricted common stock, and will be freely transferable unless the shares are held by "affiliates" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If our stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock upon the expiration of the transfer restrictions, the market price for our common stock could decline significantly.   Our Trading Permit Holders own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, which could be used to influence how our business is operated to the detriment of other holders of our common stock.   Immediately following our demutualization and initial public offering, approximately 73% of our common stock was issued to former CBOE Seat holders, a significant number of which are Trading Permit Holders. All of our outstanding Class A-2 common stock is currently held by former CBOE Seat holders. Our stockholders who are also Trading Permit Holders may have interests that differ from or conflict with those of stockholders who are not Trading Permit Holders. Stockholders who are Trading Permit Holders own a substantial portion of our voting stock. As a result, they could exert substantial influence over the operation of our business.   Many of our Trading Permit Holders derive a substantial portion of their income from their trading on or through our exchanges. The amount of income that they derive from their trading activities is in part dependent on the fees they are charged to trade and access our markets and the rules and structure of our markets. Our Trading Permit Holders, many of whom act as floor brokers and floor traders, benefit from trading rules, access privileges and fee discounts that enhance their trading opportunities and profits. As a result, other holders of our common stock may not have the same economic interests as our Trading Permit Holders. Consequently, Trading Permit Holders may advocate that we enhance and protect their trading opportunities and the value they receive through their trading permits over their economic interest in us represented by the common stock that they own. The share ownership of our Trading Permit Holders could be used to influence how our business is changed or developed, including how we address competition and how we seek to grow our volume and revenue and enhance stockholder value.   Any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders.   We have paid quarterly dividends since the restructuring transaction and initial public offering and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders. However, any decision to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of the board of directors, which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount. The board's determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and the SEC and other factors that the board deems relevant. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, CBOE Holdings will depend entirely on distributions, if any, it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders. If these subsidiaries are not profitable, or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses, we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders.   Certain provisions in our organizational documents could enable the board of directors to prevent or delay a change of control.   Our organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of, or unsolicited acquisition proposals for, us that a stockholder might consider favorable. These include provisions:    •prohibiting the stockholders from acting by written consent;   42      Table of Contents   •requiring advance notice of director nominations and of business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders;   •requiring the vote of majority of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws; and   •limiting the persons who may call special stockholders' meetings.   In addition, our organizational documents include provisions that:    •restrict any person from voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 20% of our outstanding voting capital stock; and   •restrict any person from beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock.    Furthermore, our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval. Any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends, liquidation rights and, possibly, voting rights. The ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.   In addition, Delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors' wishes. Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a Delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances, including by approval of the corporation's board of directors.
