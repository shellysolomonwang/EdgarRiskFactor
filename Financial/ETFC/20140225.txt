ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  The following discussion sets forth the risk factors which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and should be carefully considered in addition to the other information set forth in this report. These are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not deem to be material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Risks Relating to the Nature and Operation of Our Business  We have incurred significant losses in recent years and cannot assure that we will be profitable in the future.  We incurred a net loss of $112.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, due primarily to a $256.9 million loss on the early extinguishment of all the 12 1/2% springing lien notes due November 2017 (“12 1/2% Springing lien notes”) and 7 7/8% senior notes due December 2015 (“7 7/8% Notes”). Although we have taken a significant number of steps to reduce our credit exposure and reported net income of $86.0 million and $156.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2011, respectively, we likely will continue to suffer credit losses in 2014. In late 2007, we experienced a substantial diminution of customer assets and accounts as a result of customer concerns regarding our credit related exposures. While we were able to stabilize our retail franchise during the ensuing period, it could take additional time to fully mitigate the credit issues in our loan portfolio, which could result in a net loss position.  We will continue to experience losses in our mortgage loan portfolio.  At December 31, 2013, the principal balance of our home equity loan portfolio was $3.5 billion and the allowance for loan losses for this portfolio was $326.1 million. At December 31, 2013, the principal balance of our one- to four-family loan portfolio was $4.5 billion and the allowance for loan losses for this portfolio was $102.2 million. Although the provision for loan losses has declined in recent periods, performance is subject to variability in any given quarter and we cannot state with certainty that the declining loan loss trend will continue. Due to the complexity and judgment required by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, there can be no assurance that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate. In the normal course of conducting examinations, our banking regulators, the OCC and Federal Reserve, continue to review our policies and procedures. This process is dynamic and ongoing and we cannot be certain that additional changes or actions to our policies and procedures will not result from their continuing review. We may be required under such circumstances to further increase the allowance for loan losses, which could have an adverse effect on our regulatory capital position and our results of operations in future periods.  The carrying value of the home equity and one- to four-family loan portfolios was $3.1 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2013. The home equity and one- to four-family loan portfolios are held on the consolidated balance sheet at carrying value because they are classified as held for investment, which indicates that we have the intent and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity. The fair value of our home equity and one- to four-family loan portfolios was estimated to be $2.8 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2013, in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting guidance, as disclosed in Note 4—Fair Value Disclosures of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The fair value of the home equity and one- to four-family loan portfolios was estimated using a modeling technique that discounted future cash flows based on estimated principal and interest payments over the life of the loans, including expected losses and prepayments. There was limited or no observable market data for the home equity and one- to four-family loan portfolios. Given the limited market data, the fair value measurements cannot be determined with precision and the amount that would be realized in a forced liquidation, an actual sale or immediate settlement could be significantly lower than both the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the portfolio. In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the results of current or future fair value estimates.    10    Table of Contents Certain characteristics of our mortgage loan portfolio indicate an increased risk of loss. For example, at December 31, 2013:        •    approximately 27% and 42% of the one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios, respectively, had a current loan-to-value (“LTV”)/combined loan-to-value (“CLTV”) of greater than 100%;        •    approximately 59% and 49% of the one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios, respectively, were originated with low or no documentation; and        •    borrowers with current Fair Isaac Credit Organization (“FICO”) scores less than 700 consisted of approximately 40% and 38% of the one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolios, respectively.  The foregoing factors are among the key items we track to predict and monitor credit risk in our mortgage portfolio, together with loan type, housing prices, loan vintage and geographic location of the underlying property. We believe the relative importance of these factors varies, depending upon economic conditions.  Home equity loans have certain characteristics that result in higher risk than first lien, amortizing one- to four-family loans.  Approximately 85% of the home equity loan portfolio consists of second lien loans on residential real estate properties. The average estimated current CLTV on our home equity loan portfolio was 98% as of December 31, 2013. We hold both the first and second lien positions in less than 1% of the home equity loan portfolio, exposing us to risk associated with the actions and inactions of the first lien lender.  We monitor our borrowers by refreshing FICO scores and CLTV information on a quarterly basis. We do not have access to complete data on the first lien positions of second lien home equity loans. In addition, we rely on third party servicers to provide payment information on home equity loans, including which borrowers are paying only the minimum amount due.  Home equity lines of credit convert to amortizing loans at the end of the draw period, which typically ranges from five to ten years. Approximately 9% of this portfolio will require borrowers to repay the loan in full at the end of the draw period, commonly referred to as “balloon loans”. At December 31, 2013, the majority of the home equity line of credit portfolio had not converted from the interest-only draw period to an amortizing loan. In addition, approximately 80% of the home equity line of credit portfolio will not begin amortizing until after 2014. As a result, we do not yet have sufficient data relating to loan default and delinquency of amortizing home equity lines of credit to determine if the performance is different than the trends observed for home equity lines of credit in an interest-only draw period.  We rely on third party service providers to perform certain key functions.  We rely on third party service providers for certain technology, processing, servicing and support functions. These third party service providers are also subject to operational and technology vulnerabilities, which may impact our business. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any third party service provider and our inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could have a material impact on our business and financial performance.  We do not directly service any of our loans and as a result, we rely on third party vendors and servicers to provide information on our loan portfolio. From time to time we have discovered that these vendors and servicers have provided incomplete or untimely information to us about our loan portfolio. For example, provision for loan losses increased in the third quarter of 2012 in connection with our discovery that one of our third party loan servicers had not been reporting historical bankruptcy data to us on a timely basis and, as a result, we recorded additional charge-offs in the third quarter of 2012. In connection with this discovery, we implemented an enhanced procedure around all servicer reporting to corroborate bankruptcy reporting with independent third party data.    11    Table of Contents Loss of customers and assets could destabilize the Company or result in lower revenues in future periods.  During November 2007, well-publicized concerns about E*TRADE Bank’s holdings of asset-backed securities led to widespread concerns about our continued viability. From the beginning of this crisis through December 31, 2007, when the situation stabilized, customers withdrew approximately $5.6 billion of net cash and approximately $12.2 billion of net assets from our bank and brokerage businesses. Many of the accounts that were closed belonged to sophisticated and active customers with large cash and securities balances. While we were able to stabilize our retail franchise, concerns about our viability may recur, which could lead to destabilization and asset and customer attrition. If such destabilization should occur, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully rebuild our franchise by reclaiming customers and growing assets. If we are unable to sustain or, if necessary, rebuild our franchise, in future periods our revenues could be lower and our losses could be greater than we have experienced in the past.  We have a large amount of corporate debt which limits how we conduct our business.  We have issued a substantial amount of corporate debt, with restrictive financial and other covenants and our expected annual interest cash outlay is approximately $110 million. Our ratio of corporate debt to equity (expressed as a percentage) was 36% at December 31, 2013. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including:        •    a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;        •    our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate needs is significantly limited; and        •    our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage, hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and make us more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in general economic conditions or our business.  In addition, a significant reduction in revenues could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our debt obligations.  We conduct all of our operations through subsidiaries and rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for all of our revenues, which are subject to advance regulatory approval in the case of our most significant subsidiaries.  We depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including our debt obligations. Regulatory and other legal restrictions limit our ability to transfer funds to or from our subsidiaries. In addition, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to us, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations, including our debt obligations. The majority of our capital is invested in our banking subsidiary E*TRADE Bank, which may not pay dividends to us without approval from the OCC and the Federal Reserve. Our primary brokerage subsidiaries, E*TRADE Securities LLC and E*TRADE Clearing LLC, are both subsidiaries of E*TRADE Bank; therefore, the OCC, together with the Federal Reserve, controls our ability to receive dividend payments from our brokerage business as well. Furthermore, even if we receive the approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve to receive dividend payments from our brokerage business, in the event of our bankruptcy or liquidation or E*TRADE Bank’s receivership, we would not be entitled to receive any cash or other property or assets from our subsidiaries (including E*TRADE Bank, E*TRADE Clearing LLC and E*TRADE Securities LLC) until those subsidiaries pay in full their respective creditors, including customers of those subsidiaries and, as applicable, the FDIC and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.  We submitted an initial long-term capital plan to the OCC and Federal Reserve during the second quarter of 2012. The plan included: our five-year business strategy; forecasts of our business results and capital ratios; capital distribution plans in current and adverse operating conditions; and internally developed stress tests.    12    Table of Contents  During the third quarter of 2012, we received initial feedback from our regulators on this plan and we believe that key elements of this plan, specifically reducing risk, deleveraging the balance sheet and the development of an enterprise risk management function, are critical. We submitted an updated long-term capital plan to the OCC and Federal Reserve in February 2013, which included the key elements outlined in the initial plan as well as the progress made during 2012 on those key elements. We believe we have made important progress on our long-term capital plan, as evidenced by the $100 million and $75 million dividends that our regulators approved from E*TRADE Bank during the third and fourth quarters of 2013, respectively, and the $75 million dividend approved in the first quarter of 2014. We plan to request a dividend each quarter over the near term up to the level of E*TRADE Bank’s net income from the previous quarter, while continuing an active and ongoing dialogue with our regulators to ensure our execution of the plan is consistent with their expectations. We cannot be certain that we will continue to receive regulatory approval for future dividends at consistent levels or at all.  E*TRADE Bank is also required to submit its first company-run stress test to assess the potential impact of hypothetical economic stress scenarios on consolidated earnings, losses and regulatory capital ratios over a nine-quarter planning horizon by March 31, 2014. The OCC will analyze the quality of E*TRADE Bank’s stress test process and results. While there is no formal mechanism for the OCC to “pass” or “fail” E*TRADE Bank’s stress test processes and results, it will likely consider these processes and results in evaluating proposed actions that may affect our bank’s capital, including but not limited to dividend payments, redemption or repurchase of regulatory capital instruments and mergers and acquisitions. If the OCC were to object to any such proposed action, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  We operate in a highly competitive industry where many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources.  The financial services industry is highly competitive, with multiple industry participants competing for the same customers. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater resources than we have and offer a wider range of financial products and services. Other of our competitors offer a more narrow range of financial products and services and have not been as susceptible to the disruptions in the credit markets that have impacted our Company, and therefore have not suffered the losses we have. The impact of competitors with superior name recognition, greater market acceptance, larger customer bases or stronger capital positions could adversely affect our revenue growth and customer retention. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and demands and withstand changing market conditions better than we can. Competitors may conduct extensive promotional activities, offering better terms, lower prices and/or different products and services or combination of products and services that could attract current E*TRADE customers and potentially result in price wars within the industry. Some of our competitors may also benefit from established relationships among themselves or with third parties enhancing their products and services.  In addition, we compete in a technology-intensive industry characterized by rapid innovation. We may be unable to effectively use new technologies, adopt our services to emerging industry standards or develop, introduce and market enhanced or new products and services. If we are not able to update or adapt our products and services to take advantage of the latest technologies and standards, or are otherwise unable to tailor the delivery of our services to the latest personal and mobile computing devices preferred by our retail customers, our business and financial performance could suffer.  Our ability to compete successfully in the financial services industry depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:        •    maintaining/expanding our market position;        •    retaining customers and maintaining customer satisfaction while attracting new customers;        •    providing easy to use and innovative financial products and services which appeal to retail investors;        •    our reputation and the market perception of our brand and overall value;        •    maintaining competitive pricing;    13    Table of Contents     •    adapting to an increasingly concentrated competitive landscape;        •    taking advantage of acquisition and other strategic opportunities;        •    the quality of our technology, products and services;        •    deploying a secure, and scalable technology and back office platform;        •    innovating effectively in launching new or enhanced products;        •    the differences in regulatory oversight regimes to which we and our competitors are subject;        •    attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees; and        •    general economic and industry trends.  Our competitive position within the industry could be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately address these factors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets could reduce trade volumes and margin borrowing and increase our dependence on our more active customers who receive lower pricing, resulting in lower revenues.  Online investing services to the retail customer, including trading and margin lending, account for a significant portion of our revenues. Turmoil in the global financial markets could lead to changes in volume and price levels of securities and futures transactions which may, in turn, result in lower trading volumes and margin lending. In particular, a decrease in trading activity within our lower activity accounts could impact revenues and increase dependence on more active trading customers who receive more favorable pricing based on their trade volume. A decrease in trading activity or securities prices would also typically be expected to result in a decrease in margin borrowing, which would reduce the revenue that we generate from interest charged on margin borrowing.  We rely heavily on technology, which can be subject to interruption and instability.  We rely on technology, particularly the Internet, to conduct much of our business activity. Our technology operations, including our primary and disaster recovery data center operations, are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters (such as fires, tornados, earthquakes and hurricanes), power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other malicious software, distributed denial of service attacks, spam attacks, security breaches and other similar events. Extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Disruptions to or instability of our technology or external technology that allows our customers to use our products and services could harm our business and our reputation. Should our technology operations be disrupted, we may have to make a significant investment to upgrade, repair or replace our technology infrastructure. While we have made significant investments to ensure the reliability of our operations, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain, expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to meet future requirements and mitigate future risks on a timely basis. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses, decreased client satisfaction and harm to our reputation. In addition, technology systems, including our own proprietary systems and the systems of third parties on whom we rely to conduct portions of our operations, are potentially vulnerable to security breaches and unauthorized usage. An actual or perceived breach of the security of our technology could harm our business and our reputation. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  Vulnerability of our customers’ computers and mobile devices could lead to significant losses related to identity theft or other fraud and harm our reputation and financial performance.  Because our business model relies heavily on our customers’ use of their own personal computers, mobile devices and the Internet, our business and reputation could be harmed by security breaches of our customers and third parties. Computer viruses and other attacks on our customers’ personal computer systems, home networks    14    Table of Contents  and mobile devices or against the third-party networks and systems of internet and mobile service providers could create losses for our customers even without any breach in the security of our systems, and could thereby harm our business and our reputation. As part of our E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee, we reimburse our customers for losses caused by a breach of security of our customers’ own personal systems. Such reimbursements could have a material impact on our financial performance.  Unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or those of our customers or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and reputational harm.  As part of our business, we are required to collect, use and store customer, employee and third party personally identifiable information (“PII”). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and account information. We maintain systems and procedures designed to securely process, transmit and store confidential information (including PII) and protect against unauthorized access to such information. We also require our third party vendors to have adequate security if they have access to PII. Despite these security measures, our systems, and those of our customers and third party vendors, may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism and computer viruses which could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data, an interruption in service or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of PII, whether by us or by our customers or third party vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a materially adverse effect on our business.  Downturns in the securities markets increase the credit risk associated with margin lending or securities loaned transactions.  We permit certain customers to purchase securities on margin. A downturn in securities markets may impact the value of collateral held in connection with margin receivables and may reduce its value below the amount borrowed, potentially creating collections issues with our margin receivables. In addition, we frequently borrow securities from and lend securities to other broker-dealers. Under regulatory guidelines, when we borrow or lend securities, we must simultaneously disburse or receive cash deposits. A sharp change in security market values may result in losses if counterparties to the borrowing and lending transactions fail to honor their commitments.  We may be unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates and the enterprise interest-earning assets in our portfolio.  Net operating interest income is an important source of our revenue. Our results of operations depend, in part, on our level of net operating interest income and our effective management of the impact of changing interest rates and varying asset and liability maturities. Our ability to manage interest rate risk could impact our financial condition. We use derivatives as hedging instruments to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations. However, the derivatives we utilize may not be completely effective at managing this risk and changes in market interest rates and the yield curve could reduce the value of our financial assets and reduce our net operating interest income.  Enterprise net interest spread may fluctuate based on the size and mix of the balance sheet, as well as the impact from changes in market interest rates. Among other items, we periodically enter into repurchase agreements to support the funding and liquidity requirements of E*TRADE Bank. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining our relationships with these counterparties, we could recognize substantial losses on the derivatives we utilized to hedge repurchase agreements.  If we do not successfully participate in consolidation opportunities, we could be at a competitive disadvantage.  There has recently been significant consolidation in the financial services industry and this consolidation is likely to continue in the future. Should we be excluded from or fail to take advantage of viable consolidation opportunities, our competitors may be able to capitalize on those opportunities and create greater scale and cost efficiencies to our detriment.    15    Table of Contents Although we are currently constrained by the terms of our corporate debt and the memoranda of understanding we and E*TRADE Bank entered into with our primary banking regulators, we may seek to acquire businesses in the future. The assets of businesses we have acquired in the past were primarily customer accounts. In future acquisitions, our retention of customers’ assets may be impacted by our ability to successfully integrate the acquired operations, products (including pricing) and personnel. Diversion of management attention from other business concerns could have a negative impact. If we are not successful in our integration efforts, we may experience significant attrition in the acquired accounts or experience other issues that would prevent us from achieving the level of revenue enhancements and cost savings that we expect with respect to an acquisition.  Advisory services subject us to additional risks.  We provide advisory services to investors to aid them in their decision making. Investment decisions and suggestions are based on publicly available documents and communications with investors regarding investment preferences and risk tolerances. Publicly available documents may be inaccurate and misleading, resulting in recommendations or transactions that are inconsistent with investors’ intended results. In addition, advisors may not understand investor needs or risk tolerances, which may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor. To the extent that we fail to know our customers or improperly advise them, we could be found liable for losses suffered by such customers, which could harm our reputation and business.  We have a significant deferred tax asset and cannot assure it will be fully realized.  We had net deferred tax assets of $1,239.0 million at December 31, 2013. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2013 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.  As a result of a registered offering of the Company’s common stock, an exchange of certain of the Company’s debt securities and related transactions in 2009, we believe that we experienced an “ownership change” for tax purposes that could cause us to permanently lose a significant portion of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets.  As a result of a registered offering of the Company’s common stock, an exchange of certain of the Company’s debt securities and related transactions in 2009, we believe that we experienced an “ownership change” as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”) (which is generally a greater than 50 percentage point increase by certain “5% shareholders” over a rolling three year period). Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of deferred tax assets, such as net operating loss carry forwards and other tax attributes, once an ownership change has occurred. Depending on the size of the annual limitation (which is in part a function of our market capitalization at the time of the ownership change) and the remaining carry forward period of the tax assets (U.S. federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for a period of 20 years), we could realize a permanent loss of a portion of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets and certain built-in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes. We believe the tax ownership change will extend the period of time it will take to fully utilize our pre-ownership change net operating losses (“NOLs”), but will not limit the total amount of pre-ownership change federal NOLs we can utilize. This is a complex analysis and requires the Company to make certain judgments in determining the annual limitation. As a result, it is possible that we could ultimately lose a significant portion of deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    16    Table of Contents Risks Relating to the Regulation of Our Business  We are subject to extensive government regulation, including banking and securities rules and regulations, which could restrict our business practices.  The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries must comply with many laws and rules, including rules relating to sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to customers, possession and control of customer funds and securities, margin lending, execution and settlement of transactions and anti-money laundering.  Similarly, E*TRADE Financial Corporation and ETB Holdings, Inc., as savings and loan holding companies, and E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Savings Bank, as federally chartered savings banks, are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and the Federal Reserve (including pursuant to the terms of the memoranda of understanding that E*TRADE Financial Corporation entered into with the Federal Reserve and that E*TRADE Bank entered into with the OCC) and, in the case of the savings banks, also the FDIC. Such regulation covers all banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, recordkeeping, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel.  While we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations and our policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, litigation, civil penalties and harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Recently enacted regulatory reform legislation may have a material impact on our operations. In addition, if we are unable to meet these new requirements, we could face negative regulatory consequences, which would have a material negative effect on our business.  On July 21, 2010, the President signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. This law contains various provisions designed to enhance financial stability and to reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis and significantly changed the bank regulatory structure for our Company and its thrift subsidiaries. Portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, but other portions will be effective following extended transition periods or through numerous rulemakings by multiple government agencies and many of those rulemakings have not yet been completed. While there continues to be uncertainty about the full impact of those changes, we do know that we will be subject to a more complex regulatory framework. We will also incur costs to comply with new requirements as well as to monitor for compliance in the future. The key effects of the Dodd-Frank Act, when fully implemented, on our business are:        •    changes to the thrift supervisory structure;        •    changes to regulatory capital requirements;        •    changes to the assessment base used by depository institutions to calculate their FDIC insurance premiums, increases in the minimum reserve ratio for the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund to 1.35%, and imposition of the additional costs of this increase on depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more; and        •    establishment of the CFPB with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and, for banks and thrifts with $10 billion or more in assets, to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws.  The Federal Reserve has primary jurisdiction for the supervision and regulation of savings and loan holding companies, including the Company; and the OCC has primary supervision and regulation of federal savings associations, such as the Company’s two thrift subsidiaries. Although the Dodd-Frank Act maintains the federal thrift charter, it eliminates certain preemption, branching and other benefits of the charter and imposes new penalties for failure to comply with the qualified thrift lender test. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires all    17    Table of Contents  companies, including savings and loan holding companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution, to serve as a source of strength for the institution, including committing necessary capital and liquidity support.  We are required to file periodic reports with the Federal Reserve and are subject to examination and supervision by it. The Federal Reserve also has certain types of enforcement powers over us, ETB Holdings, Inc., and our non-depository institution subsidiaries, including the ability to issue cease-and-desist orders, force divestiture of our thrift subsidiaries and impose civil and monetary penalties for violations of federal banking laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices. Our thrift subsidiaries are subject to similar reporting, examination, supervision and enforcement oversight by the OCC. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance aligning the supervisory and regulatory standards of savings and loan holding companies more closely with the standards applicable to bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve had also indicated that its supervision of savings and loan holding companies may entail a more rigorous level of review than previously applied by the OTS, which was eliminated by the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new independent regulatory body, the CFPB, which has been given broad rulemaking authority to implement the consumer protection laws that apply to banks and thrifts and to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. For all banks and thrifts with total consolidated assets over $10 billion, including E*TRADE Bank, the CFPB has exclusive rulemaking and examination, and primary enforcement authority, under federal consumer financial laws and regulations. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB.  For us, one of the most significant changes under the new law is that savings and loan holding companies such as our Company for the first time will become subject to the same capital and activity requirements as those applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, we will be subject to the same capital requirements as those applied to banks, which requirements exclude, on a phase-out basis, all trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital. The phase-in of the adopted rules is scheduled to begin in 2015, and we will be required to comply with the fully phased-in capital standards beginning in 2019. We fully expect to meet the capital requirements applicable to thrift holding companies as they are phased in. However, it is possible that our regulators may impose more stringent capital and other prudential standards on us prior to the end of the five year phase-in period. For example, both the OCC and the Federal Reserve have issued final regulations that will require E*TRADE Bank and will ultimately also require the parent company to conduct capital adequacy stress tests on their operations. E*TRADE Bank will be required to disclose a summary of these stress test results to the OCC on or before March 31, 2014 and the Company will ultimately also be required to disclose a summary of its stress test results to the Federal Reserve on or before March 31, 2017.  If we fail to comply with applicable securities and banking laws, rules and regulations, either domestically or internationally, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, damages, penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business.  The SEC, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions, among other things, can censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders or suspend or expel a broker-dealer or any of its officers or employees. The OCC and Federal Reserve may take similar action with respect to our banking and other financial activities, respectively. Similarly, the attorneys general of each state could bring legal action on behalf of the citizens of the various states to ensure compliance with local laws. Regulatory agencies in countries outside of the U.S. have similar authority. The ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is dependent in part on the establishment and maintenance of a reasonable compliance function. The failure to establish and enforce reasonable compliance procedures, even if unintentional, could subject us to significant losses or disciplinary or other actions.  During 2012, the Company completed a review of order handling practices and pricing for order flow between E*TRADE Securities LLC and G1 Execution Services, LLC. The Company has implemented the    18    Table of Contents  changes to its practices and procedures that were recommended during the review. Banking regulators and federal securities regulators were regularly updated during the course of the review and may initiate investigations into the Company’s historical practices which could subject it to monetary penalties and cease-and-desist orders, which could also prompt claims by customers of E*TRADE Securities LLC. Any of these actions could materially and adversely affect the Company’s broker-dealer businesses. On July 11, 2013, FINRA notified E*TRADE Securities LLC and G1 Execution Services, LLC that it is conducting an examination of both firms’ routing practices. The Company is cooperating fully with FINRA in this examination and, under the agreement governing the sale of G1 Execution Services, LLC to Susquehanna, remains responsible for any resulting actions taken against G1 Execution Services, LLC as a result of such investigation.  If we do not maintain the capital levels required by regulators, we may be fined or even forced out of business.  The SEC, FINRA, the OCC, the Federal Reserve and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of regulatory capital by banks and net capital by securities broker-dealers. E*TRADE Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OCC, and E*TRADE Financial Corporation will, for the first time, become subject to specific capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could harm E*TRADE Bank’s and E*TRADE Financial Corporation’s operations and financial statements.  E*TRADE Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of E*TRADE Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require E*TRADE Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 leverage. To satisfy the capital requirements for a “well capitalized” financial institution, E*TRADE Bank must maintain higher total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 leverage ratios. E*TRADE Bank’s capital amounts and classification are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about the strength of components of its capital, risk weightings of assets, off-balance sheet transactions and other factors. Any significant reduction in E*TRADE Bank’s regulatory capital could result in E*TRADE Bank being less than “well capitalized” or “adequately capitalized” under applicable capital rules. A failure of E*TRADE Bank to be “adequately capitalized” which is not cured within time periods specified in the indentures governing our debt securities would constitute a default under our debt securities and likely result in the debt securities becoming immediately due and payable at their full face value.  The regulators may request we raise equity to increase the regulatory capital of E*TRADE Bank or to further reduce debt. If we were unable to raise equity, we could face negative regulatory consequences, such as restrictions on our activities, requirements that we divest ourselves of certain businesses and requirements that we dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. Any such actions could have a material negative effect on our business.  Similarly, failure to maintain the required net capital by our securities broker-dealers could result in suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by FINRA, and could ultimately lead to the firm’s liquidation. If such net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require an intensive use of capital could be limited. Such operations may include investing activities, marketing and the financing of customer account balances. Also, our ability to withdraw capital from brokerage subsidiaries could be restricted.  In July 2013, the U.S. Federal banking agencies finalized a rule to implement Basel III in the U.S., a framework for the calculation and components of a banking organization’s regulatory capital and for calculating a banking organization’s risk-weighted assets. Among other things, the Basel III rule raises the minimum thresholds for required capital and revises certain aspects of the definitions and elements of the capital that can be used to satisfy these required minimum thresholds. While the rules became effective on January 1, 2014 for    19    Table of Contents  certain large banking organizations, most U.S. banking organizations including the Company and E*TRADE Bank, have until January 1, 2015 to begin complying with this new framework, with the fully phased-in Basel III capital standards becoming effective in 2019. We expect to be compliant with the Basel III framework, as it is phased-in.  We believe the most relevant elements of the final rule to us relate to the risk-weighting of mortgage loans, which will remain unchanged from current rules, and margin receivables, which will qualify for 0% risk-weighting. In addition, the final rule gives the option for a one-time permanent election for the inclusion or exclusion in the calculation of Common Tier 1 capital of unrealized gains (losses) on all available-for-sale debt securities, which we intend to elect to exclude unrealized gains (losses). We believe the incorporation of these elements will have a favorable impact on our current capital ratios.  On October 24, 2013, U.S. Federal banking agencies issued an inter-agency notice of proposed rulemaking that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement generally consistent with, and in some respects stricter than, the LCR standard established by Basel III. The purpose of the LCR proposal is to require certain financial institutions to hold minimum amounts of high-quality, liquid assets against its projected net cash outflows. While the LCR proposals would apply only to companies with greater than $50 billion in assets and would therefore not apply to us, we will continue to assess the impact of the proposed rule and we expect to be in compliance with this rule.  As a non-grandfathered savings and loan holding company, we are subject to activity limitations and requirements that could restrict our ability to engage in certain activities and take advantage of certain business opportunities.  Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, our activities are restricted to those that are financial in nature and certain real estate-related activities. We believe all of our existing activities and investments are permissible under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. At the same time, we are unable to pursue future activities that are not financial in nature or otherwise real-estate related. We are also limited in our ability to invest in other savings and loan holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires savings and loan holding companies like ours, as well as all of our thrift subsidiaries, to be both “well capitalized” and “well managed” in order for us to conduct certain financial activities, such as market making and securities underwriting. We believe that we will be able to continue to engage in all of our current financial activities. However, if we and our thrift subsidiaries are unable to satisfy the “well capitalized” and “well managed” requirements, we could be subject to activity restrictions that could prevent us from engaging in market making and securities underwriting, as well as other negative regulatory actions.  In addition, E*TRADE Bank is subject to extensive regulation of its activities and investments, capitalization, community reinvestment, risk management policies and procedures and relationships with affiliated companies. Acquisitions of and mergers with other financial institutions, purchases of deposits and loan portfolios, the establishment of new depository institution subsidiaries and the commencement of new activities by bank subsidiaries require the prior approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve, and in some cases the FDIC, which may deny approval or limit the scope of our planned activity. Our compliance with these regulations and conditions could place us at a competitive disadvantage in an environment in which consolidation within the financial services industry is prevalent. Also, these regulations and conditions could affect our ability to realize synergies from future acquisitions, negatively affect us following an acquisition and also delay or prevent the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services. In addition, E*TRADE Clearing LLC and E*TRADE Securities LLC, as operating subsidiaries of E*TRADE Bank, are subject to increased regulatory oversight and the same activity restrictions that are applicable to E*TRADE Bank.    20    Table of Contents Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock  Our business operations are substantially restricted by the terms of our corporate debt.  The indentures governing our corporate debt contain various covenants and restrictions that place limitations on our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:        •    incur additional indebtedness;        •    create liens;        •    pay dividends, make distributions or other payments;        •    repurchase or redeem capital stock;        •    make investments or other restricted payments;        •    enter into transactions with our shareholders or affiliates;        •    sell assets or shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries; and        •    merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets.  As a result of the covenants and restrictions contained in the indentures, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing at all or on terms sufficient to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. Each series of our corporate debt contains a limitation, subject to important exceptions, on our ability to incur additional debt if our Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the relevant indentures) is less than or equal to 2.5 to 1.0 under the terms of our outstanding convertible notes and 2.0 to 1.0 under the terms of our other outstanding series of notes. As of December 31, 2013, our Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was 4.4 to 1.0. The terms of any future indebtedness could include more restrictive covenants.  Although these covenants provide substantial flexibility, for example the ability to incur “refinancing indebtedness” and to incur up to $300 million of secured debt under a credit facility, the covenants, among other things, generally limit our ability to incur additional debt even if we were to substantially reduce our existing debt through debt exchange transactions. We could be forced to repay immediately all our outstanding debt securities at their full principal amount if we were to breach these covenants and did not cure such breach within the cure periods (if any) specified in the respective indentures. Further, if we experience a change of control, as defined in the indentures, we could be required to offer to purchase our debt securities at 101% of their principal amount. Under certain of our debt securities a “change of control” would occur if, among other things, a person became the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the total voting power of our voting stock which, with respect to the 6 3/4% senior notes due May 2016 (“6 3/4% Notes”), 6% senior notes due November 2017 (“6% Notes”) and 6 3/8% senior notes due November 2019 (“6 3/8% Notes”), would need to be coupled with a ratings downgrade before we would be required to offer to purchase those securities.  We cannot assure that we will be able to remain in compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to comply, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain waivers from the appropriate parties and/or amend the covenants.  The value of our common stock may be diluted if we need additional funds in the future.  In the future, we may need to raise additional funds via debt and/or equity instruments, which may not be available on favorable terms, if available at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our capital needs and our plans for the growth of our business. In addition, if funds are available, the issuance of equity securities could significantly dilute the value of our shares of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to fall. We have the ability to issue a significant number of shares of stock in future transactions, which would substantially dilute existing shareholders, without seeking further shareholder approval.    21    Table of Contents In recent periods, the global financial markets were in turmoil and the equity and credit markets experienced extreme volatility, which caused already weak economic conditions to worsen. Continued turmoil in the global financial markets could further restrict our access to the equity and debt markets.  The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.  From January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013, the price per share of our common stock ranged from a low of $7.08 to a high of $19.67. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In the past, volatility in the market price of a company’s securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. As discussed in Note 20—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, we were a party to litigation related to the decline in the market price of our stock and such litigation could occur again in the future. Declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also harm our ability to retain key employees, reduce our access to capital, impact our ability to utilize deferred tax assets in the event of another ownership change and otherwise harm our business.  We have provisions in our organizational documents that may discourage takeover attempts.  Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a shareholder may consider favorable. Such provisions include:        •    authorization for the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock;        •    the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors;        •    a super-majority voting requirement to effect business combinations and certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;        •    limits on the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders;        •    the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; and        •    advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings.  In addition, certain provisions of our stock incentive plans, management retention and employment agreements (including severance payments and stock option acceleration), certain provisions of Delaware law and the requirements under our debt securities to offer to purchase such securities at 101% of their principal amount may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us.  We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition, operating performance and our ability to receive dividend payments from our subsidiaries, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, regulatory approval and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness.  If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.    22    Table of Contents Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If our cash flows and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.
