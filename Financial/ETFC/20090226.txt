ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Risks Relating to the Nature and Operation of Our Business  We have incurred significant losses and cannot assure that we will be profitable  We incurred a net loss of $511.8 million, or $1.00 loss per share, for the year ended December 31, 2008, due primarily to losses in our home equity portfolio. Although we have taken a significant number of steps to reduce our credit exposure, we likely will continue to suffer significant credit losses in 2009 and 2010. In late 2007, we experienced a substantial diminution of customer assets and accounts as a result of customer concerns regarding our credit related exposures. While we were able to stabilize and return our retail franchise to growth during 2008, it could take a significant amount of time to fully mitigate the credit issues in our loan portfolio and return to profitability.  We will continue to experience losses in our mortgage loan portfolio  At December 31, 2008, the principal balance of our home equity loan portfolio was $10.0 billion. During 2008, the allowance for loan losses in this portfolio increased by $374.7 million to $833.8 million, primarily due to a rapid deterioration in performance in the second half of 2007 and continuing into 2008. While losses on the one-to-four family loan portfolio are much smaller in scope than the losses on the home equity loan portfolio, and may be offset somewhat by the value of the real estate held upon foreclosure, the allowance for loan losses in this portfolio increased by $166.3 million to $185.1 million during 2008. As the crisis in the residential real estate and credit markets continues, we expect credit losses to continue at historically high levels. There can be no assurance that our provision for loan losses will be adequate if the residential real estate and credit markets continue to deteriorate beyond our expectations. We may be required under such circumstances to further increase our provision for loan losses, which could have an adverse effect on our regulatory capital position and our results of operations in future periods.  We could experience significant losses on other securities held on the balance sheet of E*TRADE Bank  At December 31, 2008, we held $920.5 million in amortized cost of collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) on the consolidated balance sheet. While the majority of this portfolio remains AAA-rated, we incurred impairment charges of $95.0 million during 2008, which was a result of the deterioration in the expected credit performance of the underlying loans in the securities. In the event that these securities have a further decline in credit quality, this could result in additional impairment charges which would have an adverse effect on our regulatory capital position and our results of operations in future periods.  Losses of customers and assets could destabilize the Company or result in lower revenues in future periods  During November 2007, well-publicized concerns about the Bank’s holdings of asset-backed securities led to widespread concerns about our continued viability. From the beginning of this crisis through December 31, 2007 when the situation stabilized, customers withdrew approximately $5.6 billion of net cash and approximately $12.2 billion of net assets from our bank and brokerage businesses. Many of the accounts that were closed belonged to sophisticated and active customers with large cash and securities balances. While we were able to stabilize and return our retail franchise to growth in 2008, concerns about our viability may recur, which could lead to destabilization and asset and customer attrition. If such destabilization should occur, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully rebuild our franchise by reclaiming customers and growing assets. If we are not successful, our revenues and earnings in future periods will be lower than we have experienced historically.  We have a large amount of debt  We have issued a substantial amount of high-yield debt, with restrictive financial covenants, in connection with the Citadel Limited Partnership (“Citadel”) transaction in which we issued a total of approximately $2.1     6    Table of Contents  billion of 12 1/2% springing lien notes in 2007 and 2008. The annual interest cost of these securities alone is approximately $257 million. Our total long-term debt is $3.2 billion and the expected annual interest cash outlay is approximately $342 million, $257 million of which we have the option to pay in the form of additional 12  1/2% springing lien notes through May 2010. Our ratio of debt (our senior debt and term loans) to equity (expressed as a percentage) was 106% at December 31, 2008. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate needs is significantly limited; and (iii) our substantial leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage, hinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and make us more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in general economic conditions or our business. If regulatory requirements change in the future to impose capital ratios at the holding company level, we could be required to significantly restructure our capital position. In addition, a significant reduction in revenues could have a material adverse affect on our ability to meet our obligations under our debt securities.  We are subject to investigations and lawsuits as a result of our losses from mortgage loans and asset-backed securities  In 2007, we recognized an increased provision expense totaling $640 million and asset losses and impairments of $2.45 billion, including the sale of our asset-backed securities portfolio to Citadel. As a result, various plaintiffs filed class actions and derivative lawsuits, which have subsequently been consolidated into one class action and one derivative lawsuit, alleging disclosure violations regarding our home equity, mortgage and securities portfolios during 2007. In addition, the SEC initiated an informal inquiry into matters related to our loan and securities portfolios. The defense of these matters has and will continue to entail considerable cost and will be time-consuming for our management. Unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources  The financial services industry is highly competitive, with multiple industry participants competing for the same customers. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater resources than we do and offer a wider range of financial products and services. Other of our competitors offer a more narrow range of financial products and services and have not been as susceptible to the disruptions in the credit markets that have impacted our Company, and therefore have not suffered the losses we have. The impact of competitors with superior name recognition, greater market acceptance, larger customer bases or stronger capital positions could adversely affect our revenue growth and customer retention. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and demands and withstand changing market conditions better than we can. Competitors may conduct extensive promotional activities, offering better terms, lower prices and/or different products and services or combination of products and services that could attract current E*TRADE customers and potentially result in price wars within the industry. Some of our competitors may also benefit from established relationships among themselves or with third parties enhancing their products and services.  The continuing turmoil in the global financial markets could reduce trade volumes and margin borrowing and increase our dependence on our more active customers who receive lower pricing  Online investing services to the retail customer, including trading and margin lending, account for a significant portion of our revenues. The continuing turmoil in the global financial markets could lead to changes in volume and price levels of securities and futures transactions which may, in turn, result in lower trading volumes and margin lending. In particular, a decrease in trading activity within our lower activity accounts or our accounts related to stock plan administration products and services would significantly impact revenues and increase dependence on more active trading customers who receive more favorable pricing based on their trade volume. A decrease in trading activity or securities prices would also typically be expected to result in a decrease     7    Table of Contents  in margin borrowing, which would reduce the revenue that we generate from interest charged on margin borrowing. More broadly, any reduction in overall transaction volumes would likely result in lower revenues and may harm our operating results because many of our overhead costs are fixed.  We depend on payments from our subsidiaries  We depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including our debt obligations. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds to or from our subsidiaries. Many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to us, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations.  We rely heavily on technology, and technology can be subject to interruption and instability  We rely on technology, particularly the Internet, to conduct much of our activity. Our technology operations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, unauthorized access and other similar events. Disruptions to or instability of our technology or external technology that allows our customers to use our products and services could harm our business and our reputation. In addition, technology systems, whether they be our own proprietary systems or the systems of third parties on whom we rely to conduct portions of our operations, are potentially vulnerable to security breaches and unauthorized usage. An actual or perceived breach of the security of our technology could harm our business and our reputation.  Vulnerability of our customers’ computers could lead to significant losses related to identity theft or other fraud and harm our reputation and financial performance  Because our business model relies heavily on our customers’ use of their own personal computers and the Internet, our business and reputation could be harmed by security breaches of our customers and third parties. Computer viruses and other attacks on our customers’ personal computer systems could create losses for our customers even without any breach in the security of our systems, and could thereby harm our business and our reputation. As part of our E*TRADE Complete Protection Guarantee, we reimburse our customers for losses caused by a breach of security of the customers’ own personal systems. Such reimbursements could have a material impact on our financial performance.  Downturns in the securities markets increase the credit risk associated with margin lending or stock loan transactions  We permit customers to purchase securities on margin. A downturn in securities markets may impact the value of collateral held in connection with margin receivables and may reduce its value below the amount borrowed, potentially creating collections issues with our margin receivables. In addition, we frequently borrow securities from and lend securities to other broker-dealers. Under regulatory guidelines, when we borrow or lend securities, we must generally simultaneously disburse or receive cash deposits. A sharp change in security market values may result in losses if counterparties to the borrowing and lending transactions fail to honor their commitments.  We may be unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates and the enterprise interest-earning assets in our portfolio  Net operating interest income has become an increasingly important source of our revenue. Our ability to manage interest rate risk could impact our financial condition. Our results of operations depend, in part, on our level of net operating interest income and our effective management of the impact of changing interest rates and     8    Table of Contents  varying asset and liability maturities. We use derivatives to help manage interest rate risk. However, the derivatives we utilize may not be completely effective at managing this risk and changes in market interest rates and the yield curve could reduce the value of our financial assets and reduce net operating interest income. Among other items, we periodically enter into repurchase agreements to support the funding and liquidity requirements of our Bank. Several market participants have reduced or terminated their participation in the repurchase agreement market. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining our relationships with counterparties, we could recognize substantial losses on the derivatives we utilized to hedge repurchase agreements.  If we do not successfully manage consolidation opportunities, we could be at a competitive disadvantage  There has recently been significant consolidation in the financial services industry and this consolidation is likely to continue in the future. Should we be excluded from or fail to take advantage of viable consolidation opportunities, our competitors may be able to capitalize on those opportunities and create greater scale and cost efficiencies to our detriment.  We have acquired a number of businesses and, although currently constrained by the terms of our corporate debt, may continue to acquire businesses in the future. The primary assets of these businesses are their customer accounts. Our retention of these assets and the customers of businesses we acquire may be impacted by our ability to successfully continue to integrate the acquired operations, products (including pricing) and personnel. Diversion of management attention from other business concerns could have a negative impact. In the event that we are not successful in our continued integration efforts, we may experience significant attrition in the acquired accounts or experience other issues that would prevent us from achieving the level of revenue enhancements and cost savings that we expect with respect to an acquisition.  Risks associated with principal trading transactions could result in trading losses  A majority of our market-making revenues are derived from trading as a principal. We may incur trading losses relating to the purchase, sale or short sale of securities for our own account, as well as trading losses in our market maker stocks. From time to time, we may have large positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry. Sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial results.  Reduced spreads in securities pricing, levels of trading activity and trading through market makers could harm our market maker business  Computer-generated buy/sell programs and other technological advances and regulatory changes in the marketplace may continue to tighten securities spreads. Tighter spreads could reduce revenue capture per share by our market maker, thus reducing revenues for this line of business.  Advisory services subject us to additional risks  We provide advisory services to investors to aid them in their decision making and also provide full service portfolio management. Investment decisions and suggestions are based on publicly available documents and communications with investors regarding investment preferences and risk tolerances. Publicly available documents may be inaccurate and misleading, resulting in recommendations or transactions that are inconsistent with the investors’ intended results. In addition, advisors may not understand investor needs or risk tolerances, failures that may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor. To the extent that we fail to know our customers or improperly advise them, we could be found liable for losses suffered by such customers, which could harm our reputation and business.  Our international operations subject us to additional risks and regulation, which could impair our business growth  We conduct business in a number of international locations, sometimes through joint venture and/or licensee relationships. Action or inaction in any of these operations, including the failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance and/or corporate governance, could harm our operations and/or our reputation.    9    Table of Contents We have a significant deferred tax asset and cannot assure it will be fully realized  We had net deferred tax assets of $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2008. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our federal net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimated future taxable income based on management approved forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, a valuation allowance may need to be established, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our regulatory capital position at E*TRADE Bank. In addition, a significant portion of the net deferred tax asset relates to a $2.3 billion federal tax loss carryforward, the utilization of which may be further limited in the event of certain material changes in the ownership of the Company.  Risks Relating to the Regulation of Our Business  We are subject to extensive government regulation, including banking and securities rules and regulations, which could restrict our business practices  The securities and banking industries are subject to extensive regulation. All of our broker-dealer subsidiaries have to comply with many laws and rules, including rules relating to sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to customers, possession and control of customer funds and securities, margin lending, execution and settlement of transactions and anti money-laundering. We are also subject to additional laws and rules as a result of our market maker operations.  Similarly, E*TRADE Financial Corporation and ETB Holdings, Inc., as savings and loan holding companies, and E*TRADE Bank, E*TRADE Savings Bank and United Medical Bank, as federally chartered savings banks, are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OTS and, in the case of the savings banks, also the FDIC. Such regulation covers all banking business, including lending practices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, recordkeeping, transactions with affiliates and conduct and qualifications of personnel.  If we fail to comply with applicable securities and banking laws, rules and regulations, either domestically or internationally, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, damages, penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business  The SEC, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions, among other things, can censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders or suspend or expel a broker-dealer or any of its officers or employees. The OTS may take similar action with respect to our banking activities. Similarly, the attorneys general of each state could bring legal action on behalf of the citizens of the various states to ensure compliance with local laws. Regulatory agencies in countries outside of the U.S. have similar authority. The ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is dependent in part on the establishment and maintenance of a reasonable compliance system. The failure to establish and enforce reasonable compliance procedures, even if unintentional, could subject us to significant losses or disciplinary or other actions.  If we do not maintain the capital levels required by regulators, we may be fined or even forced out of business  The SEC, FINRA, OTS and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker-dealers and regulatory capital by banks. Net capital is the net worth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain types of assets. Failure to maintain the required net capital could result in suspension or revocation of registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by FINRA, and could ultimately lead to the firm’s liquidation. In the past, our broker-dealer subsidiaries have depended largely on capital contributions by us in order to comply with net capital requirements. If such net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge     10    Table of Contents  against net capital, operations that require an intensive use of capital could be limited. Such operations may include investing activities, marketing and the financing of customer account balances. Also, our ability to withdraw capital from brokerage subsidiaries could be restricted, which in turn could limit our ability to repay debt and redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock.  Similarly, the Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OTS. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could harm a bank’s operations and financial statements. A bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of a bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about the strength of components of its capital, risk weightings of assets, off-balance sheet transactions and other factors.  Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require a bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 Capital to Risk-weighted Assets and of Tier 1 Capital to adjusted total assets. To satisfy the capital requirements for a “well capitalized” financial institution, a bank must maintain higher Total and Tier 1 Capital to Risk-weighted Assets and Tier 1 Capital to adjusted total assets ratios.  As a non-grandfathered savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulations that could restrict our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities  We are required to file periodic reports with the OTS and are subject to examination by the OTS. The OTS also has certain types of enforcement powers over us, ETB Holdings, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries, including the ability to issue cease-and-desist orders, force divestiture of the Bank and impose civil and monetary penalties for violations of federal banking laws and regulations or for unsafe or unsound banking practices. In addition, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, our activities are restricted to those that are financial in nature and certain real estate-related activities. We may make merchant banking investments in companies whose activities are not financial in nature if those investments are made for the purpose of appreciation and ultimate resale of the investment and we do not manage or operate the company. Such merchant banking investments may be subject to maximum holding periods and special recordkeeping and risk management requirements. In 2007, the Company moved its subsidiary, E*TRADE Clearing, LLC to become an operating subsidiary of E*TRADE Bank, resulting in increased regulatory oversight and restrictions on the activities of E*TRADE Clearing, LLC.  We believe all of our existing activities and investments are permissible under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, but the OTS has not yet fully interpreted these provisions. Even if our existing activities and investments are permissible, we are unable to pursue future activities that are not financial in nature. We are also limited in our ability to invest in other savings and loan holding companies.  In addition, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation of its activities and investments, capitalization, community reinvestment, risk management policies and procedures and relationships with affiliated companies. Acquisitions of and mergers with other financial institutions, purchases of deposits and loan portfolios, the establishment of new Bank subsidiaries and the commencement of new activities by Bank subsidiaries require the prior approval of the OTS, and in some cases the FDIC, which may deny approval or limit the scope of our planned activity. These regulations and conditions could place us at a competitive disadvantage in an environment in which consolidation within the financial services industry is prevalent. Also, these regulations and conditions could affect our ability to realize synergies from future acquisitions, could negatively affect us following the acquisition and could also delay or prevent the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services.    11    Table of Contents Risks Relating to Owning Our Stock  We are substantially restricted by the terms of our corporate debt  In June 2004, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million of senior notes due June 2011. In September and November 2005, we issued an additional aggregate principal amount of $100 million of senior notes due June 2011, $600 million of senior notes due September 2013 and $300 million of senior notes due December 2015. In November 2007 and January 2008, we issued a total of $2.1 billion of 12 1/2% springing lien notes due 2017. The indentures governing these notes contain various covenants and restrictions that limit our ability and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:        •    incur additional indebtedness;        •    create liens;        •    pay dividends or make other distributions;        •    repurchase or redeem capital stock;        •    make investments or other restricted payments;        •    enter into transactions with our stockholders or affiliates;        •    sell assets or shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries;        •    receive dividend or other payments from our subsidiaries; and        •    merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets.  As a result of the covenants and restrictions contained in the indentures, we are limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. Each of these series of senior notes contain a limitation, subject to important exceptions, on our ability to incur additional debt if our Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2008, our Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio was (0.5) to 1.0. The terms of any future indebtedness could include more restrictive covenants.  We cannot assure that we will be able to remain in compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the appropriate parties and/or amend the covenants.  The interests of our largest shareholder may conflict with the interests of other shareholders  At December 31, 2008, Citadel owned approximately 89.4 million shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 16% of the outstanding shares. In addition, Citadel is our largest creditor through its ownership of approximately $2.1 billion of our corporate debt. Citadel is an independent entity with its own investors and is entitled to act in its own economic interest with respect to its equity and debt investments in E*TRADE. For example, following April 29, 2008, Citadel was generally free under the terms of the Investment Agreement to sell the equity securities it received under the Investment Agreement and any such sales may have a depressing effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, Citadel’s 12  1/2% springing lien notes contain restrictive covenants and as a holder of in excess of a majority of the springing lien notes, Citadel has a right to declare defaults and enforce remedies just like any other lender for so long as Citadel retains a majority of the springing lien notes. Finally, in pursuing its economic interests, Citadel may make decisions with respect to fundamental corporate transactions which may be different than the decisions of shareholders who own only common shares.  The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile  From January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2008, the price per share of our common stock ranged from a low of $0.79 to a high of $27.76. The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. In the past, volatility in the market price of a company’s     12    Table of Contents  securities has often led to securities class action litigation. Such litigation could result in substantial costs to us and divert our attention and resources, which could harm our business. As discussed in Note 23—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, the Company is currently a party to litigation related to the decline in the market price of our stock, and such litigation could occur again in the future. Declines in the market price of our common stock or failure of the market price to increase could also harm our ability to retain key employees, reduce our access to capital and otherwise harm our business.  We may need additional funds in the future, which may not be available and which may result in dilution of the value of our common stock  In the future, we may need to raise additional funds via debt and/or equity instruments, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our plans for the growth of our business. In addition, if funds are available, the issuance of equity securities could significantly dilute the value of our shares of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to fall.  During the second half of 2008, the global financial markets were in turmoil and the equity and credit markets experienced extreme volatility, which caused already weak economic conditions to worsen. Continued turmoil in the global financial markets could further restrict our access to the public equity and debt markets.  In October 2008, we applied to participate in the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) Capital Purchase Program established under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. To date, our application has not been approved or rejected. If our application is approved, the acceptance of this funding by us would result in significant dilution to the holders of our common stock as the terms of this program would require us to issue equity instruments to the federal government. In addition, the approval would likely be conditional upon additional capital raising activities by us, including possible transactions with existing security holders, which likely would result in further substantial dilution to the holders of our common stock. We expect that our participation in the TARP program will require bondholder consent and any additional capital raising activities may require stockholder approval. No assurance can be given that our TARP application will be approved or that we will receive bondholder consent or stockholder approval, if required. Recent announcements by the U.S. Treasury have indicated that there will be changes to the program going forward, and our application may be approved under a program with different terms than those of the current Capital Purchase Program. If our application is not approved, customers could view this as a negative assessment of our viability, which could in turn lead to destabilization and asset and customer attrition.  We have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts  Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us in a merger, acquisition or similar transaction that a shareholder may consider favorable. Such provisions include:        •    authorization for the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock;        •    provision for a classified Board of Directors (“Board”) with staggered, three-year terms;        •    the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors;        •    a super-majority voting requirement to effect business combinations or certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;        •    limits on the persons who may call special meetings of shareholders;        •    the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent; and        •    advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings.    13    Table of Contents Attempts to acquire control of the Company may also be delayed or prevented by our stockholder rights plan, which is designed to enhance the ability of our Board to protect shareholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of the Company that do not offer an adequate price to all shareholders or are otherwise not in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. In addition, certain provisions of our stock incentive plans, management retention and employment agreements (including severance payments and stock option acceleration), and Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us.
