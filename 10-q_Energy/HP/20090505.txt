Item 1A. Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 26, 2008, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2008, and the percentage of the May 1, 2009 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2009:      Reportable       Total Backlog       Percentage Not Reasonably         Segment       05/01/2009       10/31/2008       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2009                 (in billions)                                                   U.S. Land       $   2.251       $   2.876       80.7   %     Offshore       .173       .199       86.7   %     International Land       .282       .299       87.9   %             $   2.706       $   3.374                  Capital Resources   During the six months ended March 31, 2009, the Company announced commitments to build 13 new FlexRigs for locations in the United States. These 13 contracts have term durations ranging from three to four years. These 13, along with the 127 rigs announced in fiscal years 2005 through 2008 brings the Company’s commitments to a total of 140 new FlexRigs. Eight of these 140 new rigs were contracted for work in International Land operations and the remaining 132 in U.S. Land operations. The drilling services are performed on a daywork contract basis. Through the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2009, 122 rigs were completed for delivery, and 111 of the 122 had begun field operations. The remaining rigs are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2010.   32      Table of Contents   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS March 31, 2009   Capital expenditures were $525.9 million and $321.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures increased from 2008 primarily due to the Company’s current construction program of new FlexRigs. Given the Company’s commitments with suppliers, the capital expenditure estimate is approximately $850 million for fiscal 2009, including construction of new FlexRigs.   There were no other significant changes in the Company’s financial position since September 30, 2008.   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   Material commitments as reported in the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K have not changed significantly at March 31, 2009.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   The Company’s accounting policies that are “critical” or the most important to understand the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require management of the Company to make the most difficult judgments are described in the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies other than the adoption of SFAS No. 157, SFAS No. 159, and EITF 06-11 on October 1, 2008. The adoption of these did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The additional disclosures required by SFAS No. 157 are included in Note 9, Fair Value Measurements.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF, Issue No. 08-6, Equity-Method Investment Accounting. EITF 08-6 concludes that the cost basis of a new equity-method investment would be determined using a cost-accumulation mode, which would continue the practice of including transaction costs in the cost of investment and would exclude the value of contingent consideration. Equity-method investment should be subject to other-than-temporary impairment analysis. It also requires that a gain or loss be recognized on the portion of the investor’s ownership sold. EITF 08-6 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of EITF 08-6 may have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities, to clarify that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are participating securities. An entity must include participating securities in its calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method pursuant to SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating FSP EITF 03-6-1 to determine the impact, if any, on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 142-3, Determining the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP SFAS 142-3). FSP SFAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. This FSP must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. Accordingly, the Company will adopt FSP SFAS 142-3 in fiscal year 2010.   33      Table of Contents   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS March 31, 2009   In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (the FSP). The FSP amends SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, to delay the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). For items within its scope, the FSP defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the FSP to determine the impact, if any, on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51. Both of these standards are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141(R) will be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring after the effective date. Earlier application is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 160 but does not expect its adoption to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statement.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Companies are not allowed to adopt SFAS No. 159 on a retrospective basis unless they choose early adoption. The Company adopted SFAS No. 159 on October 1, 2008, and did not elect the fair value option for eligible items that existed at the date of adoption.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value, sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurements, and requires new disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSPs No. 157-1 and No. 157-2, which, respectively, removed leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157 and deferred for one year the effective date for SFAS No. 157 as it applies to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities. On October 1, 2008, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the SFAS No. 157 definition of fair value and became subject to the new disclosure requirements (excluding FSP 157-2) with respect to our fair value measurements of (a) nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in our financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and (b) all financial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not impact the consolidated financial position or results of operations. The additional disclosures required by SFAS No. 157 are included in Note 9, Fair Value Measurements.   The deferral provided by FSP No. 157-2 applies to such items as nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination (but not measured at fair value in subsequent periods) and nonfinancial long-lived asset groups measured at fair value for an impairment assessment. The Company is currently evaluating the impact FSP No. 157-2 will have on nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, which are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.   34      Table of Contents   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS March 31, 2009   On October 1, 2008, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards (“EITF 06-11”). EITF 06-11 requires companies to recognize a realized income tax benefit associated with dividends or dividend equivalents paid on nonvested equity-classified employee share-based payment awards that are charged to retained earnings as an increase to additional paid-in capital. The adoption of EITF 06-11 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The FSP amends SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments to require disclosure about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements. FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009. The Company will include the disclosures required under this FSP beginning in the June 30, 2009 Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. The adoption of FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 will have no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments. The Company has determined that only the provisions of FAS 124-2 are currently applicable. FSP No. 124-2 expands and increases the frequency of existing disclosures about other-than-temporary impairments for debt and equity securities. It is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Management does not currently believe the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results.   35      Table of Contents   PART I.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 26, 2008; · Note 8 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to interest rate risk are incorporated herein by reference; and · Note 3 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to credit risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk are incorporated herein by reference.   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2009, at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting.   36      Table of Contents   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   In the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company disclosed that in connection with the Company’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act training, questions were raised about the legality of certain past payments by one of the Company’s subsidiaries in connection with the passage of materials through customs in Latin America. In consultation with the Audit and Governance Committees of the Board of Directors, the Company engaged outside counsel and outside accountants to review these payments, other transactions of the subsidiary, and transactions at certain of the Company’s other operations in Latin America. The Company contacted the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice to inform them of this matter, and has cooperated fully with these governmental authorities.   The potential damages and penalties the Company might incur if it was determined that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) include civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation of the anti-bribery provisions and criminal penalties of up to the greater of $2 million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain resulting from any improper conduct and other sanctions. A company that knowingly commits a violation of the accounting provisions can be fined up to $25 million. It is also possible that governmental agencies could require that the Company enter into a criminal plea agreement, deferred prosecution agreement, or other settlement, which could include monitoring requirements and potentially other sanctions.   Outside counsel has completed its Latin American review and the Company is now in the preliminary stages of discussions with the Enforcement Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission and with the Department of Justice about an amicable resolution of this matter. The Company cannot predict the outcome of those discussions. However, based on the results of the Company’s investigation, the status of the preliminary discussions with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the expectations of the Company’s external FCPA legal counsel, the Company believes there is no basis to predict that the fines and penalties will be material to the Company or its financial statements. This belief is based on the total nature and amount of the questionable payments that the investigation uncovered, the fact that the matter was voluntarily disclosed by the Company, and the Company’s ongoing cooperation with the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of a particular oil company operator’s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the Company’s operations or on the ability of the Company to continue operations in certain areas.   Because of the impact of local laws, the Company’s future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which the Company holds only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which the Company conducts operations under contract to local entities. While the Company believes that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that the Company will in all cases be able to structure or restructure its operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to the Company.   37      Table of Contents   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   Venezuela continues to experience significant political, economic and social instability. In the event that extended labor strikes occur or turmoil increases, the Company could experience shortages in labor and/or materials and supplies necessary to operate some or all of its Venezuelan drilling rigs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.   During the mid-1970s, the Venezuelan government nationalized the exploration and production business. More recently, Venezuela has nationalized some industries unrelated to the oilfield services industry. At the present time it appears the Venezuelan government will not nationalize the contract drilling business. Any such nationalization could result in the Company’s loss of all or a portion of its assets and business in Venezuela.   Although the Company attempts to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the six months ended March 31, 2009, approximately 13 percent of the Company’s consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During the six months ended March 31, 2009, approximately 95 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America and approximately 62 percent of South American operating revenues were from Venezuela and Colombia.   Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to currency devaluation risk and receivable balances in Venezuela, interest rate risk and the Company’s securities portfolio in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2008. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first six months of fiscal 2009, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of, Notes 3, 5, 8, 12 and 17 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof.   Except as discussed above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2008.   ITEM 4.
