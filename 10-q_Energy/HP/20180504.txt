Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, regarding fixed term contract risk.           43     Table of Contents     Capital Resources       With continuing improvements in market conditions, our capital spending for fiscal 2018 is estimated to be in the range of approximately $400 million to $450 million. The actual spending level may vary depending primarily on actual maintenance capital requirements and market driven special projects related to the future enhancement of our existing fleet. Capital expenditures were $191.2 million and $175.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. During fiscal 2018, we continued to upgrade existing rigs to meet customer demands for additional capabilities.       There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2017.       MATERIAL COMMITMENTS       Material commitments as reported in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K have not changed significantly at March 31, 2018.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       Our accounting policies and estimates that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management to make the most difficult judgments, are described in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies and estimates.       RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS       See Note 1 and Note 16 of these Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting standards and new accounting standards not yet adopted.                                  44     Table of Contents     ITEM 3.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2018 at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.       PART II. OTHER INFORMATION       ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       Investigation by the U.S. Attorney. On November 8, 2013, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana approved the previously disclosed October 30, 2013 plea agreement between our wholly owned subsidiary, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. (“HPIDC”), and the United States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana (“DOJ”). The court’s approval of the plea agreement resolved the DOJ’s investigation into certain choke manifold testing irregularities that occurred in 2010 at one of HPIDC’s offshore platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. We also engaged in discussions with the Inspector General’s office of the Department of the Interior (“DOI”) regarding the same events that were the subject of the DOJ’s investigation. Although we do not presently anticipate any further action by the DOI in this matter, we can provide no assurance as to the timing or eventual outcome of the DOI’s consideration of the matter.       Venezuela Expropriation. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, HPIDC and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, C.A. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 23, 2011 against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. and PDVSA Petroleo, S.A. We are seeking damages for the taking of our Venezuelan drilling business in violation of international law and for breach of contract. While there exists the possibility of realizing a recovery, we are currently unable to determine the timing or amounts we may receive, if any, or the likelihood of recovery.       ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS        Our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, which is significantly impacted by the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and other factors.       Our business depends on the conditions of the land and offshore oil and natural gas industry. Demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly     45     Table of Contents  affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations regarding potential changes to these prices, significantly affect oil and natural gas industry activity.       We are subject to the political, economic and social instability risks and local laws associated with doing business in certain foreign countries.       We currently have operations in South America and the Middle East. In the future, we may further expand the geographic reach of our operations. As a result, we are exposed to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social unrest, strikes, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contract provisions, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the markets in which we operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.       South American countries, in particular, have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability. From time to time these risks have impacted our business. For example, on June 30, 2010, the Venezuelan government expropriated 11 rigs and associated real and personal property owned by our Venezuelan subsidiary. Prior thereto, we also experienced currency devaluation losses in Venezuela and difficulty repatriating U.S. dollars to the United States. Today, our contracts for work in foreign countries generally provide for payment in U.S. dollars. However, in Argentina we are paid in Argentine pesos. The Argentine branch of one of our second-tier subsidiaries then remits U.S. dollars to its U.S. parent by converting the Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars through the Argentine Foreign Exchange Market and repatriating the U.S. dollars.        We are not operating in any country that is currently considered highly inflationary, which is defined as cumulative inflation rates exceeding 100 percent in the most recent three-year period based on inflation data published by the respective governments. However, estimates from other published sources may indicate that Argentina is a highly inflationary country. Nonetheless, all of our foreign operations use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency and local currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars with gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions included in current results of operations.       In December 2015, the Argentine peso experienced a sharp devaluation resulting in an aggregate foreign currency loss of $8.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Subsequent to the devaluation, the Argentine peso stabilized and the Argentine Foreign Exchange Market controls now place fewer restrictions on repatriating U.S. dollars. These changes have reduced our current foreign currency exchange rate risk in Argentina. For the six months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, we experienced aggregate foreign currency losses of $1.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively. However, in the future, we may incur larger currency devaluations, foreign exchange restrictions or other difficulties repatriating U.S. dollars in Argentina or elsewhere which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.       Additionally, there can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas. Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.       Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the six months ended March 31, 2018, approximately 10.1 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were     46     Table of Contents  generated from the international contract drilling business. During the six months ended March 31, 2018, approximately 95.8 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America. Substantially all of the South American operating revenues were from Argentina and Colombia. The future occurrence of one or more international events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.       Other risk factors       Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to the Company’s securities portfolio and current backlog of contract drilling revenue in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first six months of fiscal 2018, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of Note 5 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof (regarding our securities portfolio) and Liquidity and Capital Resources — Backlog contained in Item 2 of Part I hereof.       Except as discussed above for the six months ended March 31, 2018, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K.              47     Table of Contents         ITEM 6.
