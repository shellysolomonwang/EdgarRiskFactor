Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   26      Table of Contents   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of June 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013, and the percentage of the June 30, 2014 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2014:              Three Months Ended                         June 30,       September 30,       Percentage Not Reasonably         Reportable Segment       2014       2013       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2014                 (in billions)                                                   U.S. Land        $   3.5       $   2.4       88.5   %     Offshore        0.1       0.1       93.1   %     International Land        1.2       0.4       95.3   %             $   4.8       $   2.9                  Capital Resources   Since September 30, 2013, we have announced that we had secured multi-year term contracts to build and operate 74 new FlexRigs with 17 customers in the U.S. We expect to increase our construction cadence from three to four rigs per month beginning September 2014. During the nine months ended June 30, 2014, we placed into service 33 new FlexRigs. In addition, we completed a new 3,000 horsepower AC drive rig which is scheduled to begin operations in an international location in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Four additional new FlexRigs under fixed term contract were placed into service by July 31, 2014. Like those completed and placed into service in prior fiscal periods, each of the 74 new FlexRigs is committed to work for an exploration and production company under a fixed term contract, performing drilling services on a daywork contract basis.   Our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2014 is expected to be slightly under our previous estimate of $1.1 billion. However, the actual spending level may vary depending primarily on actual maintenance capital requirements and on the timing of procurement related to our ongoing newbuild efforts. Capital expenditures were $622.0 million and $618.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2013.   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   Material commitments as reported in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, has not changed significantly at June 30, 2014.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Our accounting policies that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   On October 1, 2013, we adopted ASU 2013-02, Other Comprehensive Income. ASU No. 2013-02 amended ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, and superseded and replaced ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, and ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income. The standard did not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, the guidance does require an entity to provide enhanced disclosures to present separately by component reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The adoption had no impact on the amount of OCI reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance. The new standard requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The provisions of ASU 2014-09 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and we have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach when adopting this new standard. We are currently evaluating the alternative transition methods and the potential effects of the adoption of this update on our financial statements.   27      Table of Contents   PART I.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2014 at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   Investigation by the U.S. Attorney. On November 8, 2013, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana approved the previously disclosed October 30, 2013 plea agreement between our wholly owned subsidiary, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co., and the United States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana (“DOJ”). The court’s approval of the plea agreement resolved the DOJ’s investigation into certain choke manifold testing irregularities that occurred in 2010 at one of Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co.’s offshore platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. We are engaged in discussions with the Inspector General’s office of the Department of Interior regarding the same events that were the subject of the DOJ’s investigation. Although we presently believe that the outcome of our discussions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company, we can provide no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of these discussions.   Venezuela Expropriation. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, C.A. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 23, 2011 against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PDVSA”) and PDVSA Petroleo, S.A. (“Petroleo”). We are seeking damages for the taking of our Venezuelan drilling business in violation of international law and for breach of contract. While there exists the possibility of realizing a recovery, we are currently unable to determine the timing or amounts we may receive, if any, or the likelihood of recovery.   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   International uncertainties and local laws could adversely affect our business.   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of drilling rigs, equipment, land and other property, as well as expropriation of a particular oil company’s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas.   28      Table of Contents   Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to us.   Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the nine months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 10 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During the nine months ended June 30, 2014, approximately 75 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America.   Other risk factors.   Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to the Company’s securities portfolio and current backlog of contract drilling revenue in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended September 30, 2013. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first nine months of fiscal 2014, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of Note 4 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof and Liquidity and Capital Resources — Backlog contained in Item 2 of Part I hereof.   Except as discussed above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended September 30, 2013.   ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION   On June 4, 2014, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Amended and Restated By-Laws of Helmerich &Payne, Inc. (the “By-Laws”). The By-Laws as so amended became effective June 4, 2014. Article II, Section 11 of the By-Laws provides, in part, the manner in which a stockholder may bring a matter before a stockholder meeting. Article II, Section 11 requires a stockholder to submit a notice to the Company containing certain information pertinent to the stockholder proposal or nomination of a director. The By-Laws have been amended by adding clause (vii) to Article II, Section 11(c). Clause (vii) provides that, as part of the stockholder’s notice concerning the nomination of a director, the director nominee must represent and agree (on a form provided by the Company) that he or she (i) is not and will not become a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding and has given no commitment as to how, if elected, such person will vote as a director (except as disclosed to the Company) and has no and will not have a voting commitment that might interfere with the director’s fiduciary duties, (ii) is not and will not be a party to any agreement, arrangement or understanding to accept compensation (other than from the Company) in connection with his or her service as a director (except as disclosed to the Company), and (iii) will comply with all publicly disclosed corporate governance, confidentiality and other policies of the Company if elected. The foregoing description of the amendment to the By-Laws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the By-Laws, as amended, that are attached as Exhibit 3.1 to the Company’s Form 8-K/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 9, 2014.   29      Table of Contents   ITEM 6.
