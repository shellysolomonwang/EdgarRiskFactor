Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2014, and the percentage of the March 31, 2015 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2015:              Three Months Ended                         March 31,       September 30,       Percentage Not Reasonably         Reportable Segment       2015       2014       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2015                 (in billions)                                                   U.S. Land        $   2.9       $   3.8       77.7   %     Offshore        0.1       0.1       82.1   %     International Land        0.9       1.1       84.6   %             $   3.9       $   5.0                  Capital Resources   Since September 30, 2014, we have announced that we had secured multi-year term contracts to build and operate six new FlexRigs with two customers in the U.S. During the six months ended March 31, 2015, we completed 24 new FlexRigs. Four additional new FlexRigs under fixed-term contract were completed by April 23, 2015. Like those completed and placed into service in prior fiscal periods, each of the new FlexRigs is committed to work for an exploration and production company under a fixed-term contract, performing drilling services on a daywork contract basis.   Our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2015 is expected to total approximately $1.3 billion. The monthly cadence of the new FlexRig construction program is expected to decline from four to two rigs per month beginning in June 2015 through the end of September 2015, and then decline from two to one rig per month beginning October 2015 through March 2016. However, the actual spending level may vary depending primarily on actual maintenance capital requirements and on the timing of procurement related to our ongoing newbuild efforts. All new FlexRigs scheduled for delivery during calendar 2015 and 2016 are supported with multi-year contracts. Capital expenditures were $763.4 million and $356.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2014.   29      Table of Contents   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   In March 2015, we issued $500 million unsecured senior notes. The debt and estimated interest increases the material commitments reported in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K by approximately $732 million which has annual interest of approximately $23.2 million through March 2025.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Our accounting policies that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance. The new standard requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The provisions of ASU 2014-09 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and we have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach when adopting this new standard. We are currently evaluating the alternative transition methods and the potential effects of the adoption of this update on our financial statements.   In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-03 “Interest — Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs”. ASU No. 2015-03 amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) to require that debt issuance cost be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related liability. Prior to the amendment, debt issuance costs were reported in the balance sheet as an asset. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, however, we have elected to early adopt effective January 1, 2015. The election requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The ASU provides that debt issuance costs are similar to debt discounts and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing, thereby increasing the effective interest rate. As a result of the adoption, the September 30, 2014 Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet is restated as shown in Note 1 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.   30      Table of Contents   PART I.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 26, 2014; · Note 8 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to interest rate risk is incorporated herein by reference; and · Note 14 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to foreign currency exchange rate risk is incorporated herein by reference.   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2015 at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   Investigation by the U.S. Attorney. On November 8, 2013, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana approved the previously disclosed October 30, 2013 plea agreement between our wholly owned subsidiary, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co., and the United States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana (“DOJ”). The court’s approval of the plea agreement resolved the DOJ’s investigation into certain choke manifold testing irregularities that occurred in 2010 at one of Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co.’s offshore platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. We have been engaged in discussions with the Inspector General’s office of the Department of Interior regarding the same events that were the subject of the DOJ’s investigation. We can provide no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of these discussions and are unable to determine the amount of penalty, if any, that may be assessed. However, we presently believe that the outcome of our discussions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.   Venezuela Expropriation. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, C.A. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 23, 2011 against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PDVSA”) and PDVSA Petroleo, S.A. (“Petroleo”). We are seeking damages for the taking of our Venezuelan drilling business in violation of international law and for breach of contract. While there exists the possibility of realizing a recovery, we are currently unable to determine the timing or amounts we may receive, if any, or the likelihood of recovery.   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, which is significantly impacted by the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and other factors, including the recent decline in oil prices.   Our business depends on the conditions of the land and offshore oil and natural gas industry. Demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations regarding potential changes to these prices, significantly affect oil and natural gas industry activity.   Oil prices declined significantly during the second half of 2014 and have continued to decline in 2015. In response, many of our customers have announced significant reductions in their 2015 capital spending budgets. At March 31, 2015, 179 out of an available   31      Table of Contents   349 land rigs were working in the U.S. Land segment. After giving effect to new FlexRigs placed into service and additional rig releases since March 31, 2015, as of April 23, 2015, 165 rigs remain active in the U.S. Land segment excluding rigs that are in the process of stacking. We expect additional U.S. land rigs to become idle and spot market pricing softness to continue during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Given current oil pricing and existing market trends, the number of our contracted rigs in the U.S. may drop below 150 during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. In addition, low oil prices are expected to negatively impact drilling rigs in international locations and could affect offshore operations. In the event oil prices remain depressed for a sustained period, or decline further, we may experience further, significant declines in both drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Oil and natural gas prices are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including:   · the demand for oil and natural gas; · the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; · the worldwide economy; · expectations about future oil and natural gas prices; · domestic and international tax policies; · political and military conflicts in oil producing regions or other geographical areas or acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere; · technological advances; · the development and exploitation of alternative fuels; · local and international political, economic and weather conditions; · the ability of The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels and pricing; · the level of production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries; and · the environmental and other laws and governmental regulations regarding exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves.   The level of land and offshore exploration, development and production activity and the price for oil and natural gas is volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily translate into increased activity because demand for our services is typically driven by our customer’s expectations of future commodity prices. However, a sustained decline in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or prolonged low oil or natural gas prices would likely result in reduced exploration and development of land and offshore areas and a decline in the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   International uncertainties and local laws could adversely affect our business.   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of drilling rigs, equipment, land and other property, as well as expropriation of our customer’s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. In January 2015, the Venezuelan government announced plans for a new foreign currency exchange system. We are monitoring the status of this change in Venezuela’s exchange control policy. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas.   Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to us.   Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the six months ended March 31, 2015, approximately 11 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from international locations in our contract drilling business. During the six months ended March 31, 2015, approximately 69 percent of operating revenues from international locations were from operations in South America.   32      Table of Contents   Other risk factors.   Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to the Company’s securities portfolio and current backlog of contract drilling revenue in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2014. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first six months of fiscal 2015, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of Note 4 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof and Liquidity and Capital Resources — Backlog contained in Item 2 of Part I hereof.   Except as discussed above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2014.   33      Table of Contents   ITEM 6.
