Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 23, 2011, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2011 and September 30, 2011, and the percentage of the December 31, 2011 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2012:              Three Months Ended                         December 31,       September 30,       Percentage Not Reasonably         Reportable Segment       2011       2011       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2012                 (in billions)                 U.S. Land        $   3.7       $   3.3       72.8   %     Offshore        .1       .1       63.6   %     International Land        .4       .4       75.9   %             $   4.2       $   3.8                  Capital Resources   During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we announced agreements to build and operate 17 new FlexRigs under multi-year contracts. In January 2012, we announced agreements to build and operate an additional three new FlexRigs. During the three months ended December 31, 2011, we completed 11 FlexRigs that are under fixed term contracts. An additional four FlexRigs under fixed term contracts were completed by the end of January 2012. We currently expect to deliver a total of 45 new FlexRigs during fiscal 2012. Like those completed in prior fiscal periods, each of these new FlexRigs is committed to work for an exploration and production company under a fixed term contract, performing drilling services on a daywork contract basis.   Our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2012 is $1.1 billion but the actual spending level may vary depending primarily on the timing of procurement related to our ongoing construction of new FlexRigs. Capital expenditures were $256.9 million and $116.2 million for the first three months of fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Capital expenditures increased from 2011 primarily due to the additional new rigs completed during the comparable three month periods ended December 31.   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2011.   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   In December 2011, we extended our current lease for office space near downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma for an additional five years and added approximately 31,000 square feet. The extension and expansion increases the material commitments reported in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K by approximately $15.0 million.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Our accounting policies that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies.   22      Table of Contents   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   On October 1, 2011, we adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements requiring a reconciliation of purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of financial instruments valued with a Level 3 method, which is used to price the hardest to value instruments. The adoption had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   On May 12, 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. ASU No. 2011-04 is intended to create consistency between U.S. GAAP and IFRS on the definition of fair value and on the guidance on how to measure fair value and on what to disclose about fair value measurements. ASU No. 2011-04 will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption prohibited for public entities. We do not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   On June 16, 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU No. 2011-05 was issued to increase the prominence of OCI in financial statements. The guidance provides two options for presenting OCI. An OCI statement can be included with the net income statement, which together will make a statement of total comprehensive income. Alternatively, an OCI statement can be separate from a net income statement but the two statements will have to appear consecutively within a financial report. ASU No. 2011-05 will be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the method of presentation and the timing of adoption but the adoption will have no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   23      Table of Contents   PART I.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011, at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   There have been no material developments with respect to the information previously reported under Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011.   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   International uncertainties and local laws could adversely affect our business.   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of land and equipment as well as expropriation of a particular oil company’s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas.   Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to us.   Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the three months ended December 31, 2011, approximately 8 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During the three months ended December 31, 2011, approximately 74 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America.   New legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could delay or limit the drilling services we provide to customers whose drilling programs could be impacted by such laws.   Members of the U.S Congress and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, are reviewing more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, a technology which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. Both the U.S. Congress and the EPA are studying whether there is any link between hydraulic fracturing and soil or ground water contamination or any impact on public health. Legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. We do not engage in any hydraulic fracturing activities. However, any new laws, regulation or permitting requirements regarding hydraulic fracturing could delay or limit the drilling services we provide to customers whose drilling programs could be impacted by new legal requirements.   Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to interest rate risk and the Company’s securities portfolio in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2011. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first three months of fiscal 2012, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of, Notes 5 and 9 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof.   24      Table of Contents   Except as discussed above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2011.
