Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 21, 2012, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of March 31, 2013 and September 30, 2012, and the percentage of the March 31, 2013 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2013:              Three Months Ended                         March 31,       September 30,       Percentage Not Reasonably         Reportable Segment       2013       2012       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2013                 (in billions)                                                   U.S. Land        $   2.7       $   3.0       74.4   %     Offshore        .1       0.1       55.7   %     International Land        .5       0.5       76.4   %             $   3.3       $   3.6                  Capital Resources   Subsequent to the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we announced agreements to build and operate two new FlexRigs under multi-year contracts. Additionally, we announced an agreement to build a 3,000 horsepower AC drive rig which is scheduled to begin operations in our International Land segment in the spring of 2014. During the six months ended March 31, 2013, we completed 17 FlexRigs that are under fixed term contracts. An additional three FlexRigs under fixed term contracts were completed by the end of April 2013. One additional new FlexRig is under a fixed term contract but has not yet been completed. Like those completed in prior fiscal periods, each of these new FlexRigs is committed to work for an exploration and production company under a fixed term contract, performing drilling services on a daywork contract basis.   Our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2013 is now $850 million. However, the actual spending level may vary depending primarily on actual maintenance capital requirements and on the timing of procurement related to our ongoing construction of new rigs. Capital expenditures were $438.5 million and $492.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively.   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2012.   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   Material commitments as reported in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K has not changed significantly at March 31, 2013.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Our accounting policies that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   On October 1, 2012, we adopted ASU No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. ASU No. 2011-04 is intended to create consistency between U.S. GAAP and IFRS on the definition of fair value and on the guidance on how to measure fair value and on what to disclose about fair value measurements. The adoption of these provisions had no material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   On October 1, 2012, we adopted ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. ASU No. 2011-05 was issued to increase the prominence of OCI in financial statements. Our presentation of OCI is shown in a separate statement and was applied retrospectively. The adoption had no impact on the amount of OCI reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.   In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2013-2, Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU amends ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, and supersedes and replaces ASU 2011-05 Presentation of Comprehensive Income and ASU 2011-12 Comprehensive Income, to require reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to be presented either in the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements. The standard would not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, the guidance would require an entity to provide enhanced disclosures to present separately by component reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amendments in this ASU are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. We do not believe adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.   25      Table of Contents   PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION March 31, 2013   ITEM 3.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2013, at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   Pending Investigation by the U.S. Attorney. In May 2010, one of our employees reported certain possible choke manifold testing irregularities at one offshore platform rig. Operations were promptly suspended on that rig after receiving the employee’s report. The Minerals Management Service (now known as the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement) was promptly notified of the employee’s report and it conducted an initial investigation of this matter. Upon conclusion of the initial investigation, we were permitted to resume normal operations on the rig. Also, we promptly commenced an internal investigation of the employee’s allegations. Our internal investigation found that certain employees on the rig failed to follow our policies and procedures, which resulted in termination of those employees. There were no spills or discharges to the environment.   The U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana commenced a grand jury investigation, which is ongoing. We received, and have complied with, a subpoena for documents in connection with that investigation. Certain of our current and former employees have been interviewed by the government or have testified before the grand jury. In late April 2011, the Company was advised that it is a subject of this investigation.   Mr. Donald Hudson, former offshore platform rig manager, pleaded guilty in August of 2013 to one felony charge of making false statements to a federal investigator concerning his participation in the testing irregularities that were reported in May 2010. He was sentenced to two years probation and 120 hours community service. Mr. Hudson’s employment was terminated by the Company in June 2010. We continue to cooperate with this government investigation.   Although we presently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company, we can provide no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of this investigation.   Venezuela Expropriation. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, C.A. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 23, 2011 against Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“Petroleo”) and PDVSA Petroleo, S.A. (“PDVSA”). We are seeking damages for the taking of our Venezuelan drilling business in violation of international law and for breach of contract. Additionally, we are participating in one arbitration against a third party not affiliated with the Venezuelan government, Petroleo or PDVSA in an attempt to collect an aggregate $50 million relating to the seizure of our property in Venezuela. The arbitration hearing is presently scheduled for late May 2013. While there exists the possibility of realizing a recovery, we are currently unable to determine the timing or amounts we may receive, if any, or the likelihood of recovery.   26      Table of Contents   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   International uncertainties and local laws could adversely affect our business.   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of drilling rigs, equipment, land and other property, as well as expropriation of a particular oil company’s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas.   Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to us.   Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the six months ended March 31, 2013, approximately 11 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During the six months ended March 31, 2013, approximately 63 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America.   Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to the Company’s securities portfolio in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2012. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first six months of fiscal 2013, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of Note 4 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof.   Except as discussed above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2012.   27      Table of Contents   ITEM 6.
