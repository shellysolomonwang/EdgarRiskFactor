Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may continue to decline and may not be ultimately realized as fixed‑term contracts may in certain instances be terminated without an early termination payment,” of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, regarding fixed term contract risk.       Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017       Consolidated Results of Operations       Net Income We reported income from continuing operations of $8.4 million ($0.07 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $740.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared with income from continuing operations of $500.6 million ($4.55 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $564.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Included in net income for the three months ended December 31, 2018 is $10.6 million ($0.10 per diluted share) of income from discontinued operations. Including discontinued operations, we recorded net income of $19.0 million ($0.17 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to net income of $500.1 million ($4.55 per diluted share) for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Net income from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2018 includes approximately $4.3 million ($0.04 per diluted share) of after-tax gains from the sale of assets compared to $4.1 million ($0.04 per diluted share) during the three months ended December 31, 2017.        Selling, General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses increased to $54.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $46.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017. The $8.0 million increase in fiscal year 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to additions in employee count and compensation period over period and three full months of activity from MagVAR, acquired on December 8, 2017, which resulted in an increase in employee compensation, including taxes and benefits, compared to the same period in 2017.       Income Taxes We had income tax expense of $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 (which includes a discrete tax benefit of approximately $1.7 million related to the reversal of an uncertain tax liability, as the statute of limitation expired) compared to an income tax benefit of $500.6 million (which included a discrete tax benefit of approximately $500.4 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Reform Act) for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Our statutory federal income tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21.0% (before incremental state and foreign taxes).       Research and Development For the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred $7.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively, of research and development expenses. The increase in expense is primarily related to the acquisitions of MOTIVE and MagVAR given that a portion of their ongoing expenses are classified as research and development and additional new initiatives that are conducted through H&P Technologies.           41     Table of Contents     U.S. Land Operations Segment                                                                        Three Months Ended                               December 31,                      (in thousands, except operating statistics)         2018         2017         % Change      Operating revenues         $     624,241         $     461,640       35.2 				   %      Direct operating expenses               408,806               299,064       36.7 				          Selling, general and administrative expense               11,656               13,993       (16.7) 				          Depreciation               124,111               123,838       0.2 				          Segment operating income         $     79,668         $     24,745       222.0 				          Operating Statistics (1):                                                   Revenue days               21,933               18,362       19.4 				   %      Average rig revenue per day         $     25,265         $     22,400       12.8 				          Average rig expense per day         $     15,443         $     13,546       14.0 				          Average rig margin per day         $     9,822         $     8,854       10.9 				          Rig utilization               68    %           57    %   19.3 				               (1)    Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $70.1 million and $50.3 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.      Operating Income The U.S. Land segment had operating income of $79.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to operating income of $24.7 million in the same period of fiscal year 2018. Revenues were $624.2 million and $461.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in U.S. land revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2018 is early termination revenue of $2.4 million compared to $4.3 million during the same period of fiscal year 2018. Included in U.S. land operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2018 are costs of $18 million associated with a settled lawsuit.        Revenue Excluding early termination per day revenue of $109 and $233 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, average rig revenue per day increased by $2,989 to $25,156 as spot market pricing continues to improve. Compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017, our activity has increased primarily in response to higher commodity prices.        Direct Operating Expenses Average expense per day, excluding costs associated with a settled lawsuit of $821 per day for the three months ended December 31, 2018, increased $1,076 to $14,622 during the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher pass-through costs, including higher wages for field personnel in some regions and higher rig recommissioning expense during the three months ended December 31, 2018. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in average daily expenses for idle rig expenses.       Depreciation Excluding abandonments, depreciation increased $6.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. As the drilling markets continued to recover during 2017, we began abandoning older rig components that were replaced by upgrades to our rig fleet to meet customer demands for additional capabilities. This trend continued in fiscal year 2018. This resulted in abandonments of $0.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. In fiscal year 2019, depreciation expense also included $2.5 million of accelerated depreciation for components on rigs that are scheduled for conversion in fiscal year 2019.        Utilization U.S. land rig utilization increased to 68 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to 57 percent during the three months ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, 244 out of 350 existing rigs in the U.S. Land segment were contracted. Of the 244 contracted rigs, 156 were under fixed term contracts and 88 were working in the spot market.        42     Table of Contents     Offshore Operations Segment                                                                         Three Months Ended                               December 31,                     (in thousands, except operating statistics)         2018         2017         % Change      Operating revenues         $     36,910         $     33,366       10.6 				   %      Direct operating expenses               26,305               21,122       24.5 				          Selling, general and administrative expense               769               1,165       (34.0) 				          Depreciation               2,668               2,354       13.3 				          Segment operating income         $     7,168         $     8,725       (17.8) 				          Operating Statistics (1):                                                   Revenue days               525               460       14.1 				   %      Average rig revenue per day         $     35,635         $     35,776       (0.4) 				          Average rig expense per day         $     25,637         $     23,401       9.6 				          Average rig margin per day         $     9,998         $     12,375       (19.2) 				          Rig utilization               71    %           63    %   12.7 				               (1)    Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $5.8 million and $4.1 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The operating statistics only include rigs owned by us and exclude offshore platform management and labor service contracts and currency revaluation expense.      Operating Income During the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Offshore segment had operating income of $7.2 million compared to operating income of $8.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. This decrease is primarily attributable to favorable adjustments to self-insurance expenses that benefited the first fiscal quarter of 2018 along with a rate reduction that took place during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as a long-term contract expired. These negative effects were partially offset by activity and cash flow from an additional rig which commenced operations during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.       Revenue Average rig revenue per day remained relatively flat in the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017.        Direct Operating Expenses Average rig expense increased to $25,637 per day during the three months ended December 31, 2018 from $23,401 per day in the three months ended December 31, 2017. This per day increase was primarily attributable to one rig undergoing maintenance at a zero rate during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, as well as higher maintenance and supply expense for our other working rigs. The increase in absolute direct operating expenses was also driven by additional activity in the first fiscal quarter of 2019 as well as favorable adjustments to self-insurance expenses that benefited the first fiscal quarter of 2018.        Utilization During the first month of the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, a previously idle rig commenced work on a customer’s platform. As of December 31, 2018, six of our eight available platform rigs were contracted as compared to five of our eight available platform rigs at December 31, 2017.              43     Table of Contents     International Land Operations Segment                                                                        Three Months Ended                               December 31,                     (in thousands, except operating statistics)         2018         2017         % Change      Operating revenues         $     66,287         $     63,214       4.9 				   %      Direct operating expenses               47,539               46,737       1.7 				          Selling, general and administrative expense               2,281               1,132       101.5 				          Depreciation               9,837               11,811       (16.7) 				          Segment operating income         $     6,630         $     3,534       87.6 				          Operating Statistics (1):                                                   Revenue days               1,758               1,587       10.8 				   %      Average rig revenue per day         $     35,575         $     38,039       (6.5) 				          Average rig expense per day         $     22,704         $     26,688       (14.9) 				          Average rig margin per day         $     12,871         $     11,351       13.4 				          Rig utilization               60    %           45    %   33.3 				               (1)    Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $3.7 million and $2.9 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Operating Income The International Land segment had operating income of $6.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to operating income of $3.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.       Revenue Our activity has increased primarily in response to higher commodity prices. We experienced a 10.8 percent increase in revenue days when comparing the three months ended December 31, 2018 to the three months ended December 31, 2017. The average number of active rigs was 19.1 during fiscal year 2019 compared to 17.3 during fiscal year 2018.       Utilization Our utilization increased from 45 percent in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 to 60 percent in fiscal year 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the wind down of our operations in Ecuador, which reduced the number of available rigs by six.

The change was primarily driven by the acquisition of MagVAR in December 2017 and additional investment to expand our research and development capabilities.               44     Table of Contents     Other Operations       Results of our other operations, excluding corporate selling, general and administrative costs and corporate depreciation, are as follows:                                                                        Three Months Ended                               December 31,                     (in thousands)         2018         2017         % Change      Operating revenues         $     3,240         $     3,018       7.4 				   %      Direct operating expenses               1,274            1,167 				      9.2 				          Depreciation and amortization               412               353       16.7 				          Operating income         $     1,554         $     1,498       3.7 				             Operating Income Operating income from other operations remained relatively flat. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 other operations had operating income of $1.6 million compared to operating income of $1.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017.        Liquidity and Capital Resources       Sources of Liquidity       Our sources of available liquidity include existing cash balances on hand, cash flows from operations, and availability under our credit facility. Our liquidity requirements include meeting ongoing working capital needs, funding our capital expenditure projects, paying dividends declared, and repaying our outstanding indebtedness. Historically, we have financed operations primarily through internally generated cash flows. During periods when internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to meet liquidity needs, we will borrow from available credit sources, access capital markets or sell our portfolio securities. Likewise, if we are generating excess cash flows, we may invest in highly rated short‑term money market and debt securities. These investments can include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Agency issued debt securities, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and money market funds. The securities are recorded at fair value.   We may seek to access the debt and equity capital markets from time to time to raise additional capital, increase liquidity as necessary, fund our additional purchases, exchange or redeem Senior Notes, or repay any amounts under our credit facility. Our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, market and industry conditions and market perceptions of our industry, general economic conditions, our revenue backlog and our capital expenditure commitments.   Cash Flows       Our cash flows fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including, among others, the number of our drilling rigs under contract, the dayrates we receive under those contracts, the efficiency with which we operate our drilling units, the timing of collections on outstanding accounts receivable, the timing of payments to our vendors for operating costs, and capital expenditures. As our revenues increase, net working capital is typically a use of capital, while conversely, as our revenues decrease, net working capital is typically a source of capital. To date, general inflationary trends have not had a material effect on our operating margins.       As of December 31, 2018, we had $228.5 million of cash on hand and $41.1 million of short-term investments. Our cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented below:                                                         Three Months Ended                 December 31,       (in thousands)         2018         2017                               As adjusted      Net cash provided (used) by:                                    Operating activities         $     209,482         $     79,605      Investing activities               (186,730)               (128,844)      Financing activities               (86,347)               (82,582)      Decrease in cash and cash equivalents         $     (63,595)         $     (131,821)             45     Table of Contents     Operating Activities       Net working capital excluding cash and short-term investments were $387.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $412.6 million for the same period ended December 31, 2017. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $209.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 compared to approximately $79.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by increases in activity and rig margins coupled with a favorable variance in the use of working capital. Additionally, we recognized a $42.8 million loss as a result of the decline in value in our equity securities during the three months ended December 31, 2018. Furthermore, we recognized a deferred income tax benefit of $503.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017, which was a result of the Tax Reform Act.        Investing Activities       Capital Expenditures Our investing activities are primarily related to capital expenditures for our fleet. Our capital expenditures during the three months ended December 31, 2018 were $196.1 million compared to $91.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017. Based on current market conditions, we have adjusted our capital expenditures budget plan for fiscal year 2019 from a range of $650 million to $680 million to a range of $500 million to $530 million. This estimate includes moderated capital maintenance requirements, capital spending related to reactivating idle rigs, tubulars and other upgrades primarily related to improving our existing rig fleet.       Acquisition of Business During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we paid $2.8 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of AJC. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we paid $47.8 million, net of cash acquired, for MagVAR.       Sale of Assets Our proceeds from asset sales totaled $11.6 million during the first three months of fiscal year 2019 and $8.7 million during the first three months of fiscal year 2018. Income from asset sales during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 totaled $5.5 million and $5.6 million, respectively. In each period, we had sales of old or damaged rig equipment and drill pipe used in the ordinary course of business included in operating activity within the statement of cash flow.       Stock Portfolio Held We manage a legacy portfolio of marketable equity securities consisting of common shares of Ensco plc and Schlumberger, Ltd. that, at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, had a fair value of $39.7 million. The value of the portfolio is subject to fluctuation in the market and may vary considerably over time. The portfolio is recorded at fair value on our balance sheet.    Our stock portfolio held as of December 31, 2018 is presented below:                                                               Number                                    December 31, 2018         of Shares         Cost Basis         Market Value                (in thousands, except share amounts)      Ensco plc          6,400,000         $     34,760         $     22,784      Schlumberger, Ltd.          467,500               3,713               16,868      Total                   $     38,473         $     39,652         Financing Activities       We paid dividends of $0.71 and $0.70 per share during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total dividends paid were $78.1 million and $76.5 million during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Adjusting for stock splits accordingly, we have increased the effective annual dividend per share every fiscal year for the past 46 years. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.       Credit Facilities   On November 13, 2018, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2018 Credit Facility”), which will mature on November 13, 2023. The 2018 Credit Facility has $750 million in aggregate availability with a maximum of $75 million available for use as letters of credit. The 2018 Credit Facility also permits aggregate commitments under the facility to be increased by $300 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. The 2018 Credit Facility is currently guaranteed by Helmerich & Payne     46     Table of Contents  International Drilling Co. (“HPIDC”), which guarantee is subject to release following or simultaneously with HPIDC’s release as an obligor under the HPIDC 2025 Notes and the Company 2025 Notes. The borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility accrue interest at a spread over either the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or the Base Rate. We also pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of the facility. Borrowing spreads as well as commitment fees are determined based on the debt rating for senior unsecured debt of the Company or HPIDC as determined by Moody’s and S&P. The spread over LIBOR ranges from 0.875 percent to 1.500 percent per annum and commitment fees range from 0.075 percent to 0.200 percent per annum. Based on the unsecured debt rating of HPIDC on September 30, 2018, the spread over LIBOR would have been 1.125 percent and commitment fees would have been 0.125 percent had borrowings been outstanding under the facility. There is a financial covenant in the 2018 Credit Facility that requires us to maintain a total debt to total capitalization ratio of less than 50 percent. The 2018 Credit Facility contains additional terms, conditions, restrictions and covenants that we believe are usual and customary in unsecured debt arrangements for companies of similar size and credit quality, including a limitation that priority debt (as defined in the credit agreement) may not exceed 17.5 percent of the net worth of the Company. As of December 31, 2018, there were no borrowings, but there were three letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $38.0 million, and we had $712.0 million available to borrow under the 2018 Credit Facility. See Note 6-–Debt to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the 2018 Credit Facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, one letter of credit was reduced by $500,000, increasing the amount available under the 2018 Credit Facility by that amount.   In connection with entering into the 2018 Credit Facility, we terminated our $300 million unsecured credit facility under the credit agreement dated as of July 13, 2016 by and among HPIDC, as borrower, the Company, as guarantor, Wells Fargo, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto.    As of December 31, 2018, the Company has a $12 million unsecured standalone line of credit facility, which is purposed for the issuance of bid and performance bonds, as needed, for international land operations. There is nothing outstanding as of December 31, 2018.    The applicable agreements for all unsecured debt contain additional terms, conditions and restrictions that we believe are usual and customary in unsecured debt arrangements for companies that are similar in size and credit quality. At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and we anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance during the next quarter of fiscal year 2019.    Senior Notes   On November 19, 2018, we commenced an offer to exchange (the “Exchange Offer”) any and all outstanding HPIDC 2025 Notes for (i) up to $500.0 million aggregate principal amount the Company 2025 Notes, with registration rights, and (ii) cash. Concurrently with the Exchange Offer, we solicited consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) to adopt certain proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments”) to the indenture governing the HPIDC 2025 Notes, which include eliminating substantially all of the restrictive covenants in such indenture and limiting the reporting covenant under such indenture. On December 20, 2018, we settled the Exchange Offer, pursuant to which we issued approximately $487.1 million in aggregate principal amount of Company 2025 Notes. Interest on the Company 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2019. The terms of the Company 2025 Notes are governed by an indenture, dated December 20, 2018, as amended and supplemented by the first supplemental indenture thereto, dated December 20, 2018, each among the Company, HPIDC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. Following the consummation of the Exchange Offer, HPIDC had outstanding approximately $12.9 million in aggregate principal amount of HPIDC 2025 Notes. In connection with the Consent Solicitation, the requisite number of consents to adopt the Proposed Amendments was received. Accordingly, on December 20, 2018, HPIDC, the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, entered into a supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the HPIDC 2025 Notes to adopt the Proposed Amendments.       Future Cash Requirements       Our operating cash requirements, scheduled debt repayments, interest payments, any declared dividends, and estimated capital expenditures, including our rig upgrade construction program, for fiscal year 2019, are expected to be funded through current cash and cash to be provided from operating activities. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at current levels. If needed, we may decide to obtain additional funding from our $750 million revolving credit facility, which will mature on November 13, 2023. As mentioned in Note 6 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we had $712.0 million available to borrow under this revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2018. In addition, we have access as needed to the public debt markets as a result of the strength of our balance sheet and our investment grade credit ratings. Our indebtedness under our unsecured senior     47     Table of Contents  notes totaled $490.8 million at December 31, 2018; however, such debt does not mature until March 19, 2025. The long-term debt to total capitalization ratio was 10.2 percent at December 31, 2018 compared to 9.70 percent at December 31, 2017. For additional information regarding debt agreements, refer to Note 6 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2018.       Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.   Material Commitments       Material commitments as reported in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K have not changed significantly at December 31, 2018, other than those disclosed in Note 14 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.       Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       Our accounting policies and estimates that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management to make the most difficult judgments, are described in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
