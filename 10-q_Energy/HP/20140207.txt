Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2013 and September 30, 2013, and the percentage of the December 31, 2013 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2014:   22      Table of Contents              Three Months Ended                         December 31,       September 30,       Percentage Not Reasonably         Reportable Segment       2013       2013       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2014                 (in billions)                                                   U.S. Land        $   2.8       $   2.4       62.5   %     Offshore        0.1       0.1       64.4   %     International Land        0.4       0.4       59.4   %             $   3.3       $   2.9                  Capital Resources   Since September 30, 2013, we have announced that we had secured multi-year term contracts to build and operate 35 new FlexRigs with nine customers in the U.S. We expect our new FlexRig construction cadence to continue at a rate of approximately two per month through the end of the second fiscal quarter and to increase to approximately three per month beginning in April through the end of the fiscal year. During the three months ended December 31, 2013, we completed and placed into service seven new FlexRigs. Six additional new FlexRigs under fixed term contract were completed by the end of January 2014. In addition, we have an agreement to build a new 3,000 horsepower AC drive rig which is scheduled to begin operations in an international location in the spring of 2014. Like those completed in prior fiscal periods, each of the 35 new FlexRigs is committed to work for an exploration and production company under a fixed term contract, performing drilling services on a daywork contract basis.   Our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2014 has been increased to $950 million given the increasing demand for FlexRigs. However, the actual spending level may vary depending primarily on actual maintenance capital requirements and on the timing of procurement related to our ongoing newbuild efforts. Capital expenditures were $140.6 million and $219.4 million for the first three months of fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2013.   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   Material commitments as reported in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, has not changed significantly at December 31, 2013.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Our accounting policies that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   On October 1, 2013, we adopted ASU 2013-02, Other Comprehensive Income. ASU No. 2013-02 amended ASC 220, Comprehensive Income, and superseded and replaced ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, and ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income. The standard did not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. However, the guidance does require an entity to provide enhanced disclosures to present separately by component reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The adoption had no impact on the amount of OCI reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.   23      Table of Contents   PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION December 31, 2013   ITEM 3.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2013 at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   Investigation by the U.S. Attorney. On November 8, 2013, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana approved the previously disclosed October 30, 2013 plea agreement between our wholly owned subsidiary, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co., and the United States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana (“DOJ”). The court’s approval of the plea agreement resolved the DOJ’s investigation into certain choke manifold testing irregularities that occurred in 2010 at one of Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co.’s offshore platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. We are also currently engaged in discussions with the Inspector General’s office of the Department of Interior regarding the same events that were the subject of the DOJ’s investigation. Although we presently believe that the outcome of our discussions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company, we can provide no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of these discussions.   Venezuela Expropriation. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, C.A. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 23, 2011 against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PDVSA”) and PDVSA Petroleo, S.A. (“Petroleo”). We are seeking damages for the taking of our Venezuelan drilling business in violation of international law and for breach of contract.   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   International uncertainties and local laws could adversely affect our business.   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of drilling rigs, equipment, land and other property, as well as expropriation of a particular oil company’s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas.   Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements    24      Table of Contents   under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to us.   Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the three months ended December 31, 2013, approximately 11 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During the three months ended December 31, 2013, approximately 74 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America.   Other risk factors.   Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to the Company’s securities portfolio and current backlog of contract drilling revenue in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended September 30, 2013. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first three months of fiscal 2014, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of Note 4 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof and Liquidity and Capital Resources — Backlog contained in Item 2 of Part I hereof.   Except as discussed above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended September 30, 2013.   25      Table of Contents   ITEM 2.
