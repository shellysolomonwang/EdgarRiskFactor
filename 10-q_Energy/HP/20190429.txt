Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our current backlog of contract drilling revenue may continue to decline and may not be ultimately realized as fixed‑term contracts may in certain instances be terminated without an early termination payment,” of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), regarding fixed term contract risk.       Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018       Consolidated Results of Operations       Net Income We reported income from continuing operations of $71.9 million ($0.65 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $720.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to a loss from continuing operations of $1.6 million ($0.03 loss per diluted share) from operating revenues of $577.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Included in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is an $11.0 million ($0.10 per diluted share) loss from discontinued operations. Including discontinued operations, we recorded net income of $60.9 million ($0.55 per diluted share) for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to a net loss of $11.9 million ($0.12 loss per diluted share) for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Net income from continuing operations for the     47     Table of Contents  three months ended March 31, 2019 includes approximately $8.9 million ($0.08 per diluted share) of after-tax gains from the sale of assets compared to $3.9 million ($0.04 per diluted share) during the three months ended March 31, 2018.        Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $43.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $48.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The $4.7 million decrease in fiscal year 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to lower professional services expenses.        Income Taxes We had income tax expense of $25.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to an income tax benefit of $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Our statutory federal income tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21.0% (before incremental state and foreign taxes).       Research and Development For the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $7.3 million and $4.4 million, respectively, of research and development expenses. The increase in expense is primarily related to new initiatives that are conducted through H&P Technologies.       U.S. Land Operations Segment                                                                        Three Months Ended                               March 31,                      (in thousands, except operating statistics)         2019         2018         % Change      Operating revenues         $     622,204         $     482,729          28.9    %      Direct operating expenses               377,984               317,688          19.0           Selling, general and administrative expense               11,169               14,011          (20.3)           Depreciation               126,912               123,955          2.4           Segment operating income         $     106,139         $     27,075          292.0           Operating Statistics (1):                                                   Revenue days               21,262               18,666          13.9    %      Average rig revenue per day         $     25,681         $     22,928          12.0           Average rig expense per day         $     14,195         $     14,086          0.8           Average rig margin per day         $     11,486         $     8,842          29.9           Rig utilization               67    %           59    %      13.6                (1)    Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $76.2 million and $54.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.      Operating Income The U.S. Land segment had operating income of $106.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to operating income of $27.1 million in the same period of fiscal year 2018. Revenues were $622.2 million and $482.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in U.S. land revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 is early termination revenue of $1.2 million compared to $4.0 million during the same period of fiscal year 2018.        Revenue Excluding early termination per day revenue of $57 and $217 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, average rig revenue per day increased by $2,913 to $25,624 as dayrate pricing improved year-over-year. Compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018, our activity has increased as customer demand for super-spec rigs has continued to grow.        Direct Operating Expenses Average expense per day increased $109 to $14,195 during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to higher self-insurance expenses.       Depreciation Excluding abandonments, depreciation increased $5.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018. As the drilling markets continued to recover during 2017, we began abandoning older rig components that were replaced by upgrades to our rig fleet to meet customer demands for additional capabilities. This trend continued in fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. This resulted in abandonments of $4.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $7.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, depreciation expense also included $1.1 million of accelerated depreciation for components on rigs that are scheduled for conversion in fiscal year 2019.        Utilization U.S. land rig utilization increased to 67 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to 59 percent during the three months ended March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2019, 226 out of 350 existing rigs     48     Table of Contents  in the U.S. Land segment were contracted. Of the 226 contracted rigs, 142 were under fixed term contracts and 84 were working in the spot market.        Offshore Operations Segment                                                                         Three Months Ended                               March 31,                     (in thousands, except operating statistics)         2019         2018         % Change      Operating revenues         $     34,583         $     32,983       4.9 				   %      Direct operating expenses               26,984               23,595       14.4 				          Selling, general and administrative expense               805               1,106       (27.2) 				          Depreciation               2,263               2,833       (20.1) 				          Segment operating income         $     4,531         $     5,449       (16.8) 				          Operating Statistics (1):                                                   Revenue days               540               450       20.0 				   %      Average rig revenue per day         $     31,361         $     33,583       (6.6) 				          Average rig expense per day         $     25,941         $     24,079       7.7 				          Average rig margin per day         $     5,420         $     9,504       (43.0) 				          Rig utilization               75    %           63    %   19.0 				               (1)    Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $5.5 million and $5.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The operating statistics only include rigs owned by us and exclude offshore platform management and labor service contracts and currency revaluation expense.      Operating Income During the three months ended March 31, 2019, the Offshore segment had operating income of $4.5 million compared to operating income of $5.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily attributable to a rate reduction that took place during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 as a long-term contract expired and another active rig moving to a lower standby rate in December 2018. These negative effects were partially offset by activity and cash flow from an additional rig that commenced operations during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.       Revenue Average rig revenue per day declined in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to the factors mentioned above.        Direct Operating Expenses Average rig expense increased to $25,941 per day during the three months ended March 31, 2019 from $24,079 per day in the three months ended March 31, 2018. This per day increase was primarily attributable to one rig returning to work and having higher expenses per day than the average, partially offset by another rig having lower than average expenses.         Utilization As of March 31, 2019, six of our eight available platform rigs were generating revenue days as compared to five of our eight available platform rigs at March 31, 2018.       International Land Operations Segment                                                                        Three Months Ended                               March 31,                     (in thousands, except operating statistics)         2019         2018         % Change      Operating revenues         $     50,808         $     52,459          (3.1)    %      Direct operating expenses               33,051               39,249          (15.8)           Selling, general and administrative expense               794               832          (4.6)           Depreciation               8,995               13,073          (31.2)           Segment operating income (loss)         $     7,968         $     (695)          (1,246.5)           Operating Statistics (1):                                                   Revenue days               1,559               1,530          1.9    %      Average rig revenue per day         $     31,130         $     32,796          (5.1)           Average rig expense per day         $     19,269         $     24,263          (20.6)           Average rig margin per day         $     11,861         $     8,533          39.0           Rig utilization               54    %           45    %      20.0                (1)    Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $2.3 million during both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Also excluded are the effects of currency revaluation income and expense.          49     Table of Contents     Operating Income The International Land segment had operating income of $8.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.       Revenue We experienced a 1.9 percent increase in revenue days when comparing the three months ended March 31, 2019 to the three months ended March 31, 2018. The average number of active rigs was 17.3 during the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to 17.0 during the same period in fiscal year 2018.       Direct Operating Expenses Average rig expense decreased to $19,269 per day during the three months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $24,263 per day during the three months ended March 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which decreased our average daily expenses as a result of being translated from local currency to the U.S. dollar.        Utilization Our utilization increased from 45 percent in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 to 54 percent in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the wind down of our operations in Ecuador, which reduced the number of available rigs by six. At March 31, 2019, 17 out of 32 existing rigs in the International Land segment were contracted. Of the 17 contracted rigs, 11 were under fixed term contracts and 6 were working in the spot market.        H&P Technologies Operations Segment                                                                        Three Months Ended                               March 31,                     (in thousands)         2019         2018         % Change      Operating revenues         $     10,141         $     6,300       61.0 				   %      Direct operating expenses, including research and development               11,476            8,686 				      32.1 				          Selling, general and administrative expense               4,782               4,109       16.4 				          Depreciation and amortization               1,816               2,038       (10.9) 				          Segment operating loss         $     (7,933)         $     (8,533)       (7.0) 				             Operating Loss H&P Technologies had an operating loss of $7.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $8.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. The change was primarily driven by revenue growth, partially offset by additional research and development initiatives.        Other Operations       Results of our other operations, excluding corporate selling, general and administrative costs and corporate depreciation, are as follows:                                                                        Three Months Ended                               March 31,                     (in thousands)         2019         2018         % Change      Operating revenues         $     3,215         $     3,013       6.7 				   %      Direct operating expenses               1,619            1,137 				      42.4 				          Depreciation and amortization               431               358       20.4 				          Operating income         $     1,165         $     1,518       (23.3) 				             Operating Income Operating income from other operations remained relatively flat. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, other operations had operating income of $1.2 million compared to operating income of $1.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018.        Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 and 2018       Consolidated Results of Operations       Net Income We reported income from continuing operations of $80.2 million ($0.72 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $1.5 billion for the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to income from continuing operations of $499.0 million ($4.53 per diluted share) from operating revenues of $1.1 billion for the six months ended March 31, 2018. Included in net income for the six months ended March 31, 2019 is a loss from discontinued operations of $0.4 million (no impact per diluted share). Including discontinued operations, we recorded net income of $79.9 million ($0.72 per diluted share) for the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to net income of $488.2 million ($4.43 per     50     Table of Contents  diluted share) for the six months ended March 31, 2018. Net income from continuing operations for the six months ended March 31, 2019 includes approximately $13.2 million ($0.12 per diluted share) of after-tax gains from the sale of assets compared to $8.0 million ($0.07 per diluted share) during the six months ended March 31, 2018.        Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $98.0 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $94.7 million in the six months ended March 31, 2018. The $3.3 million increase in fiscal year 2019 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to higher variable compensation costs.       Income Taxes We had income tax expense of $26.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019 (which includes a discrete tax benefit of approximately $1.7 million related to the reversal of an uncertain tax liability, as the statute of limitation expired) compared to an income tax benefit of $504.6 million (which included a discrete tax benefit of approximately $501.8 million related to the remeasurement of the Company’s net deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”)) for the six months ended March 31, 2018. Our statutory federal income tax rate for fiscal year 2019 is 21.0% (before incremental state and foreign taxes).       Research and Development For the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $14.3 million and $7.7 million, respectively, of research and development expenses. The increase in expense is primarily related to new initiatives that are conducted through H&P Technologies. Additionally, the December 2017 acquisition of MagVAR drove some of the increase given that a portion of its ongoing expenses are classified as research and development.

Revenues were $1.2 billion and $944.4 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in U.S. land revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2019 is early termination revenue of $3.6 million compared to $8.3 million during the same period of fiscal year 2018. Included in U.S. land operating expenses for the six months ended March 31, 2019 are costs of $18 million associated with a settled lawsuit.        Revenue Excluding early termination per day revenue of $83 and $225 for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, average rig revenue per day increased by $2,947 to $25,388 as dayrate pricing improved year-over-year. Compared to the six months ended March 31, 2018, our activity has increased as customer demand for super-spec rigs has continued to grow.        Direct Operating Expenses Average expense per day, excluding costs associated with a settled lawsuit of $417 per day for the six months ended March 31, 2019, increased $594 to $14,412 during the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the six months ended March 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to higher pass-through costs, including higher wages for field personnel in some regions and higher rig recommissioning expense during the six months ended March 31, 2019. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in average daily expenses for idle rig expenses.       Depreciation Excluding abandonments, depreciation increased $12.5 million in the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the six months ended March 31, 2018. As the drilling markets continued to recover during 2017, we began abandoning older rig components that were replaced by upgrades to our rig fleet to meet customer demands for     51     Table of Contents  additional capabilities. This trend continued in fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. This resulted in abandonments of $5.0 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $14.3 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018. During the six months ended March 31, 2019, depreciation expense also included $3.6 million of accelerated depreciation for components on rigs that are scheduled for conversion in fiscal year 2019.        Utilization U.S. land rig utilization increased to 68 percent for the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to 58 percent during the six months ended March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2019, 226 out of 350 existing rigs in the U.S. Land segment were contracted. Of the 226 contracted rigs, 142 were under fixed term contracts and 84 were working in the spot market.        Offshore Operations Segment                                                                         Six Months Ended                               March 31,                     (in thousands, except operating statistics)         2019         2018         % Change      Operating revenues         $     71,493         $     66,349       7.8 				   %      Direct operating expenses               53,289               44,717       19.2 				          Selling, general and administrative expense               1,574               2,271       (30.7) 				          Depreciation               4,931               5,187       (4.9) 				          Segment operating income         $     11,699         $     14,174       (17.5) 				          Operating Statistics (1):                                                   Revenue days               1,065               910       17.0 				   %      Average rig revenue per day         $     33,468         $     34,692       (3.5) 				          Average rig expense per day         $     25,791         $     23,737       8.7 				          Average rig margin per day         $     7,677         $     10,955       (29.9) 				          Rig utilization               73    %           63    %   15.9 				               (1)    Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $11.3 million and $9.3 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The operating statistics only include rigs owned by us and exclude offshore platform management and labor service contracts and currency revaluation expense.      Operating Income During the six months ended March 31, 2019, the Offshore segment had operating income of $11.7 million compared to operating income of $14.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily attributable to a rate reduction that took place during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 as a long-term contract expired and another active rig moving to a lower standby rate in December 2018. These negative effects were partially offset by activity and cash flow from an additional rig that commenced operations during the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.       Revenue Average rig revenue per day remained relatively flat in the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the six months ended March 31, 2018.        Direct Operating Expenses Average rig expense increased to $25,791 per day during the six months ended March 31, 2019 from $23,737 per day in the six months ended March 31, 2018. This per day increase was primarily attributable to some of the factors mentioned above as well as one rig undergoing maintenance at a zero rate during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.        Utilization As of March 31, 2019, six of our eight available platform rigs were generating revenue days as compared to five of our eight available platform rigs at March 31, 2018.          52     Table of Contents     International Land Operations Segment                                                                        Six Months Ended                               March 31,                     (in thousands, except operating statistics)         2019         2018         % Change      Operating revenues         $     117,095         $     115,673          1.2    %      Direct operating expenses               80,590               85,986          (6.3)           Selling, general and administrative expense               3,076               1,964          56.6           Depreciation               18,832               24,884          (24.3)           Segment operating income         $     14,597         $     2,839          414.2           Operating Statistics (1):                                                   Revenue days               3,318               3,117          6.4    %      Average rig revenue per day         $     33,476         $     35,465          (5.6)           Average rig expense per day         $     21,083         $     25,497          (17.3)           Average rig margin per day         $     12,393         $     9,968          24.3           Rig utilization               57    %           45    %      26.7                (1)    Operating statistics for per day revenue, expense and margin do not include reimbursements of “out‑of‑pocket” expenses of $6.0 million and $5.1 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Also excluded are the effects of currency revaluation income and expense.      Operating Income The International Land segment had operating income of $14.6 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to operating income of $2.8 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018.       Revenue Our activity has increased primarily in response to higher commodity prices. We experienced a 6.4 percent increase in revenue days when comparing the six months ended March 31, 2019 to the six months ended March 31, 2018. The average number of active rigs was 18.2 during fiscal year 2019 compared to 17.1 during fiscal year 2018.       Direct Operating Expenses Average rig expense decreased to $21,083 per day during the six months ended March 31, 2019 as compared to $25,497 per day during the six months ended March 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which decreased our average daily expenses as a result of being translated from local currency to the U.S. dollar.       Utilization Our utilization increased from 45 percent in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 to 57 percent in fiscal year 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the wind down of our operations in Ecuador, which reduced the number of available rigs by six. At March 31, 2019, 17 out of 32 existing rigs in the International Land segment were contracted. Of the 17 contracted rigs, 11 were under fixed term contracts and 6 were working in the spot market.       H&P Technologies Operations Segment                                                                        Six Months Ended                               March 31,                     (in thousands)         2019         2018         % Change      Operating revenues         $     20,061         $     9,149       119.3 				   %      Direct operating expenses, including research and development               23,867            17,275 				      38.2 				          Selling, general and administrative expense               10,881               5,818       87.0 				          Depreciation and amortization               3,590               3,404       5.5 				          Segment operating loss         $     (18,277)         $     (17,348)       5.4 				             Operating Loss H&P Technologies had an operating loss of $18.3 million in the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $17.3 million in the six months ended March 31, 2018. The change was primarily driven by the acquisition of MagVAR in December 2018 as well as additional revenue growth. This was partially offset by additional research and development initiatives during fiscal year 2019.               53     Table of Contents     Other Operations       Results of our other operations, excluding corporate selling, general and administrative costs and corporate depreciation, are as follows:                                                                        Six Months Ended                               March 31,                     (in thousands)         2019         2018         % Change      Operating revenues         $     6,455         $     6,031       7.0 				   %      Direct operating expenses               2,893            2,304 				      25.6 				          Depreciation and amortization               843               711       18.6 				          Operating income         $     2,719         $     3,016       (9.8) 				             Operating Income Operating income from other operations remained relatively flat. During the six months ended March 31, 2019, other operations had operating income of $2.7 million compared to operating income of $3.0 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       Sources of Liquidity       Our sources of available liquidity include existing cash balances on hand, cash flows from operations, and availability under our credit facility. Our liquidity requirements include meeting ongoing working capital needs, funding our capital expenditure projects, paying dividends declared, and repaying our outstanding indebtedness. Historically, we have financed operations primarily through internally generated cash flows. During periods when internally generated cash flows are not sufficient to meet liquidity needs, we will borrow from available credit sources, access capital markets or sell our portfolio securities. Likewise, if we are generating excess cash flows, we may invest in highly rated short‑term money market and debt securities. These investments can include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Agency issued debt securities, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and money market funds. The securities are recorded at fair value.   We may seek to access the debt and equity capital markets from time to time to raise additional capital, increase liquidity as necessary, fund our additional purchases, exchange or redeem senior notes, or repay any amounts under our credit facility. Our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets depends on a number of factors, including our credit rating, market and industry conditions and market perceptions of our industry, general economic conditions, our revenue backlog and our capital expenditure commitments.   Cash Flows       Our cash flows fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including, among others, the number of our drilling rigs under contract, the dayrates we receive under those contracts, the efficiency with which we operate our drilling units, the timing of collections on outstanding accounts receivable, the timing of payments to our vendors for operating costs, and capital expenditures. As our revenues increase, net working capital is typically a use of capital, while conversely, as our revenues decrease, net working capital is typically a source of capital. To date, general inflationary trends have not had a material effect on our operating margins.       As of March 31, 2019, we had $243.9 million of cash on hand and $26.1 million of short-term investments. Our cash flows for the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 are presented below:                                                         Six Months Ended                 March 31,       (in thousands)         2019         2018                               As adjusted      Net cash provided (used) by:                                    Operating activities         $     409,018         $     207,651      Investing activities               (292,593)               (226,026)      Financing activities               (164,503)               (162,079)      Decrease in cash and cash equivalents         $     (48,078)         $     (180,454)             54     Table of Contents     Operating Activities       Net working capital excluding cash and short-term investments were $404.3 million as of March 31, 2019 compared to $412.6 million as of September 30, 2018. Cash flows from operating activities were approximately $409.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2019 compared to approximately $207.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increases in activity and rig margins coupled with a favorable variance in the use of working capital.        Investing Activities       Capital Expenditures Our investing activities are primarily related to capital expenditures for our fleet. Our capital expenditures during the six months ended March 31, 2019 were $330.0 million compared to $191.2 million during the six months ended March 31, 2018. Based on current market conditions, we have adjusted our initial capital expenditures budget plan for fiscal year 2019 from an initial range of $650 million to $680 million to a current range of $500 million to $530 million. This estimate includes moderated capital maintenance requirements, capital spending related to reactivating idle rigs, tubulars and other upgrades primarily related to improving our existing rig fleet.       Acquisition of Business During the six months ended March 31, 2019, we paid $2.8 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of AJC. During the six months ended March 31, 2018, we paid $47.9 million, net of cash acquired, for MagVAR.       Sale of Assets Our proceeds from asset sales totaled $24.6 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2019 and $17.8 million during the first six months of fiscal year 2018. Gains from asset sales during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $17.1 million and $10.8 million, respectively. In each period, we had sales of old or damaged rig equipment and drill pipe used in the ordinary course of business included in investing activity within the statement of cash flow.       Stock Portfolio Held We manage a legacy portfolio of marketable equity securities consisting of common shares of Ensco plc and Schlumberger, Ltd. that, at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, had a fair value of $45.5 million. The value of the portfolio is subject to fluctuation in the market and may vary considerably over time. The portfolio is recorded at fair value on our balance sheet.    Our stock portfolio held as of March 31, 2019 is presented below:                                                               Number                                    March 31, 2019         of Shares         Cost Basis         Market Value                (in thousands, except share amounts)      Ensco plc          6,400,000         $     34,760         $     25,152      Schlumberger, Ltd.          467,500               3,713               20,369      Total                   $     38,473         $     45,521         Financing Activities       We paid dividends of $1.42 and $1.40 per share during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Total dividends paid were $156.6 million and $153.4 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Adjusting for stock splits accordingly, we have increased the effective annual dividend per share every fiscal year for the past 46 years. The declaration and amount of future dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.       Credit Facilities   On November 13, 2018, we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2018 Credit Facility”), which will mature on November 13, 2023. The 2018 Credit Facility has $750 million in aggregate availability with a maximum of $75 million available for use as letters of credit. The 2018 Credit Facility also permits aggregate commitments under the facility to be increased by $300 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders. The 2018 Credit Facility is currently guaranteed by Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. (“HPIDC”), which guarantee is subject to release following or simultaneously with the repayment or exchange of the HPIDC 2025 Notes and HPIDC’s release as a guarantor under the Company 2025 Notes. The borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility accrue interest at a spread over either the London Interbank Offered Rate     55     Table of Contents  (LIBOR) or the Base Rate. We also pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of the facility. Borrowing spreads as well as commitment fees are determined based on the debt rating for senior unsecured debt of the Company or, in the event the Company has no such rating, the debt rating for senior unsecured debt of HPIDC, both as determined by Moody’s and S&P. The spread over LIBOR ranges from 0.875 percent to 1.500 percent per annum and commitment fees range from 0.075 percent to 0.200 percent per annum. Based on the unsecured debt rating of HPIDC on March 31, 2019, the spread over LIBOR would have been 1.125 percent had borrowings been outstanding under the facility and commitment fees are 0.125 percent. There is a financial covenant in the 2018 Credit Facility that requires us to maintain a total debt to total capitalization ratio of less than 50 percent. The 2018 Credit Facility contains additional terms, conditions, restrictions and covenants that we believe are usual and customary in unsecured debt arrangements for companies of similar size and credit quality, including a limitation that priority debt (as defined in the credit agreement) may not exceed 17.5 percent of the net worth of the Company. As of March 31, 2019, there were no borrowings, but there were two letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $12.1 million, leaving $737.9 million available to borrow under the 2018 Credit Facility. See Note 6-–Debt to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the 2018 Credit Facility. Subsequent to March 31, 2019, one of the letters of credit outstanding against the 2018 Credit Facility was eliminated, leaving one remaining letter of credit outstanding in the amount of $10 million, with $740 million available to borrow.   In connection with entering into the 2018 Credit Facility, we terminated our $300 million unsecured credit facility under the credit agreement dated as of July 13, 2016 by and among HPIDC, as borrower, the Company, as guarantor, Wells Fargo, National Association, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto.    As of March 31, 2019, we had an outstanding letter of credit with a bank under a bilateral line of credit in the amount of $25.5 million. Subsequent to March 31, 2019, a second bilateral credit facility was opened and a letter of credit was issued in the amount of $2.1 million.   As of March 31, 2019, we also had a $12.0 million unsecured standalone line of credit facility, which is purposed for the issuance of bid and performance bonds, as needed, for international land operations. Nothing was outstanding under the $12.0 million facility as of March 31, 2019.    The applicable agreements for all unsecured debt contain additional terms, conditions and restrictions that we believe are usual and customary in unsecured debt arrangements for companies that are similar in size and credit quality. At March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all debt covenants, and we anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance during the next quarter of fiscal year 2019.    Senior Notes   On November 19, 2018, we commenced the Exchange Offer for any and all outstanding HPIDC 2025 Notes for (i) up to $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company 2025 Notes, with registration rights, and (ii) cash. Concurrently with the Exchange Offer, we solicited consents (the “Consent Solicitation”) to adopt certain proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments”) to the indenture governing the HPIDC 2025 Notes, which include eliminating substantially all of the restrictive covenants in such indenture and limiting the reporting covenant under such indenture. On December 20, 2018, we settled the Exchange Offer, pursuant to which we issued approximately $487.1 million in aggregate principal amount of Company 2025 Notes. Interest on the Company 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing March 15, 2019. The terms of the Company 2025 Notes are governed by an indenture, dated December 20, 2018, as amended and supplemented by the first supplemental indenture thereto, dated December 20, 2018, each among the Company, HPIDC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. Following the consummation of the Exchange Offer, HPIDC had outstanding approximately $12.9 million in aggregate principal amount of HPIDC 2025 Notes. In connection with the Consent Solicitation, the requisite number of consents to adopt the Proposed Amendments was received. Accordingly, on December 20, 2018, HPIDC, the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, entered into a supplemental indenture to the indenture governing the HPIDC 2025 Notes to adopt the Proposed Amendments.       On February 15, 2019, we commenced the Registered Exchange Offer to exchange the Company 2025 Notes for new SEC-registered notes that are substantially identical to the terms of the Company 2025 Notes, except that the offer and issuance of the new notes have been registered under the Securities Act and certain transfer restrictions, registration rights and additional interest provisions relating to the Company 2025 Notes do not apply to the new notes. The Registered Exchange Offer expired on March 18, 2019, and approximately 99.99% of the Company 2025 Notes were exchanged. The Company 2025 Notes that were not exchanged pursuant to the Registered Exchange Offer have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States     56     Table of Contents  absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities law.       Future Cash Requirements       Our operating cash requirements, scheduled debt repayments, interest payments, any declared dividends, and estimated capital expenditures, including our rig upgrade construction program, for fiscal year 2019, are expected to be funded through current cash and cash to be provided from operating activities. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at current levels. If needed, we may decide to obtain additional funding from our $750 million 2018 Credit Facility. Our indebtedness under our unsecured senior notes totaled $491.2 million at March 31, 2019 and matures on March 19, 2025. The long-term debt to total capitalization ratio was 10.2 percent and 9.9 percent at March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For additional information regarding debt agreements, refer to Note 6 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2018.       Off-balance Sheet Arrangements   We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.   Material Commitments       Material commitments as reported in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K have not changed significantly at March 31, 2019, other than those disclosed in Note 14 to the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.       Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates       Our accounting policies and estimates that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management to make the most difficult judgments, are described in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies and estimates, with the exception of revenue recognition.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2019 at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.        There have been no material changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.       PART II. OTHER INFORMATION       Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       Venezuela Expropriation.        In 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, HPIDC and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, CA (“H&P de Venezuela”) filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (“Petroleo”), and PDVSA Petroleo, SA (“PDVSA”) under exceptions to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in response to Venezuela’s nationalization of H&P’s business.        Due to the ongoing political upheaval in Venezuela, the proceedings in the lawsuit are presently stayed. While there exists the possibility of realizing a recovery, we are currently unable to determine the timing or amounts we may receive, if any, or the likelihood of recovery. No contingent gains were recognized in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.       Item 1A. RISK FACTORS        There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A—“Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.          58     Table of Contents         ITEM 6.
