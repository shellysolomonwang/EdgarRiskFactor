Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 25, 2009, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2009 and September 30, 2009, and the percentage of the December 31, 2009 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2010:      Reportable       Total Backlog       Percentage Not Reasonably         Segment       12/31/2009       09/30/2009       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2010                 (in millions)                                                   U.S. Land       $   1,872       $   2,016       68.6   %     Offshore       158       169       79.8   %     International Land       319       343       73.0   %             $   2,349       $   2,528                  Capital Resources In December 2009, we announced we had increased our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2010 by $40 million to $265 million. Given improving market conditions, the capital expenditure increase provides adequate levels of FlexRig spare component availability and the flexibility to control and adapt our manufacturing effort to potentially build and complete additional FlexRigs at a rate of one per month beginning in May 2010 through the end of fiscal 2010. These potential new builds would be in addition to the new FlexRigs under fixed term contracts that we expect to complete by the end of April 2010. The increase in the capital expenditures estimate also allows us to execute selected special projects and increased maintenance levels. During the three months ended December 31, 2009, we completed four FlexRigs that are under fixed term contract with two of those beginning work during the quarter and two completed and ready for delivery. We have three remaining new FlexRigs under fixed term contract to complete by the end of April 2010. Like those completed in prior fiscal periods, each of these new FlexRigs are committed to work for an exploration and production company under a fixed term contract of at least three years in duration, performing drilling services on a daywork contract basis.   Capital expenditures were $64.8 million and $250.4 million for the first three months of fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased from 2009 primarily due to the reduction in the number of new rigs completed during the comparable quarters and a reduction in the number of rigs to be completed as of December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008.   28      Table of Contents   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2009.   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   Material commitments as reported in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K have not changed significantly at December 31, 2009.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Our accounting policies that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies other than the adoption of ASC 260-10-45, Earnings per Share, on October 1, 2009. The adoption of this did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The adoption of ASC 260-10-45 is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   ASC 715-20-65, Transition related to SFAS 132R-1, Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets, was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in December 2008. The new guidance requires employers of public and nonpublic companies to disclose more information about how investment allocation decisions are made, more information about major categories of plan assets, including concentration of risk and fair-value measurements, and the fair-value techniques and inputs used to measure plan assets. The disclosure requirements are effective for annual financial statements for years ending after December 15, 2009. The disclosure requirements will be adopted for our annual financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2010, on a prospective basis. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   On January 21, 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. Reporting entities will have to provide information about movements of assets among Levels 1 and 2 of the three-tier fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. Also required will be a reconciliation of purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of financial instruments valued with a Level 3 method, which is used to price the hardest to value instruments. Entities will have to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of financial assets and liabilities. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, the adoption will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   29      Table of Contents   PART I.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 25, 2009; · Note 7 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to interest rate risk are incorporated herein by reference; and · Note 3 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to credit risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk are incorporated herein by reference.   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2009, at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   30      Table of Contents   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of a particular oil company operator’s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas.   Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to us.   Venezuela continues to experience significant political, economic and social instability. In the event that extended labor strikes occur or turmoil increases, we could experience shortages in labor and/or materials and supplies necessary to operate some or all of our Venezuelan drilling rigs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   During the mid-1970s, the Venezuelan government nationalized the exploration and production business. More recently, Venezuela has nationalized some industries unrelated to the oilfield services industry. At the present time it appears the Venezuelan government will not nationalize the contract drilling business. Any such nationalization could result in the loss of all or a portion of our assets and business in Venezuela.   Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the three months ended December 31, 2009, approximately 15 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During the three months ended December 31, 2009, approximately 74 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America and approximately 66 percent of South American operating revenues were from Ecuador and Colombia.   Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to currency devaluation risk and receivable balances in Venezuela, interest rate risk and the Company’s securities portfolio in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2009. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first three months of fiscal 2010, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of, Notes 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof.   Except as discussed above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2009.   31      Table of Contents   ITEM 6.
