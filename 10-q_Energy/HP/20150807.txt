Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   37      Table of Contents   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, and the percentage of the June 30, 2015 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2015:              Three Months Ended                         June 30,       September 30,       Percentage Not Reasonably         Reportable Segment       2015       2014       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2015                 (in billions)                                                   U.S. Land       $   2.6       $   3.8       88.8   %     Offshore       0.1       0.1       90.2   %     International Land       0.8       1.1       91.7   %             $   3.5       $   5.0                  Capital Resources   Since September 30, 2014, we have announced that we had secured multi-year term contracts to build and operate six new FlexRigs with two customers in the U.S. During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, we completed 33 new FlexRigs. One additional new FlexRig under fixed-term contract was completed by July 30, 2015. Like those completed and placed into service in prior fiscal periods, each of the new FlexRigs is committed to work for an exploration and production company under a fixed-term contract, performing drilling services on a daywork contract basis.   Our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2015 is expected to total approximately $1.3 billion. However, the actual spending level may vary depending primarily on actual maintenance capital requirements and on the timing of procurement related to our ongoing newbuild efforts. We expect to complete 12 new FlexRigs between July 30, 2015 and the end of March 2016. All new FlexRigs scheduled for delivery during calendar 2015 and 2016 are supported with multi-year contracts. Capital expenditures were $971.9 million and $622.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2014.   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   In March 2015, we issued $500 million unsecured senior notes. The debt and estimated interest increases the material commitments reported in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K by approximately $732 million which has annual interest of approximately $23.2 million through March 2025.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   Our accounting policies and estimates that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than our self-insurance updated below, there have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies and estimates. The updated self-insurance accruals had no material impact to the consolidated condensed financial statements.   38      Table of Contents   Self-Insurance Accruals   We self-insure a significant portion of expected losses relating to worker’s compensation, general liability and automobile liability. Generally, deductibles range from $1 million to $3 million per occurrence depending on the coverage and whether a claim occurs outside or inside of the United States. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events. Estimates are recorded for incurred outstanding liabilities for worker’s compensation, general liability claims and claims that are incurred but not reported. Estimates are based on adjusters’ estimates, historic experience and statistical methods that we believe are reliable. Nonetheless, insurance estimates include certain assumptions and management judgments regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs.   With the exception of “named wind storm” risk in the Gulf of Mexico, we insure rig and related equipment at values that approximate the current replacement cost on the inception date of the policy. We self-insure a $5 million per occurrence rig property deductible through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. We have two insurance policies covering five offshore platform rigs for “named wind storm” risk in the Gulf of Mexico. The first policy covers four rigs and has a $75 million aggregate insurance limit over a $3 million deductible. The second policy covers one offshore platform rig and has a $30 million limit over a $3.5 million deductible. Two offshore platform rigs are insured by customers and two are in yards onshore and are insured with a $5 million deductible. We maintain certain other insurance coverage with deductibles as high as $5 million. Excess insurance is purchased over these coverage amounts to limit our exposure to catastrophic claims, but there can be no assurance that such coverage will respond or be adequate in all circumstances. Retained losses are estimated and accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and, using adjuster’s estimates, our historical loss experience or estimation methods that are believed to be reliable. Nonetheless, insurance estimates include certain assumptions and management judgments regarding the frequency and severity of claims, claim development and settlement practices. Unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense and related liabilities. We self-insure a number of other risks including loss of earnings and business interruption.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance. The new standard requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This update also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. The provisions of ASU 2014-09 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and we have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach when adopting this new standard. We are currently evaluating the alternative transition methods and the potential effects of the adoption of this update on our financial statements.   In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-03 “Interest — Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs”. ASU No. 2015-03 amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) to require that debt issuance cost be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related liability. Prior to the amendment, debt issuance costs were reported in the balance sheet as an asset. The amended guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, however, we have elected to early adopt effective January 1, 2015. The election requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. The ASU provides that debt issuance costs are similar to debt discounts and in effect reduce the proceeds of borrowing, thereby increasing the effective interest rate. As a result of the adoption, the September 30, 2014 Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet is restated as shown in Note 1 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.   39      Table of Contents   PART I.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2015 at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   Investigation by the U.S. Attorney. On November 8, 2013, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana approved the previously disclosed October 30, 2013 plea agreement between our wholly owned subsidiary, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co., and the United States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana (“DOJ”). The court’s approval of the plea agreement resolved the DOJ’s investigation into certain choke manifold testing irregularities that occurred in 2010 at one of Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co.’s offshore platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. We have been engaged in discussions with the Inspector General’s office of the Department of Interior regarding the same events that were the subject of the DOJ’s investigation. We can provide no assurances as to the timing or eventual outcome of these discussions and are unable to determine the amount of penalty, if any, that may be assessed. However, we presently believe that the outcome of our discussions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.   Venezuela Expropriation. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, C.A. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 23, 2011 against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PDVSA”) and PDVSA Petroleo, S.A. (“Petroleo”). We are seeking damages for the taking of our Venezuelan drilling business in violation of international law and for breach of contract. While there exists the possibility of realizing a recovery, we are currently unable to determine the timing or amounts we may receive, if any, or the likelihood of recovery.   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   Our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, which is significantly impacted by the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and other factors, including the recent decline in oil prices.   Our business depends on the conditions of the land and offshore oil and natural gas industry. Demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations regarding potential changes to these prices, significantly affect oil and natural gas industry activity.   40      Table of Contents   Oil prices declined significantly during the second half of 2014 and have continued to decline in 2015. In response, many of our customers have announced significant reductions in their 2015 capital spending budgets. At June 30, 2015, 153 out of an available 341 land rigs were working in the U.S. Land segment. After giving effect to new FlexRigs placed into service and additional rig releases since June 30, 2015, as of July 30, 2015, 156 rigs remain contracted in the U.S. Land segment. In the event oil prices remain depressed for a sustained period, or decline further, our U.S. Land, International Land and Offshore segments may experience further, significant declines in both drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   Oil and natural gas prices are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including:   · the demand for oil and natural gas; · the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas; · the worldwide economy; · expectations about future oil and natural gas prices; · domestic and international tax policies; · political and military conflicts in oil producing regions or other geographical areas or acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere; · technological advances; · the development and exploitation of alternative fuels; · local and international political, economic and weather conditions; · the ability of The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels and pricing; · the level of production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries; and · the environmental and other laws and governmental regulations regarding exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves.   The level of land and offshore exploration, development and production activity and the price for oil and natural gas is volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily translate into increased activity because demand for our services is typically driven by our customer’s expectations of future commodity prices. However, a sustained decline in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or prolonged low oil or natural gas prices would likely result in reduced exploration and development of land and offshore areas and a decline in the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   International uncertainties and local laws could adversely affect our business.   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of drilling rigs, equipment, land and other property, as well as expropriation of our customer’s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. In January 2015, the Venezuelan government announced plans for a new foreign currency exchange system. We are monitoring the status of this change in Venezuela’s exchange control policy. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas.   Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to us.   Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the nine months ended June 30, 2015, approximately 11.4 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from international locations in our contract drilling business. During the nine months ended June 30, 2015, approximately 71.5 percent of operating revenues from international locations were from operations in South America.   41      Table of Contents   Our offshore and land operations are subject to a number of operational risks, including environmental and weather risks, which could expose us to significant losses and damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us.   Our drilling operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the business, including inclement weather, blowouts, well fires, loss of well control, pollution, and reservoir damage. These hazards could cause significant environmental damage, personal injury and death, suspension of drilling operations, serious damage or destruction of equipment and property and substantial damage to producing formations and surrounding lands and waters.   Our Offshore drilling operations are also subject to potentially greater environmental liability, including pollution of offshore waters and related negative impact on wildlife and habitat, adverse sea conditions and platform damage or destruction due to collision with aircraft or marine vessels. Our Offshore operations may also be negatively affected by blowouts or uncontrolled release of oil by third parties whose offshore operations are unrelated to our operations. We operate several platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico experiences hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a frequent basis, the frequency of which may increase with any climate change. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could potentially curtail operations on such platform rigs for significant periods of time until the damage can be repaired. Moreover, even if our platform rigs are not directly damaged by such storms, we may experience disruptions in operations due to damage to customer platforms and other related facilities in the area.   We have a new-build rig assembly facility located near the Houston, Texas ship channel, and our principal fabricator and other vendors are also located in the gulf coast region. Due to their location, these facilities are exposed to potentially greater hurricane damage.   We have indemnification agreements with many of our customers and we also maintain liability and other forms of insurance. In general, our drilling contracts contain provisions requiring our customers to indemnify us for, among other things, pollution and reservoir damage. However, our contractual rights to indemnification may be unenforceable or limited due to negligent or willful acts by us, our subcontractors and/or suppliers. Our customers may also dispute, or be unable to meet, their contractual indemnification obligations to us. Accordingly, we may be unable to transfer these risks to our drilling customers by contract or indemnification agreements. Incurring a liability for which we are not fully indemnified or insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   With the exception of “named wind storm” risk in the Gulf of Mexico, we insure rigs and related equipment at values that approximate the current replacement cost on the inception date of the policies. However, we self-insure large deductibles under these policies. We also carry insurance with varying deductibles and coverage limits with respect to offshore platform rigs and “named wind storm” risk in the Gulf of Mexico.   We have insurance coverage for comprehensive general liability, automobile liability, worker’s compensation and employer’s liability, and certain other specific risks. Insurance is purchased over deductibles to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events. We retain a significant portion of our expected losses under our worker’s compensation, general liability and automobile liability programs. The Company self-insures a number of other risks including loss of earnings and business interruption. We are unable to obtain significant amounts of insurance to cover risks of underground reservoir damage.   If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or an enforceable or recoverable indemnity from a customer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our insurance will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations. Our coverage includes aggregate policy limits. As a result, we retain the risk for any loss in excess of these limits. No assurance can be given that all or a portion of our coverage will not be cancelled during fiscal 2015, that insurance coverage will continue to be available at rates considered reasonable or that our coverage will respond to a specific loss. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from our insurers or our insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage.   Other risk factors   Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to the Company’s securities portfolio and current backlog of contract drilling revenue in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2014. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first nine months of fiscal 2015, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of Note 4 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof and Liquidity and Capital Resources — Backlog contained in Item 2 of Part I hereof.   Except as discussed above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2014.   42      Table of Contents   ITEM 6.
