Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 24, 2010, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, and the percentage of the December 31, 2010 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2011:              Three Months Ended                         December 31,       September 30,       Percentage Not Reasonably         Reportable Segment       2010       2010       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2011                 (in millions)                                                   U.S. Land        $   2,168       $   1,999       64.7   %     Offshore        131       139       75.6   %     International Land        292       311       77.4   %             $   2,591       $   2,449                  Capital Resources   During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we announced agreements to build and operate four new FlexRigs under multi-year contracts. In January 2011, we announced agreements to build and operate an additional eight new FlexRigs. During the three months ended December 31, 2010, we completed seven FlexRigs that are under fixed term contracts. An additional three FlexRigs under fixed term contracts were completed by the end of January 2011. Like those completed in prior fiscal periods, each of these new FlexRigs are committed to work for an exploration and production company under a fixed term contract, performing drilling services on a daywork contract basis.   Given the increased number of customer commitments that we have for new FlexRigs to be completed this year, and the level of rig component orders that are required to ensure our ability to effectively respond to additional new FlexRig demand, our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2011 has increased from $600 million, as previously disclosed, to approximately $750 million. Capital expenditures were $116.2 million and $64.8 million for the first three months of fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Capital expenditures increased from 2010 primarily due to the additional new rigs completed during the comparable quarters.   There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2010.   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   Material commitments as reported in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K have not changed significantly at December 31, 2010.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   Our accounting policies that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations and that require management to make the most difficult judgments are described in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   On January 21, 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. Effective December 15, 2009, we adopted the disclosure requirements requiring reporting entities to provide information about movements of assets among Levels 1 and 2 of the three-tier fair value hierarchy    23      Table of Contents   established by ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. The adoption had no impact on these Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, a reconciliation of purchases, sales, issuance, and settlements of financial instruments valued with a Level 3 method, which is used to price the hardest to value instruments, will be required. We currently believe the adoption related to Level 3 financial instruments will have no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   On October 1, 2010, we adopted ASU No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements — a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (Topic 605), which amended the revenue guidance under ASC 605. The adoption had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   24      Table of Contents   PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION December 31, 2010   ITEM 3.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 24, 2010; · Note 9 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to interest rate risk is incorporated herein by reference; and · Note 15 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to foreign currency exchange rate risk is incorporated herein by reference.   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2010, at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   International operations are subject to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of terrorism, kidnapping of employees, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of a particular oil company operator’s property and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, currency rate fluctuations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. There can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas.   Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms acceptable to us.   Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the three months ended December 31, 2010, approximately 12 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During the three months ended December 31, 2010, approximately 64 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America and approximately 73 percent of South American operating revenues were from Argentina and Colombia.   Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to currency devaluation, interest rate risk and the Company’s securities portfolio in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2010. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first three months of fiscal 2011, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of, Notes 5, 9 and 15 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof.   Except as discussed above, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2010.   25      Table of Contents   ITEM 6.
