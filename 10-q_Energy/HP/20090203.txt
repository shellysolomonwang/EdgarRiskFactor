Item 1A. Risk Factors” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 26, 2008, regarding fixed term contract risk, operational risks, including weather, and vendors that are limited in number and thinly capitalized.   The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of February 1, 2009 and October 31, 2008, and the percentage of the February 1, 2009 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2009:      Reportable       Total Backlog       Percentage Not Reasonably         Segment       02/01/2009       10/31/2008       Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2009                 (in billions)                                                   U.S. Land       $   2.566       $   2.876       71.6%         Offshore       .180       .199       83.1%         International Land       .288       .299       82.2%                 $   3.034       $   3.374                  Capital Resources   During the three months ended December 31, 2008, the Company announced commitments to build 13 new FlexRigs for locations in the United States. These 13 contracts have term durations ranging from three to four years. These 13, along with the 127 rigs announced in fiscal years 2005 through 2008 brings the Company’s commitments to a total of 140 new FlexRigs. Eight of these 140 new rigs were contracted for work in International Land operations and the remaining 132 in U.S. Land operations. The drilling services are performed on a daywork contract basis. Through the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2009, 111 rigs were completed for delivery, and 104 of the 111 had begun field operations. The remaining rigs are expected to be completed by the end of calendar 2009.   26      Table of Contents   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS December 31, 2008   Capital expenditures were $250.4 million and $149.8 million for the first three months of fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures increased from 2008 primarily due to the Company’s current construction program of new FlexRigs.   The Company has revised the capital expenditure estimate to approximately $850 million for fiscal 2009, including construction of new FlexRigs.   There were no other significant changes in the Company’s financial position since September 30, 2008.   MATERIAL COMMITMENTS   Material commitments as reported in the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K have not changed significantly at December 31, 2008.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES   The Company’s accounting policies that are “critical” or the most important to understand the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and that require management of the Company to make the most difficult judgments are described in the Company’s 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies other than the adoption of SFAS No. 157, SFAS No. 159, and EITF 06-11 on October 1, 2008. The adoption of these did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The additional disclosures required by SFAS No. 157 are included in Note 6, Fair Value Measurements.   RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   In November 2008, the FASB ratified EITF, Issue No. 08-6 “Equity-Method Investment Accounting.” EITF 08-6 concludes that the cost basis of a new equity-method investment would be determined using a cost-accumulation mode, which would continue the practice of including transaction costs in the cost of investment and would exclude the value of contingent consideration. Equity-method investment should be subject to other-than-temporary impairment analysis. It also requires that a gain or loss be recognized on the portion of the investor’s ownership sold. EITF 08-6 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of EITF 08-6 may have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   In June 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities, to clarify that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, are participating securities. An entity must include participating securities in its calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method pursuant to SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating FSP EITF 03-6-1 to determine the impact, if any, on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 142-3, Determining the Useful Life of Intangible Assets (FSP SFAS 142-3). FSP SFAS 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS 142. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years. This FSP must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. Accordingly, the Company will adopt FSP SFAS 142-3 in fiscal year 2010.   27      Table of Contents   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS December 31, 2008   In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (the FSP). The FSP amends SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, to delay the effective date of SFAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (that is, at least annually). For items within its scope, the FSP defers the effective date of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the FSP to determine the impact, if any, on the Consolidated Financial Statements.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations and SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51. Both of these standards are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141(R) will be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring after the effective date. Earlier application is prohibited. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting SFAS No. 160 but does not expect its adoption to have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statement.   In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Companies are not allowed to adopt SFAS No. 159 on a retrospective basis unless they choose early adoption. The Company adopted SFAS No. 159 on October 1, 2008, and did not elect the fair value option for eligible items that existed at the date of adoption.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value, sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurements, and requires new disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSPs No. 157-1 and No. 157-2, which, respectively, removed leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157 and deferred for one year the effective date for SFAS No. 157 as it applies to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities. On October 1, 2008, the Company adopted, on a prospective basis, the SFAS No. 157 definition of fair value and became subject to the new disclosure requirements (excluding FSP 157-2) with respect to our fair value measurements of (a) nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in our financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and (b) all financial assets and liabilities. The adoption did not impact the consolidated financial position or results of operations. The additional disclosures required by SFAS No. 157 are included in Note 6, Fair Value Measurements.   The deferral provided by FSP No. 157-2 applies to such items as nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination (but not measured at fair value in subsequent periods) and nonfinancial long-lived asset groups measured at fair value for an impairment assessment. The Company is currently evaluating the impact FSP No. 157-2 will have on nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, which are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.   On October 1, 2008, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards (“EITF 06-11”). EITF 06-11 requires companies to recognize a realized income tax benefit associated with dividends or dividend equivalents paid on nonvested equity-classified employee share-based payment awards that are charged to retained earnings as an increase to additional paid-in capital. The adoption of EITF 06-11 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.   28      Table of Contents   PART I.
