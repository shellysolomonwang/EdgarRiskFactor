Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, regarding fixed term contract risk.       Capital Resources       During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, we completed one new FlexRig. The new FlexRig is working for an exploration and production company under a fixed-term contract, performing drilling services on a daywork contract basis. During fiscal 2017, we have been upgrading existing rigs to meet customer demands for additional capabilities.       Our capital spending estimate for fiscal 2017 is now estimated to be approximately $400 million, and potentially higher depending on the timing of expenditures related to upgrading opportunities. This increase from our prior estimate of $350 million is due to more rigs being upgraded than initially anticipated and higher levels of maintenance capital expenditures as a result of more rigs working than previously estimated. The revised estimate excludes the acquisition of MOTIVE Drilling Technologies, Inc. Capital expenditures were $300.3 million and $219.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.       There were no other significant changes in our financial position since September 30, 2016.       MATERIAL COMMITMENTS       Material commitments as reported in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K have not changed significantly at June 30, 2017.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       Our accounting policies and estimates that are critical or the most important to understand our financial condition and results of operations, and that require management to make the most difficult judgments, are described in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting policies and estimates.       RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS       In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance. Throughout 2016 and in early 2017, additional accounting guidance was issued to clarify the not yet effective revenue recognition guidance issued in May 2014. The ASU provides for full retrospective, modified retrospective, or use of the cumulative effect method during the period of adoption. During 2017, we established an implementation team and began a detailed analysis of our contracts in place during the     45     Table of Contents  retrospective period. We anticipate we will have two primary revenue streams consisting of lease and service components. The requirements in this ASU are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We expect to adopt this new revenue guidance utilizing the modified retrospective method of adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. As we are still evaluating certain aspects of our contract drilling revenue, we are unable to quantify the impact that the new revenue standard will have on our consolidated financial statements at this time.       In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements — Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The guidance provides principles and definitions for management that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures provided in footnotes. Under the standard, management is required to evaluate for each annual and interim reporting period whether it is probable that the entity will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that financial statements are issued (or are available to be issued, where applicable). The standard is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.       In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This update simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory. It replaces the current lower of cost or market test with the lower of cost or net realizable value test. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new standard should be applied prospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial consolidated statements.       In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments — Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The standard requires entities to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The provisions of ASU No. 2016-01 are effective for interim and annual periods starting after December 15, 2017. At adoption, a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings will be recorded. We will adopt this standard on October 1, 2018. Subsequent to adoption, changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale investments will be recognized in net income and the effect will be subject to stock market fluctuations.       In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU No. 2016-02 will require organizations that lease assets — referred to as “lessees” — to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. Under ASU No. 2016-02, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current GAAP. In addition, disclosures of leasing activities are to be expanded to include qualitative along with specific quantitative information. For public entities, ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. ASU No. 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method. We expect to adopt this new lease guidance utilizing the modified retrospective method of adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 concurrently with ASU 2014-09. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.       In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU No. 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.       In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses. The ASU sets forth a “current expected credit loss” (CECL) model which requires companies to measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on     46     Table of Contents  financial assets measured at amortized cost and applies to some off-balance sheet credit exposures. This standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.       In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). The ASU is intended to reduce diversity in practice in presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments by providing guidance on eight specific cash flow issues. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted, including adoption during an interim period. We are currently assessing the impact this standard will have on our consolidated statement of cash flows.       In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash. The ASU requires amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the total beginning and ending amounts for the periods shown on the statement of cash flows. We will adopt the guidance beginning October 1, 2018 applied retrospectively to all periods presented. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or cash flows.       In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. ASU 2017-07 will change how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other post-retirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. Employers will present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item(s) as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period. Employers will present the other components of the net periodic benefit cost separately from the line item(s) that includes the service cost and outside of any subtotal of operating income, if one is presented. This standard is effective for public business entities for annual periods or any interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operation.       In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The objective of this ASU is to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Step 2 measures a goodwill impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Instead, under this ASU, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The ASU is applicable for public entities for their annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We early adopted this guidance effective June 30, 2017 with no impact on our consolidated financial statements. Goodwill will be evaluated for impairment each year in our fourth fiscal quarter.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       For a description of our market risks, see     ·    Note 5 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to equity price risk which is incorporated herein by reference;    ·    “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 23, 2016;    ·    Note 9 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to interest rate risk which is incorporated herein by reference;    ·    Note 15 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof with regard to foreign currency exchange rate risk which is incorporated herein by reference; and      47     Table of Contents       ·    Risk Factors in Item 1A of Part II hereof with regard to commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk which is incorporated herein by reference.      ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES       As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2017 at ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.       PART II. OTHER INFORMATION       ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS       Investigation by the U.S. Attorney. On November 8, 2013, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana approved the previously disclosed October 30, 2013 plea agreement between our wholly owned subsidiary, Helmerich & Payne International Drilling Co. (“HPIDC”), and the United States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana (“DOJ”). The court’s approval of the plea agreement resolved the DOJ’s investigation into certain choke manifold testing irregularities that occurred in 2010 at one of HPIDC’s offshore platform rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. We also engaged in discussions with the Inspector General’s office of the Department of the Interior (“DOI”) regarding the same events that were the subject of the DOJ’s investigation. Although we do not presently anticipate any further action by the DOI in this matter, we can provide no assurance as to the timing or eventual outcome of the DOI’s consideration of the matter.       Venezuela Expropriation. Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, HPIDC and Helmerich & Payne de Venezuela, C.A. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on September 23, 2011 against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. and PDVSA Petroleo, S.A. We are seeking damages for the taking of our Venezuelan drilling business in violation of international law and for breach of contract. While there exists the possibility of realizing a recovery, we are currently unable to determine the timing or amounts we may receive, if any, or the likelihood of recovery.       ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS       Our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, which is significantly impacted by the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and other factors.       Our business depends on the conditions of the land and offshore oil and natural gas industry. Demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations regarding potential changes to these prices, significantly affect oil and natural gas industry activity.       In June 2014, oil prices reached over $106 per barrel and then began to decline significantly during the second half of 2014 and continued to decline in 2015 closing below $40 per barrel by December 31, 2015. During early 2016, oil prices dropped below $30 per barrel and many of our customers announced significant reductions in their 2016 capital spending budgets. The severe decline in oil prices led to a significant decline in our active rig fleet. For example, at March 31, 2015, 179 out of an available 332 land rigs were contracted in the U.S. Land segment. In contrast, at June 30, 2016, 89 out of an available 348 land rigs were contracted in the U.S. Land segment. However, during the second half of 2016, oil prices increased (but remained below $55 per barrel), the U.S. land active rig count increased and our customers began increasing their drilling budgets. Due to the gradual rebound in oil prices in calendar 2016 as noted     48     Table of Contents  above, we had 190 out of an available 350 land rigs contracted in the U.S. Land segment at June 30, 2017. At July 27, 2017, 189 rigs were contracted in the U.S. Land segment. In the event oil prices drop again and remain depressed for a sustained period, our U.S. Land, International Land and Offshore segments may again experience significant declines in both drilling activity and spot dayrate pricing which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.       Oil and natural gas prices are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including:         ·    the demand for oil and natural gas;    ·    the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;    ·    the worldwide economy;    ·    expectations about future oil and natural gas prices;    ·    the desire and ability of The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;    ·    the level of production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries;    ·    the continued development of shale plays which may influence worldwide supply and prices;    ·    domestic and international tax policies;    ·    political and military conflicts in oil producing regions or other geographical areas or acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere;    ·    technological advances;    ·    the development and exploitation of alternative fuels;    ·    legal and other limitations or restrictions on exportation and/or importation of oil and natural gas;    ·    local and international political, economic and weather conditions; and    ·    the environmental and other laws and governmental regulations regarding exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves.      The level of land and offshore exploration, development and production activity and the price for oil and natural gas is volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily translate into increased activity because demand for our services is typically driven by our customer’s expectations of future commodity prices. However, a sustained decline in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas or prolonged low oil or natural gas prices would likely result in reduced exploration and development of land and offshore areas and a decline in the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.       We are subject to the political, economic and social instability risks and local laws associated with doing business in certain foreign countries.       We currently have operations in South America and the Middle East. In the future, we may further expand the geographic reach of our operations. As a result, we are exposed to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social unrest, strikes, terrorism, war, kidnapping of employees, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contract provisions, expropriation of equipment as well as expropriation of oil and gas exploration and drilling rights, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and industry in the markets in which we operate, economic and financial instability of national oil companies, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted.       South American countries, in particular, have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability. From time to time these risks have impacted our business. For example, on June 30, 2010, the Venezuelan government expropriated 11 rigs and associated real and personal property owned by our Venezuelan subsidiary. Prior thereto, we also experienced currency devaluation losses in Venezuela and difficulty repatriating U.S. dollars to the United States. Today, our contracts for work in foreign countries generally provide for payment in U.S. dollars. However, in Argentina we are paid in Argentine pesos. The     49     Table of Contents  Argentine branch of one of our second-tier subsidiaries then remits U.S. dollars to its U.S. parent by converting the Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars through the Argentine Foreign Exchange Market and repatriating the U.S. dollars.    Estimates from published sources indicate that Argentina is a highly inflationary country, which is defined as cumulative inflation rates exceeding 100 percent in the most recent three-year period based on inflation data published by the respective governments. Regardless, all of our foreign operations use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency and local currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars with gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions included in current results of operations.       In December 2015, the Argentine peso experienced a sharp devaluation resulting in an aggregate foreign currency loss of $9.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2016. Subsequent to the sharp devaluation, the Argentine peso significantly stabilized and the Argentine Foreign Exchange Market controls now places fewer restrictions on repatriating U.S. dollars. For the nine months ended June 30, 2017, we experienced aggregate foreign currency losses of $3.3 million. However, in the future, other contracts or applicable law may require payments to be made in foreign currencies. As such, there can be no assurance that we will not experience in Argentina or elsewhere a devaluation of foreign currency, foreign exchange restrictions or other difficulties repatriating U.S. dollars even if we are able to negotiate contract provisions designed to mitigate such risks. In the event of future payments in foreign currencies and an inability to timely exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars, we may incur currency devaluation losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.       Additionally, there can be no assurance that there will not be changes in local laws, regulations and administrative requirements or the interpretation thereof which could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations or on our ability to continue operations in certain areas. Because of the impact of local laws, our future operations in certain areas may be conducted through entities in which local citizens own interests and through entities (including joint ventures) in which we hold only a minority interest or pursuant to arrangements under which we conduct operations under contract to local entities. While we believe that neither operating through such entities nor pursuant to such arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our operations or revenues, there can be no assurance that we will in all cases be able to structure or restructure our operations to conform to local law (or the administration thereof) on terms we find acceptable.       Although we attempt to minimize the potential impact of such risks by operating in more than one geographical area, during the nine months ended June 30, 2017, approximately 12.4 percent of our consolidated operating revenues were generated from the international contract drilling business. During the nine months ended June 30, 2017, approximately 90.0 percent of the international operating revenues were from operations in South America. Substantially all of the South American operating revenues were from Argentina and Colombia. The future occurrence of one or more international events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.       Other risk factors       Reference is made to the risk factors pertaining to the Company’s securities portfolio and current backlog of contract drilling revenue in Item 1A of Part 1 of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2016. In order to update these risk factors for developments that have occurred during the first nine months of fiscal 2017, the risk factors are hereby amended and updated by reference to, and incorporation herein of Note 5 to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of Part I hereof (regarding our securities portfolio) and Liquidity and Capital Resources — Backlog contained in Item 2 of Part I hereof.       Except as discussed above for the nine months ended June 30, 2017, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K.              50     Table of Contents         ITEM 6.
