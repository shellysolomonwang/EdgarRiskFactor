Item 1A. Risk Factors.There have been no material changes in the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A in our 2013 Form10-K. Below are additional risk factors related to the recent announcement of our proposed merger transactions.Risks Relating to the Merger TransactionsThe mergers that are part of the Merger Transactions are contingent upon each other, are subject to other substantial conditions and may not be consummated even if the required KMI stockholder, KMP unitholder, KMR shareholder and EPB unitholder approvals are obtained.Completion of each merger is contingent upon completion of the other two mergers. No merger will occur unless all three mergers occur. Each merger agreement contains other conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, would result in the applicable merger not occurring, even though the KMI stockholders and the KMP unitholders, KMR shareholders or EPB unitholders, as applicable, may have voted in favor of the merger-related proposals presented to them. Satisfaction of some of the conditions to the mergers, such as receipt of required regulatory approvals, is not entirely in the control of the parties to the merger agreements. In addition, we and the other parties to each merger agreement can agree not to consummate the merger even if allstockholder and unitholder or shareholder approvals have been received. The closing conditions to a merger may not be satisfied, and we or the other parties to the applicable merger agreement may choose not to, or may be unable to, waive an unsatisfied condition, which may cause such merger not to occur.KMI is subject to provisions that limit its ability to pursue alternatives to the KMP Merger and the KMR Merger, could discourage a potential competing acquirer of KMI from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances under the KMP or KMR Merger Agreements, could require KMI to pay a termination fee to KMP or KMR.Under the KMP Merger Agreement and the KMR Merger Agreement, KMI is restricted from entering into alternative transactions. Unless and until the merger agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, KMI is restricted from soliciting, initiating, knowingly facilitating, knowingly encouraging or knowingly inducing or negotiating, any inquiry, proposal or offer for a competing acquisition proposal with any person. Under the KMP and KMR Merger Agreements, in the event of a potential change by the KMI board of its recommendation with respect to the charter amendment proposal or the stock issuance proposal in light of a superior proposal or intervening event, KMI must provide KMP and KMR, as the case may be, with five days’ notice to allow KMP and KMR to propose an adjustment to the terms and conditions of its merger agreement. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of KMI from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in specified circumstances.We are subject to provisions under the KMP and KMR Merger Agreements that, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay a termination fee to KMP or KMR, as applicable.Under the KMP Merger Agreement and the KMR Merger Agreements we may be required to pay to KMP or KMR, as applicable, a termination fee if such merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, such as certain changes by our board of directors in its recommendation to stockholders regarding the charter amendment proposal and the stock issuance proposal. If such a termination fee is payable, the payment of this fee could have material and adverse consequences to our financial condition and operations.67Table of Contents Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-QWe and the other parties will incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger Transactions.We and the other parties to the Merger Transactions expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Merger Transactions, which are currently estimated to total approximately $90 million, excluding expenses associated with expected financings, which expenses could be substantial. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain costs due to the fact that KMP, KMR and EPB will no longer be public companies will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time. Thus, any net cost savings may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all.Failure to complete, or significant delays in completing, the Merger Transactions could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results.Completion of the Merger Transactions is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the merger by the KMP, KMR and EPB unitholders or shareholders or by governmental agencies is not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied. If the Merger Transactions are not completed, or if there are significant delays in completing the Merger Transactions, the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results could be negatively affected, and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:•the parties may be liable for damages to one another under the terms and conditions of the merger agreements;•negative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the prices of our common stock, KMP common units, KMR shares or EPB common units due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the Merger Transactions will be completed;•having to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger Transactions, including, in certain circumstances, a termination fee to KMP and/or KMR; and •the attention of management of KMI, KMP, KMR and EPB will have been diverted to the Merger Transactions rather than KMI’s KMP’s, KMR’s and EPB’s own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to it.Our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.In connection with the Merger Transactions, we expect to incur approximately $4.2 billion of indebtedness either under the bridge facility or in capital markets transactions. As a result, as of June 30, 2014, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Merger Transactions, we would have had approximately $39.3 billion of consolidated debt (excluding debt fair value adjustments). If we borrow under the bridge facility, it will increase our exposure to floating rate debt. Additionally, in connection with the Merger Transactions, we, KMP, EPB and substantially all of our respective wholly owned subsidiaries with debt will enter into a cross guarantee arrangement whereby each entity will unconditionally guarantee the indebtedness of each other entity, thereby causing us to become liable for the debt of each of such subsidiaries. This level of debt and this cross guarantee arrangement could have important consequences, such as:•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or potential growth or for other purposes;•increasing the cost of our future borrowings;•limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business or to pay dividends because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make payments on our debt;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt; and•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.Our ability to service our debt will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which will be beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our indebtedness, including the cross-guaranteed 68Table of Contents Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-Qdebt, and any future indebtedness that we may incur, we will be forced to take actions, which may include reducing dividends, reducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all. To the extent indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger Transactions is floating rate debt, such as would be the case pursuant to the bridge facility, each of KMI’s, KMP’s, KMR’s and EPB’s exposure to floating rate debt would increase.Purported class action complaints have been filed challenging the merger transactions, and an unfavorable judgment or ruling in these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the proposed merger and result in substantial costs.Two purported class action lawsuits are currently pending that challenge the merger transactions. Each lawsuit names as defendants KMP, KMI, KMGP, and individual members of KMGP’s board of directors. Additionally, KMR, P Merger Sub LLC, E Merger Sub LLC, EPB, EPGP, and individual members of EPGP’s board of directors are named as defendants in one of the pending actions. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs seek to enjoin one or more of the proposed merger transactions. If these lawsuits are not dismissed or otherwise resolved, they could prevent and/or delay completion of the merger transactions and result in substantial costs to KMI, KMP, KMR, and EPB including any costs associated with the indemnification of general partners, directors, and/or their affiliates. Additional lawsuits may be filed in connection with the proposed merger transactions. There can be no assurance that any of the defendants will prevail in the pending litigation or in any future litigation. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim may adversely affect the combined organization’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Item 2.
