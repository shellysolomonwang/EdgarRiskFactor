Item 1A. Risk Factors.   There have been no material changes in or additions to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our 2010 Form 10-K. There are, however, risks associated with the proposed acquisition of El Paso. Several of the more significant risks are identified below.   We and El Paso may be unable to obtain the regulatory clearances and approvals required to complete the merger or, in order to do so, we and El Paso may be required to comply with material restrictions or conditions.       The merger is subject to regulatory review by governmental agencies having jurisdiction, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The closing of the merger is also subject to the condition that there be no law, injunction, judgment or ruling by a governmental authority in effect seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent or prohibit the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. We can provide no assurance that all required regulatory approvals will be obtained. Further, we have agreed to avoid or eliminate any impediment to the merger that may be asserted by governmental entities under the antitrust laws, including diverting assets, terminating relationships or committing to limit our future freedom of action. If we must take such actions, it could be detrimental to us or to the combined company after the effective time of the merger. Additionally, even if the parties receive early termination of the statutory waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act or the waiting period thereunder expires, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest at any time, including after completion of the merger. In addition, in some jurisdictions, a competitor, customer or other third party could initiate a private action under such jurisdiction’s antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the merger, before or after it is completed. We may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.   If our financing for the merger becomes unavailable, the merger may not be completed and we may be in breach of the merger agreement.    We intend to finance the cash component of the merger consideration with debt financing. On October 16, 2011, we entered into a financing commitment letter with Barclays Capital, which commitment has subsequently been syndicated with a group of banks. Pursuant to the commitment letter, Barclays Capital has committed to provide a $6.8 billion senior secured 364-day bridge term loan facility and a $5.0 billion senior secured three-year term loan facility to fund the cash consideration in the merger. The commitment is subject to various conditions, including the absence of a material adverse effect on El Paso having occurred, our receipt of credit ratings from S&P and Moody’s, the execution of satisfactory documentation and other customary closing conditions. In the event that the financing contemplated by the commitment letter is not available, other financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. If other financing becomes necessary and we are unable to secure such other financing, we could be in breach of the merger agreement assuming all other conditions to closing are satisfied, may be obligated to pay damages to El Paso or may be compelled to specifically perform our obligations to consummate the transactions.    We and El Paso may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the merger.   Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on El Paso employees and our employees may have an adverse effect on El Paso and us and consequently the combined company. This uncertainty may impair the respective company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel until the merger is completed. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles with the combined company. If employees of El Paso or our employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become employees of the combined company, the combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could be reduced.   Failure to complete the merger could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results.   Completion of the merger is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the transaction by the stockholders of El Paso or by governmental agencies is not obtained or that other closing conditions are not satisfied. If the merger is not completed, it could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results, and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:           •   having to pay certain significant costs relating to the merger;              •   negative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the price of our common stock due to the fact            83         Kinder Morgan, Inc. Form 10-Q                    that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed; and                   •      the attention of our management will have been diverted to the merger rather than our own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us.
