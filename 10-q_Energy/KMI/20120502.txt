Item 1A. Risk Factors.   Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in or additions to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our 2011 Form 10-K.   The terms upon which we will sell the assets comprising KMP’s FTC Natural Gas Pipelines disposal group are uncertain.   As a condition to receiving antitrust approval from the FTC of our planned acquisition of EP, we have agreed to divest the assets comprising KMP’s FTC Natural Gas Pipelines disposal group. As a result of this agreement, we reduced the disposal group’s net asset carrying value to its estimated fair value and recognized a $428 million loss on the remeasurement to fair value. However, the terms upon which we will sell these assets are subject to negotiation and agreement with an as-yet undetermined third party. As a result, our estimate of the fair value of the disposal group’s net assets may not reflect the price at which we ultimately agree to sell them.   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
