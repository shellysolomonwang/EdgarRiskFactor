Item 1(a). Risk Factors The statements in this section describe the known material risks to our business and should be considered carefully. The risk factor below updates the respective risk factor previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2017, there have been no other material changes in risk factors previously disclosed.Our business in Venezuela subjects us to actions by the Venezuelan government, the risk of delayed payments, and currency risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. We believe there are risks associated with our operations in Venezuela, which continues to experience significant political and economic turmoil, including the possibility that the Venezuelan government could assume control over our operations and assets. The political and economic conditions have deteriorated further in 2017, leading to uncertainty in the future business climate, the state of security, and governance of the country. This environment increases the risk of civil unrest, armed conflicts, adverse actions by the government of Venezuela, or imposition of sanctions or other actions by the U.S. and foreign governments that may restrict our ability to continue operations or realize the value of our assets. On July 26, 2017, the U.S. Government announced sanctions on 13 Venezuelan individuals, including a current employee of our primary customer in Venezuela. This development could delay or prevent our ability to execute the promissory note exchange discussed further in Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. While sanctions have not been imposed against our primary customer, there can be no assurance that such sanctions, or other sanctions affecting our business in Venezuela, will not be imposed in the future. Any such sanctions may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate in Venezuela.We have continued to experience delays in collecting payments on our receivables from our primary customer in Venezuela. If conditions continue to worsen in the country and we experience further delays or failure in receiving payment on these receivables, including any default on our current and expected promissory notes, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. The future results of our Venezuelan operations will be affected by many factors, including the foreign currency exchange rate, actions of the Venezuelan government, and general economic conditions such as continued inflation and future customer payments and spending.
