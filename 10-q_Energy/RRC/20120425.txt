Item 1A. Risk Factors as filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 as filed with the SEC on February 22, 2012.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil company primarily engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian and Southwestern regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. Unless otherwise indicated, the information included herein relates to our continuing operations.  Our objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and crude oil and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Our corporate headquarters is located in Fort Worth, Texas.  Market Conditions  Prices for various quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices for commodities are inherently volatile. The following table lists average NYMEX prices for natural gas and oil for first quarter 2012 and 2011.                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2012     2011     Average NYMEX prices (a)             Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 2.77     $ 4.12     Oil (per bbl)   $ 103.13     $ 94.67        (a)   Based on average of bid week prompt month prices.    23    Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview of First Quarter 2012 Results  During first quarter 2012, we achieved the following financial and operating results:        •    achieved 52% production growth (excluding our Barnett Shale properties);        •    continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale by growing production, proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage;        •    reduced direct operating expenses per mcfe by 33%;        •    reduced our DD&A rate 9%;        •    maintained a strong balance sheet by issuing $600.0 million of new 10-year senior subordinated notes and achieved a debt to capitalization ratio of 49% at March 31, 2012;        •    entered into additional derivative contracts for 2012, 2013 and 2014; and        •    realized $156.0 million of cash flow from operating activities.  Total revenues increased $34.2 million or 16% in first quarter 2012 over the same period of 2011. This increase was due to higher production offset by lower realized prices and an increase in mark-to-market loss from derivatives. Our first quarter 2012 production growth was due to the continued success of our drilling program, particularly in the Marcellus Shale. We believe natural gas, NGLs and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new technology and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for 2012, 2013 and 2014, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future.  Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales include netback arrangements where we sell natural gas and oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. We record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. Revenues also include arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at a specific delivery point and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation deduction. Third party transportation costs we incur to get our commodity to the delivery point are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense. Hedges included in natural gas, NGLs and oil sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Cash settlements of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in derivative fair value loss in the accompanying statements of operations. In first quarter 2012, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 26% from 2011 with a 52% increase in production partially offset by a 17% decrease in realized prices. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):                            Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2012     2011     Change     %           Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                             Gas wellhead   $ 128,068     $ 130,795     $ (2,727 )      (2 %)    Gas hedges realized     57,629       29,616       28,013       95 %                                         Total gas revenue   $ 185,697     $ 160,411     $ 25,286       16 %                                               Total NGLs revenue   $ 76,498     $ 55,045     $ 21,453       39 %                                         Total oil revenue   $ 55,422     $ 36,507     $ 18,915       52 %                                               Combined wellhead   $ 259,988     $ 222,347     $ 37,641       17 %    Combined hedges     57,629       29,616       28,013       95 %                                         Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales   $ 317,617     $ 251,963     $ 65,654       26 %                                          24    Table of Contents Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production offset by the natural decline of our natural gas and oil wells and asset sales. For first quarter 2012, our production volumes increased 68% in our Appalachian region and increased 11% in our Southwestern region. Our production for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 is set forth in the following table:                            Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2012     2011     Change     %           Production (a)                       Natural gas (mcf)     46,633,207       29,805,523       16,827,684       56 %    NGLs (bbls)     1,560,826       1,131,565       429,261       38 %    Crude oil (bbls)     608,077       436,132       171,945       39 %    Total (mcfe) (b)     59,646,625       39,211,706       20,434,919       52 %          Average daily production (a)                       Natural gas (mcf)     512,453       331,172       181,281       55 %    NGLs (bbls)     17,152       12,573       4,579       36 %    Crude oil (bbls)     6,682       4,846       1,836       38 %    Total (mcfe) (b)     655,457       435,686       219,771       50 %       (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.    (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.  Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received during first quarter 2012 was $4.51 per mcfe compared to $5.75 per mcfe in the same period of 2011. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualify for hedge accounting. Average sales prices (wellhead) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying statements of operations. Average sales prices (wellhead) do include transportation costs where we receive net proceeds. Average realized price calculations for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 are shown below:                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2012     2011     Average Prices             Average sales prices (wellhead):             Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 2.75     $ 4.39     NGLs (per bbl)     49.01       48.65     Crude oil (per bbl)     91.14       83.71     Total (per mcfe) (a)     4.36       5.67         Average realized prices (including derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting):             Natural gas (per mcf)     3.98       5.38     NGLs (per bbl)     49.01       48.65     Crude oil (per bbl)     91.14       83.71     Total (per mcfe) (a)     5.32       6.43         Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range):             Natural gas (per mcf)     3.18       4.58     NGLs (per bbl)     44.71       48.14     Crude oil (per bbl)     83.54       79.31     Total (per mcfe) (a)     4.51       5.75        (a)  Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.    25    Table of Contents Derivative fair value loss was $60.8 million in first quarter 2012 compared to a loss of $40.8 million in the same period of 2011. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Mark-to-market accounting treatment results in volatility of our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Any gains on our derivatives will be offset by lower wellhead revenues in the future or any losses will be offset by higher future wellhead revenues based on the value at the settlement date. The increase in the mark-to-market loss in the first quarter 2012 is primarily due to higher oil and NGL prices. Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in derivative fair value loss, is associated with contracts that qualify for hedge accounting. The ineffective portion is calculated as the difference between the change in the fair value of the derivative and the estimated change in future cash flows from the item being hedged.  The following table presents information about the components of derivative fair value loss for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2012     2011         Change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting (a)   $ (52,056 )    $ (40,036 )    Realized gain (loss) on settlements – natural gas (b) (c)     —        (394 )    Realized gain (loss) on settlements – oil (b) (c)     (4,622 )      (1,918 )    Realized gain (loss) on settlements – NGLs (b) (c)     (4,392 )      —      Hedge ineffectiveness – realized (c)     1,185       946      – unrealized (a)     (948 )      568                           Derivative fair value loss   $ (60,833 )    $ (40,834 )                             (a)   These amounts are unrealized and are not included in average realized price calculations.    (b)   These amounts represent realized gains and losses on settled derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.    (c)   These settlements are included in average realized price calculations (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range).  (Loss) gain on the sale of assets was a loss of $10.4 million in first quarter 2012 compared to a gain of $139,000 in the same period of 2011. In the first quarter 2012, we sold a seventy five percent interest in an East Texas prospect which included a suspended exploratory well and unproved properties for proceeds of $8.5 million resulting in a pre-tax loss of $10.3 million.  Other revenue in first quarter 2012 was a gain of $535,000 compared to a gain of $1.4 million in the same period of 2011. The 2012 period includes income from equity method investments of $316,000. The 2011 period includes income from equity method investments of $262,000, proceeds of $629,000 from a lawsuit settlement and $312,000 of transportation and gathering revenue.  We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. Production and ad valorem tax expense includes the Pennsylvania impact fee of $0.50 per mcfe of which $0.40 per mcfe is a retroactive adjustment for wells drilled prior to 2012.

We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties. On an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for 2012 increased 1% due to an increase in the number of producing wells and higher workover costs offset by lower water hauling and disposal costs. We incurred $1.5 million of workover costs in first quarter 2012 compared to $390,000 of workover costs in the same period of 2011.  On a per mcfe basis, operating expense in first quarter 2012 decreased to $0.49 or 33% from the same period of 2011, with the decrease consisting of lower water hauling and disposal costs and well services somewhat offset by higher workover costs. We expect to continue to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and SARs as part of the compensation of field employees. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011:                            Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2012     2011     Change     %Change           Lease operating expense   $ 0.45     $ 0.71     $ (0.26 )      (37 %)    Workovers     0.03       0.01       0.02       200 %    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.01       0.01       —        —                                           Total direct operating expenses   $ 0.49     $ 0.73     $ (0.24 )      (33 %)                                        Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This category also includes the new Pennsylvania impact fee. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $6.4 million in first quarter 2012 compared to $6.9 million in the same period 2011. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) decreased to $0.11 in first quarter 2012 compared to $0.18 in the same period of 2011 due to lower prices and an increase in volumes not subject to severance taxes. In February 2012, the commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” on unconventional natural gas and oil production which includes the Marcellus Shale. First quarter 2012 includes a $24.0 million retroactive impact fee ($0.40 per mcfe) which covers all unconventional wells drilled by Range prior to 2012 which is to be paid to the commonwealth in September 2012. Also included in first quarter 2012 is a $6.2 million impact fee ($0.10 per mcfe) accrual for wells drilled by Range prior to 2012 plus wells drilled in first quarter 2012 to be paid in April 2013.  General and administrative expense was $38.7 million in first quarter 2012 compared to $34.0 million for the same period of 2011. The 2012 increase of $4.7 million when compared to 2011 is due to higher salaries and benefits ($2.9 million), an increase in stock-based compensation of $628,000, higher bad debt expense ($688,000) and higher office expenses including information technology somewhat offset by an insurance recovery. We continue to incur higher wages which we consider necessary to remain competitive in the industry. Our personnel costs continue to increase as we invest in our technical teams and other staffing to support our expansion into our various shale plays. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and SARs granted to our employees and directors as part of compensation. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the first three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011:                            Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2012     2011     Change     %Change           General and administrative   $ 0.51     $ 0.68     $ (0.17 )      (25 %)    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.14       0.19       (0.05 )      (26 %)                                         Total general and administrative expenses   $ 0.65     $ 0.87     $ (0.22 )      (25 %)                                          27    Table of Contents Interest expense was $37.2 million for first quarter 2012 compared to $24.8 million for the same period of 2011.

In March 2012, we issued $600.0 million of 5.0% senior subordinated notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay $350.0 million of our outstanding credit facility balance and for general corporate purposes. In May 2011, we issued $500.0 million of 5.75% senior subordinated notes due 2021. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes and to purchase or redeem $150.0 million of our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and $250.0 million of our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016. The 2012 and 2011 note issuances were undertaken to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for 2012 was $253.2 million compared to $421.1 million for 2011 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.1% in 2012 compared to 2.3% in 2011.  Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) was $100.2 million in first quarter 2012 compared to $72.2 million in the same period of 2011. The increase in 2012 when compared to 2011 is due to a 7% decrease in depletion rates more than offset by a 52% increase in production.  On a per mcfe basis, DD&A decreased to $1.68 in first quarter 2012 compared to $1.84 in the same period of 2011. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $1.59 per mcfe in first quarter 2012 compared to $1.71 per mcfe in the same period of 2011. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for first quarter 2012 and 2011:                            Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2012     2011     Change     %Change           Depletion and amortization   $ 1.59     $ 1.71     $ (0.12 )      (7 %)    Depreciation     0.06       0.10       (0.04 )      (40 %)    Accretion and other     0.03       0.03       —        —                                           Total DD&A expense   $ 1.68     $ 1.84     $ (0.16 )      (9 %)                                        Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, transportation, gathering and compression, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties and deferred compensation plan expenses. In first quarter 2012, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($357,000), exploration expense ($928,000) and general and administrative expense ($8.2 million) for a total of $9.9 million. In first quarter 2011, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($310,000), exploration expense ($1.3 million) and general and administrative expense ($7.5 million) for a total of $9.6 million. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants and SARs grants.  Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $40.8 million in first quarter 2012 compared to $25.1 million in the same period of 2011. These third party costs are higher due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering and compression agreements. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range).    28    Table of Contents Exploration expense was $21.5 million in first quarter 2012 compared to $27.2 million in the same period of 2011. Exploration expense was lower in first quarter 2012 when compared to 2011 due to lower seismic, delay rentals and personnel costs. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):                            Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2012     2011     Change     %Change           Seismic   $ 10,672     $ 13,172     $ (2,500 )      (19 %)    Delay rentals and other     5,703       8,650       (2,947 )      (34 %)    Personnel expense     3,504       4,026       (522 )      (13 %)    Stock-based compensation expense     928       1,329       (401 )      (30 %)    Dry hole expense     709       10       699       6,990 %                                         Total exploration expense   $ 21,516     $ 27,187     $ (5,671 )      (21 %)                                        Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $20.3 million in first quarter 2012 compared to $16.5 million in the same period of 2011. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments will likely be recorded. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is primarily related to our Marcellus Shale operations and is due, in part, to lower natural gas prices and plans to move towards areas with higher expectation of wet gas.  Deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of $7.8 million in first quarter 2012 compared to a loss of $30.6 million in the same period of 2011. Our stock price decreased to $58.14 at March 31, 2012 compared to $61.94 at December 31, 2011. Our stock price increased to $58.46 at March 31, 2011 compared to $44.98 at December 31, 2010. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense.  Income tax benefit was $27.8 million in first quarter 2012 compared to a benefit of $19.9 million in first quarter 2011. The 2012 decrease in income taxes reflects a 31% decrease in income from continuing operations when compared to the same period of 2011. The effective tax rate was 40.0% in 2012 compared to 37.3% in 2011. The 2012 and 2011 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and changes in our valuation allowances related to our deferred tax asset for future deferred compensation plan distributions to senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation (including these distributions) would exceed the $1.0 million deductible limit provided under section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40% for the remainder of 2012.  Discontinued operations include the operating results and impairment losses related to our Barnett Shale properties. Substantially all of these properties were sold in April 2011 for proceeds of $889.3 million including certain derivatives assumed by the buyer and we recorded a gain of $4.8 million on the sale. See also Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements. Interest expense is allocated to discontinued operations based on the ratio of net assets of discontinued operations to our consolidated net assets plus long-term debt.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, asset sales and access to the debt and equity capital markets. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first quarter 2012, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2012, 2013 and 2014 to protect future cash flows. In March 2012, we issued $600.0 million of new ten-year senior subordinated notes. On April 9, 2012, we increased our facility amount under our bank credit facility from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion.    29    Table of Contents During first quarter 2012, our net cash provided from continuing operations of $156.0 million, proceeds from the sale of assets of $9.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of our 5.00% senior subordinated notes were used to fund $452.8 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At March 31, 2012, we had $122.9 million in cash and total assets of $6.3 billion.  Long-term debt at March 31, 2012 totaled $2.4 billion, with no outstanding balance on our bank credit facility and $2.4 billion of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at March 31, 2012 was $1.5 billion. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A material drop in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Credit Arrangements  As of March 31, 2012, we maintained a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of February 18, 2016. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders semi-annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors but primarily the lenders’ assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of two thirds of the lenders; increases to the borrowing base require 97% lender approval. On April 9, 2012, the facility amount on our bank credit facility was increased from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion and we added three additional banks. The borrowing base remained unchanged at $2.0 billion.  Our bank debt and our subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt and our subordinated notes). The debt agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2012.  Capital Requirements  Our primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. During first quarter 2012, $355.9 million of capital was expended on drilling projects. Also in first quarter 2012, $75.4 million was expended on acquisitions of unproved acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale. Our 2012 capital program, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be funded by net cash flow from operations, proceeds from asset sales and borrowings under our credit facility. Our capital expenditure budget for 2012 is currently set at $1.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. To the extent capital requirements exceed internally generated cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and our committed capacity under our bank credit facility, then debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements. We monitor our capital expenditures on an ongoing basis, adjusting the amount up or down and also between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt.    30    Table of Contents The forward-looking statements about our capital budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for natural gas and oil, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorists acts and the government or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and since our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of March 31, 2012, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 155.9 Bcfe for 2012, 159.5 Bcfe for 2013 and 43.8 Bcfe for 2014.  Net cash provided from continuing operations in first quarter 2012 was $156.0 million compared to $121.2 million in the same period of 2011. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2011 to 2012 reflects a 52% increase in production somewhat offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 22%) and higher operating costs. As of March 31, 2012, we have hedged approximately 73% of our projected 2012 production (based on the mid-point of our projected 2012 production), with approximately 74% of our projected 2012 natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first quarter 2012 was a positive $36.4 million compared to a negative $6.1 million for the same period of 2011.  Net cash provided from discontinued operations for first quarter 2011 was $19.4 million. Substantially all of our Barnett Shale properties were sold in April 2011 with a February 1, 2011 effective date.  Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in first quarter 2012 was $443.9 million compared to $263.6 million in the same period of 2011.  During first quarter 2012, we:        •    spent $376.9 million on natural gas and oil property additions;        •    spent $74.3 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and        •    received proceeds from asset sales of $9.9 million.  During first quarter 2011, we:        •    spent $250.8 million on natural gas and oil property additions;        •    spent $24.3 million on acreage primarily the Marcellus Shale; and        •    received proceeds from asset sales of $15.2 million.  Net cash provided from financing activities in first quarter 2012 was an increase of $410.7 million compared to an increase of $130.0 million in the same period of 2011. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings.  During first quarter 2012, we:        •    borrowed $340.0 million and repaid $527.0 million under our bank credit facility; ending the quarter with no outstanding balance on our bank debt; and    31    Table of Contents     •    issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amounts of our 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2022 with net proceeds of approximately $589.0 million.  During first quarter 2011, we:        •    borrowed $372.8 million and repaid $166.8 million under our bank credit facility, ending the quarter with $206.3 million in higher bank debt.  Cash Dividend Payments  The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures and various other factors. On March 1, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.5 million) on our common stock, which was paid on March 30, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2012.  Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation commitments. As of March 31, 2012, we do not have any capital leases. As of March 31, 2012, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of March 31, 2012, we had a total of $28.6 million of letters of credit outstanding under our bank credit facility supporting obligations in the table below. The table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at March 31, 2012.  The following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at March 31, 2012 and their future maturities. We expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facility, additional debt issuances and proceeds from asset sales (in thousands).

While such payments will be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production, production receipts may be received after our payments to counterparties, which can result in borrowings under our bank credit facility.    (b)   The ultimate settlement amount and timing cannot be precisely determined in advance. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.    (c)   This table excludes the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets.    32    Table of Contents Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives as we typically utilize commodity swap, collar and call option contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. In 2011, we also entered into NGL derivative swap contracts for the natural gasoline component of natural gas liquids. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets.  At March 31, 2012, we had open swap contracts covering 89.7 Bcf of natural gas at prices averaging $3.89 per mcf, 2.8 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $95.27 per barrel and 6.2 million barrels of NGLs (the C5 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $93.16 per barrel. We had collars covering 189.2 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $4.71 to $5.21 per mcf and 2.4 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $84.28 to $95.37 per barrel. We also have sold call options covering 1.3 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $85.00 per barrel and put options for 0.7 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $80.00. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax gain of $275.8 million at March 31, 2012. The contracts expire monthly through December 2014.  At March 31, 2012, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:               Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   WeightedAverage Hedge Price        Natural Gas            2012   Collars   249,859 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.90–$ 5.39   2013   Collars   240,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.73–$ 5.20   2014   Collars   90,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.25–$ 4.85   2012   Swaps   189,927 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.05   2013   Swaps   102,521 Mmbtu/day   $ 3.66        Crude Oil            2012   Collars   2,000 bbls/day   $ 70.00–$ 80.00   2013   Collars   3,000 bbls/day   $ 90.60–$ 100.00   2014   Collars   2,000 bbls/day   $ 85.55–$ 100.00   2012   Call options   4,700 bbls/day   $ 85.00   2012   Put option   2,500 bbls/day   $ 80.00   2013   Swaps   6,313 bbls/day   $ 96.49   2014   Swaps   3,000 bbls/day   $ 93.33        NGLs (Natural Gasoline)            2012   Swaps   12,000 bbls/day   $ 96.28   2013   Swaps   8,000 bbls/day   $ 89.64  Interest Rates  At March 31, 2012, we had $2.4 billion of debt outstanding which bears interest at fixed rates averaging 6.4%.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.    33    Table of Contents Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs in 2012 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.    34    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are US dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivatives instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Natural gas prices affect us more than oil prices because approximately 79% of our December 31, 2011 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012.  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establishes a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. We have also entered into call option derivative contracts under which we sold call options in exchange for a premium from the counterparty. At the time of settlement of these monthly call options, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, we will pay the counterparty such excess and if the market settle below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from either party. At March 31, 2012, our derivatives program includes swaps, collars, call and put options. As of March 31, 2012, we had open swap contracts covering 89.7 Bcf of natural gas at price averaging $3.89 per mcf, 2.8 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $95.27 per barrel and 6.2 million barrels of NGLs (the C5 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $93.16 per barrel. We had collars covering 189.2 Bcf of gas at weighted floor and cap prices of $4.71 to $5.21 per mcf and 2.4 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $84.28 to $95.37 per barrel. We also have sold call options covering 1.3 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $85.00 per barrel and put options for 0.7 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $80.00. These contracts expire monthly through December 2014. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of March 31, 2012, approximated a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $275.8 million.

In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGL production and we believe NGL prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the percentage of NGL prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand.  As of March 31, 2012, the relationship between the price of oil and the price of natural gas is at an unprecedented spread. Normally, natural gas liquids production is a by-product of natural gas production. Due to the current differences in prices, we and other producers may choose to sell natural gas at below cost or otherwise dispose of natural gas to allow for the sale of only natural gas liquids.  Currently, there is little demand, or facilities to supply the existing demand, for ethane in the Appalachian region so, for our Appalachian production volumes, ethane remains in the natural gas stream. We currently have waivers from two transmission pipelines that allow us to leave ethane in the residue natural gas. We believe the limits are sufficient to cover our production through 2014. We have recently announced two ethane agreements where we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, both to begin operations in late 2013 and early 2014. We cannot assure you that these facilities will become available. If we are not able to sell ethane, we may be required to curtail production which will adversely affect our revenues.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. At times, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements in the past that effectively fix the basis adjustments. We currently have no basis swap agreements outstanding.  The following table shows the fair value of our collars, swaps and call options and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at March 31, 2012. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                                      Hypothetical Changein Fair ValueIncrease of     Hypothetical Changein Fair ValueDecrease of        Fair Value     10%     25%     10%     25%     Collars   $ 265,041     $ (76,961 )    $ (192,056 )    $ 77,201     $ 193,851     Call options     (26,572 )      (12,558 )      (32,227 )      11,388       22,679     Swaps     36,955       (113,771 )      (284,257 )      114,336       286,738     Put options     423       (253 )      (373 )      644       3,849    Our commodity-based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with the majority of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At March 31, 2012, our derivative counterparties include thirteen financial institutions, of which all but two are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts have been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At March 31, 2012, we had $2.4 billion of debt outstanding which bears interest at fixed rates averaging 6.4%. On March 31, 2012, we had no outstanding balance on our bank credit facility.    36    Table of Contents   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2012 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    37    Table of Contents PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  On December 7, 2010, Region VI of the EPA issued an administrative order under the Safe Drinking Water Act against Range and our subsidiary Range Production Company. The EPA filed suit against us in January 2011 seeking to enforce the order in United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. We filed an appeal of the December 7, 2010 order with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Effective March 29, 2012, the EPA withdrew the December 7, 2010 administrative order and the suit seeking enforcement of the order was dismissed by EPA with our concurrence. Our appeal of the December 7, 2010 order, having been mooted by the withdrawal of the order, was dismissed by us.      ITEM 1A.
