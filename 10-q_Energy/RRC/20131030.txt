Item 1A. Risk Factors as filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2013.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company primarily engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian and Southwestern regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments.  Our objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. We include condensate in our crude oil captions below. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Our corporate headquarters is located at 100 Throckmorton Street, Fort Worth, Texas.  Market Conditions  Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for commodities are inherently volatile. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGL composite price for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012:          Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         2013        2012        2013        2012      Average NYMEX prices (a)                                                Natural gas (per mcf)  $  3.60        $  2.81        $  3.68        $  2.61      Oil (per bbl)  $  105.87        $  92.58        $  98.47        $  95.78      Mont Belvieu NGL Composite (per gallon)  $  0.78        $  0.79        $  0.77        $  0.92    (a) Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.         26          Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview of Third Quarter 2013 Results  During third quarter 2013, we achieved the following financial and operating results:      ·  increased revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil by 28% from the same period of 2012;     ·  achieved 21% production growth from the same period of 2012;     ·  continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania by growing production, proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage;     ·  continued expansion of our activities in the horizontal Mississippian play in Oklahoma by growing production;     ·  reduced direct operating expenses per mcfe 15% from the same period of 2012;     ·  reduced our depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) rate 12% from the same period of 2012;     ·  received proceeds of $15.7 million from the sale of an equity method investment and other non-core assets;     ·  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2013, 2014 and 2015; and     ·  realized $223.0 million of cash flow from operating activities. For the third quarter, total revenues increased $142.3 million or 47% over the same period of 2012. This increase was due to significantly higher production volumes, an increase in brokered natural gas volumes and a higher gain on the sale of assets. Our third quarter 2013 production growth was due to the continued success of our drilling program, particularly in the Marcellus Shale.  Overview of Nine Months 2013 Results  During the nine months ending September 30, 2013, we achieved the following financial and operating results:      ·  increased revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil by 33% from the same period of 2012;     ·  achieved 26% production growth from the same period of 2012;     ·  reduced direct operating expense per mcfe 12% from the same period of 2012;     ·  reduced our DD&A rate 13% from the same period of 2012;     ·  continued our expansion in the Marcellus Shale and the horizontal Mississippian plays;     ·  issued $750.0 million of new 5% senior subordinated notes due 2023;     ·  redeemed all $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2018;     ·  received proceeds of $311.7 million from the sale of non-core assets;     ·  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2013, 2014 and 2015; and     ·  realized $502.9 million of cash flow from operating activities (after giving effect to the $87.5 million Oklahoma lawsuit settlement payment). Total revenues increased $435.0 million or 44% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. This increase was due to significantly higher production volumes, an increase in brokered natural gas volumes and higher gains on the sale of assets partially offset by lower realized gains on derivative settlements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, natural gas production increased 25% while oil and NGLs production increased 32% from the same period of the prior year.  We believe natural gas, NGLs and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new technology and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for the remainder of 2013 and for 2014 and 2015, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices that we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future.         27          Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices, production volumes and the value of certain of our derivative contracts. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales include netback arrangements where we sell natural gas and oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. In this instance, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. Revenues are also realized from sales arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at a specific delivery point and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation deduction. Third party transportation costs we incur to get our commodity to the delivery point are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense. Hedges included in natural gas, NGLs and oil sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting. Cash settlements and changes in the market value of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in derivative fair value income or loss in the statement of operations. For more information on revenues from derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges, see the derivative fair value (loss) income discussion below. Effective March 1, 2013, we elected to de-designate all commodity contracts that were previously designated as cash flow hedges and elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.  In third quarter 2013, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 28% from the same period of 2012 with a 21% increase in production and a 5% increase in realized prices. In the first nine months 2013, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 33% from the same period of 2012 with a 26% increase in production and a 5% increase in realized prices. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         2013        2012        Change        %        2013     2012     Change        %                                                                                           Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                                                                    Gas wellhead  $  233,019        $  159,525        $  73,494        46  %     $  718,176     $  399,006     $  319,170        80  %   Gas hedges realized (a)     25,870           62,150           (36,280  )     (58  %)        90,693        198,675        (107,982  )     (54  %)   Total gas revenue  $  258,889        $  221,675        $  37,214        17  %     $  808,869     $  597,681     $  211,188        35  %   Total NGLs revenue  $  77,317        $  56,826        $  20,491        36  %     $  211,475     $  189,604     $  21,871        12  %   Oil wellhead  $  93,473        $  59,221        $  34,252        58  %     $  243,057     $  166,718     $  76,339        46  %   Oil hedges realized (a)     1,535           (682  )        2,217        325  %        3,730        (997  )     4,727        474  %   Total oil revenue  $  95,008        $  58,539        $  36,469        62  %     $  246,787     $  165,721     $  81,066        49  %   Combined wellhead  $  403,809        $  275,572        $  128,237        47  %        1,172,708     $  755,328        417,380        55  %   Combined hedges (a)      27,405           61,468           (34,063  )     (55  %)        94,423        197,678        (103,255  )     (52  %)   Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales  $  431,214        $  337,040        $  94,174        28  %     $  1,267,131     $    953,006     $  314,125        33  %        (a) Cash settlements related to derivatives that qualified or were historically designated for hedge accounting.          28          Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production partially offset by the natural decline of our natural gas and oil wells and asset sales. When compared to the same period of 2012, our third quarter 2013 production volumes increased 25% in our Appalachian region and increased 3% in our Southwestern region despite the second quarter 2013 sale of our Delaware and Permian Basin properties in New Mexico and West Texas. When compared to the same period of 2012, our production volumes for the nine months 2013 increased 33% in our Appalachian region and decreased 4% in our Southwestern region with the decrease primarily due to the sale of our properties in New Mexico and West Texas. When compared to the same period of 2012, our Marcellus production volumes increased 32% for the third quarter and 44% for the nine months 2013. Our production for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 is set forth in the following table:            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         2013        2012        Change        %        2013     2012     Change        %                                                                                           Production (a)                                                                                    Natural gas (mcf)     68,024,813           57,347,638           10,677,175        19  %        194,975,047        156,274,072        38,700,975        25  %   NGLs (bbls)     2,362,340           1,843,667           518,673        28  %        6,367,253        4,975,086        1,392,167        28  %   Crude oil (bbls)     1,018,013           712,858           305,155        43  %        2,795,192        1,943,961        851,231        44  %   Total (mcfe) (b)     88,306,931           72,686,788           15,620,143        21  %        249,949,717        197,788,354        52,161,363        26  %   Average daily production (a)                                                                                     Natural gas (mcf)     739,400           623,344           116,056        19  %         714,194        570,343        143,851        25  %    NGLs (bbls)     25,678           20,040           5,638        28  %        23,323        18,157        5,166        28  %   Crude oil (bbls)     11,065           7,748           3,317        43  %        10,239        7,095        3,144        44  %   Total (mcfe) (b)     959,858           790,074           169,784        21  %        915,567        721,855        193,712        27  %      (a)  Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.     (b)  Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.        29          Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received during third quarter 2013 was $4.11 per mcfe compared to $4.17 per mcfe in the same period of 2012. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received was $4.20 in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $4.24 in the same period of the prior year. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualified for hedge accounting. Average sales prices (wellhead) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying statements of operations. Average sales prices (wellhead) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.

Derivative fair value (loss) income was a loss of $40.4 million in third quarter 2013 compared to a loss of $40.7 million in the same period of 2012. Derivative fair value (loss) income was a loss of $2.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to income of $47.0 million in the same period of 2012. Our derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value income or loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Mark-to-market accounting treatment results in volatility of our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in derivative fair value income or loss, is associated with contracts that qualified for hedge accounting. The ineffective portion is calculated as the difference between the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the estimated change in future cash flows from the item being hedged. Effective March 1, 2013, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. After March 1, 2013, all realized and unrealized gains and losses will be recognized in earnings in derivative fair value income or loss immediately as derivative contracts are settled or marked to market.         30          The following table presents information about the components of derivative fair value (loss) income for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         2013        2012        2013        2012                                                       Change in fair value of derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting (a)  $  (34,219  )     $  (53,646  )     $  28,350        $  30,075      Realized gain (loss) on settlements – natural gas (b) (c)     5,815           —            (17,913  )        —       Realized (loss) gain on settlements – oil (b) (c)     (8,005  )        1,955           (8,218  )        (1,899  )   Realized (loss) gain on settlements – NGLs (b) (c)     (3,907  )        14,682           (1,759  )        20,442      Hedge ineffectiveness – realized (c)     (854  )        988           (445  )        3,451           – unrealized (a)     815           (4,707  )        (2,485  )        (5,061  )   Derivative fair value (loss) income  $  (40,355  )     $  (40,728  )     $  (2,470  )     $  47,008         (a)  These amounts are unrealized and are not included in average realized price calculations.     (b)  These amounts represent realized gains and losses on settled derivatives that did not qualify or were not designated for hedge accounting.     (c)  These settlements are included in average realized price calculations (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range). Gain (loss) on the sale of assets was a gain of $6.0 million in third quarter 2013 compared to a gain of $949,000 in the same period of 2012. In third quarter 2013, we recorded gains of $6.0 million on the sale of our equity method investment in a drilling company and other non-core assets, from which we received total proceeds of $15.7 million. In third quarter 2012, we recorded a $746,000 gain on the sale of unproved property in Pennsylvania where we received proceeds of $13.9 million. Gain (loss) on the sale of assets was a gain of $89.1 million in the first nine months 2013 compared to a loss of $12.7 million in the same period of 2012. In the first nine months 2013, we also sold our New Mexico and certain West Texas properties where we recognized a gain of $83.3 million, before selling expenses. In the first nine months 2012, we also sold a seventy-five percent interest in an East Texas prospect which included a suspended exploratory well and unproved properties for proceeds of $8.6 million resulting in a pre-tax loss of $10.9 million and we recorded a $2.5 million pre-tax loss on the sale of a Marcellus exploratory well where we received proceeds of $2.5 million.  Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in third quarter 2013 was $45.2 million compared to $2.5 million in the same period of 2012. The third quarter 2013 includes income from equity method investments of $268,000 and revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas of $45.5 million. The third quarter 2012 includes loss from equity method investments of $1.0 million and revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas of $3.4 million. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in the first nine months 2013 was $80.8 million compared to $12.4 million in the same period of 2012. The first nine months 2013 includes income from equity method investments of $541,000 and $81.0 million of revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas. The first nine months 2012 includes loss from equity method investments of $195,000 and $12.1 million of revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas. These revenues are increasing due to an increase in brokered volumes, due in part to our purchase (and sale) of natural gas which is used to blend our rich residue gas from the Southwest Marcellus Shale.  We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012:            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         (per mcfe)        (per mcfe)         2013        2012        Change        % Change        2013        2012        Change        % Change                                                                                                 Direct operating expense  $  0.35        $  0.41        $  (0.06  )     (15  %)     $  0.38        $  0.43        $  (0.05  )     (12  %)   Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.13           0.12           0.01        8  %        0.14           0.29           (0.15  )     (52  %)   General and administrative expense     0.51           0.61           (0.10  )     (16  %)        0.92           0.64           0.28        44  %   Interest expense     0.50           0.61           (0.11  )     (18  %)        0.53           0.63           (0.10  )     (16  %)   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     1.48           1.69           (0.21  )     (12  %)        1.46           1.68           (0.22  )     (13  %)        31          Direct operating expense was $30.9 million in third quarter 2013 compared to $29.6 million in the same period of 2012. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and manage existing properties. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Even though our production volumes increased 21%, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for third quarter 2013 only increased 4% with an increase in the number of producing wells, higher workover costs and higher utility costs somewhat offset by the sale of certain non-core assets at the beginning of second quarter 2013. We incurred $2.0 million of workover costs in third quarter 2013 compared to $1.4 million of workover costs in the same period of 2012.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in third quarter 2013 declined 15% from the same period of 2012 with the decrease consisting of lower well services and water handling costs. We expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas. Operating costs in the Mississippian play are higher on a per mcfe basis than the Marcellus Shale play. As production increases from the Mississippian play, our direct operating expenses per mcfe are expected to begin to increase.  Direct operating expense was $93.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $85.7 million in the same period of 2012. Even though our production volumes increased 26%, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses only increased 9% with an increase in the number of producing wells and higher utilities, well services, workovers, well insurance and personnel costs somewhat offset by the sale of certain non-core assets. We incurred $5.5 million of workover costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $3.5 million in the same period of 2012. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 decreased 12% to $0.38 from $0.43 in the same period of 2012, with the decrease consisting of lower well services, water handling and personnel costs. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and SARs as part of the compensation of field employees. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012:            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         (per mcfe)        (per mcfe)         2013        2012        Change        % Change        2013        2012        Change        % Change                                                                                                 Lease operating expense  $  0.32        $  0.38        $  (0.06  )     (16  %)     $  0.35        $  0.40        $  (0.05  )      (13  %)   Workovers     0.02           0.02           —         —   %        0.02           0.02           —         —   %   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.01           0.01           —         —   %        0.01           0.01           —         —   %   Total direct operating expense  $  0.35        $  0.41        $  (0.06  )     (15  %)     $  0.38        $  0.43        $  (0.05  )     (12  %) Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee that was initially assessed in 2012. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $4.5 million in third quarter 2013 compared to $3.4 million in the same period of 2012. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) was $0.05 in both third quarter 2013 and third quarter 2012 with an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes and the sale of non-core assets in New Mexico and West Texas offset by higher prices. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” on unconventional natural gas and oil production which includes the Marcellus Shale. Included in third quarter 2013 is a $7.0 million impact fee ($0.08 per mcfe) compared to $5.4 million ($0.07 per mcfe) in the same period of the prior year.  Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $12.8 million ($0.05 per mcfe) in the first nine months 2013 compared to $14.5 million ($0.07 per mcfe) in the same period of 2012 due to an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes and the sale of certain non-core assets in New Mexico and West Texas partially offset by higher prices. Included in the nine months 2013 is a $21.2 million ($0.08 per mcfe) impact fee compared to $18.0 million ($0.09 per mcfe) in the same period of 2012. The nine months ended September 30, 2012 also includes $24.7 million ($0.12 per mcfe) retroactive impact fee which covered wells drilled prior to 2012.         32          General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $44.9 million in third quarter 2013 compared to $44.5 million for the same period of 2012. The third quarter 2013 increase of $422,000 when compared to 2012 is primarily due to higher salary and benefit expenses of $1.5 million and an increase in stock-based compensation of $974,000 partially offset by lower legal and office expenses, including information technology. We continue to incur higher wages which we consider necessary to remain competitive in the industry. G&A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 increased $103.7 million or 82% from the same period of the prior year primarily due to a legal settlement related to an Oklahoma lawsuit of $87.5 million, higher salary and benefit expenses of $6.0 million, an increase in stock-based compensation of $3.8 million and higher legal and office expenses, including information technology. Our number of G&A employees increased 6% from September 30, 2012 to September 30, 2013. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and SARs granted to our employees and non-employee directors as part of compensation. On a per mcfe basis, G&A expense decreased 16% from third quarter 2012 and increased 44% from the nine months ended September 30, 2012 primarily due to the Oklahoma legal settlement. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012:            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         (per mcfe)        (per mcfe)         2013        2012        Change        % Change        2013        2012        Change        % Change                                                                                                 General and administrative  $  0.39        $  0.47        $  0.08        (17  %)     $  0.43        $  0.48        $  (0.05  )      (10  %)   Oklahoma legal settlement     —            —            —         —   %        0.35           —            0.35        —   %   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.12           0.14           (0.02  )     (14  %)        0.14           0.16           (0.02  )     (13  %)   Total general and administrative expenses  $  0.51        $  0.61           (0.10  )     (16  %)     $  0.92        $  0.64        $  0.28        44  % Interest expense was $44.3 million for third quarter 2013 compared to $44.0 million for third quarter 2012 and was $131.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $124.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The following table presents information about interest expense for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         2013        2012        2013        2012                                                       Bank credit facility  $  3,168        $  3,224        $  10,022        $  7,884      Subordinated notes     38,501           38,344           113,571           109,365      Amortization of deferred financing costs and other     2,652           2,429           8,009           6,841      Total interest expense  $  44,321        $  43,997        $  131,602        $  124,090    The increase in interest expense for third quarter 2013 from the same period of 2012 was primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt balances. In March 2013, we issued $750.0 million of 5.0% senior subordinated notes due 2023. We used the proceeds to repay our outstanding bank debt which carries a lower interest rate. In March 2012, we issued $600.0 million of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay $350.0 million of our outstanding credit facility balance and for general corporate purposes. The 2013 and 2012 note issuances were undertaken to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for third quarter 2013 was $409.8 million compared to $375.2 million in the same period of 2012 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 1.9% in third quarter 2013 compared to 2.1% in the same period of 2012.  The increase in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 from the same period of 2012 was primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt balances. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $419.6 million compared to $239.9 million for 2012 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to 2.2% in the same period of 2012.         33          Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) was $130.3 million in third quarter 2013 compared to $123.1 million in the same period of 2012. The increase in third quarter 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012 is due to a 12% decrease in depletion rates more than offset by a 21% increase in production. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $1.41 per mcfe in third quarter 2013 compared to $1.61 per mcfe in the same period of 2012. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to our drilling success in the Marcellus Shale.  DD&A was $365.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $332.0 million in the same period of 2012. Depletion expense was $1.39 per mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.60 per mcfe in the same period of 2012. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012:            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         (per mcfe)        (per mcfe)         2013        2012        Change        % Change        2013        2012        Change        % Change                                                                                                 Depletion and amortization  $  1.41        $  1.61        $  (0.20  )     (12  %)     $  1.39        $  1.60        $  (0.21  )     (13  %)   Depreciation     0.04           0.04           —         —   %        0.04           0.05           (0.01  )     (20  %)   Accretion and other     0.03           0.04           (0.01  )     (25  %)        0.03           0.03           —         —   %   Total DD&A expense  $  1.48        $  1.69        $  (0.21  )     (12  %)     $  1.46        $  1.68        $  (0.22  )     (13  %) Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, transportation, gathering and compression expense, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, deferred compensation plan expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and impairment of proved properties. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants and SARs grants. The following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation that is allocated to functional expense categories for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         2013        2012        2013        2012                                                       Direct operating expense  $  699        $  598        $  2,056        $  1,647      Brokered natural gas and marketing expense     531           452           1,310           1,313      Exploration expense     983           1,126           3,013           3,048      General and administrative expense     11,031           10,057           34,600           30,755      Total stock-based compensation  $  13,244        $  12,233        $  40,979        $  36,763    Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $61.0 million in third quarter 2013 compared to $51.6 million in the same period of 2012. Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $189.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $137.2 million in the same period of 2012. These third party costs are higher than 2012 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering, compression and transportation agreements. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range).  Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $51.1 million in third quarter 2013 compared to $4.9 million in the same period of 2012. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $90.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $15.4 million in the same period of 2012. These costs are higher than 2012 primarily due to an increase in brokered volumes due in part to our purchase (and sale) of natural gas which is used to blend our rich residue gas from the Southwest Marcellus Shale.         34          Exploration expense was $20.5 million in third quarter 2013 compared to $14.8 million in the same period of 2012. Exploration expense was higher in third quarter 2013 when compared to 2012 due to higher seismic, dry hole costs and delay rentals. The nine months ended September 30, 2013 includes lower seismic partially offset by higher dry hole and personnel costs compared to the same period of 2012. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):            Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,         2013        2012        Change        % Change        2013        2012        Change        % Change                                                                                                 Seismic  $  7,621        $  6,995        $  626        9  %     $  20,866        $  26,763        $  (5,897  )      (22  %)   Delay rentals and other     4,337           3,495           842        24  %        11,439           11,084           355        3  %   Personnel expense     3,493           3,121           372        12  %        11,122           10,059           1,063        11  %   Stock-based compensation expense     983           1,126           (143  )     (13  %)        3,013           3,047           (34  )     (1  %)   Dry hole expense     4,062           15           4,047        NM           3,904           832           3,072        369  %   Total exploration expense  $  20,496        $  14,752        $  5,744        39  %     $  50,344        $  51,785        $  (1,441  )     (3  %) Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $11.7 million in third quarter 2013 compared to $40.1 million in the same period of 2012. Abandonment and impairment was $46.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $104.0 million in the same period of 2012. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments will likely be recorded. In second quarter 2012, we impaired individually significant unproved properties in Pennsylvania for $23.1 million because we determined that we were not going to drill in the area. In third quarter 2012, we impaired individually significant unproved properties in the Barnett Shale of North Texas for $19.6 million because we determined we would not drill and would allow the leases to expire.  Deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of $2.2 million in third quarter 2013 compared to a loss of $20.1 million in the same period of 2012. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price decreased from $77.32 at June 30, 2013 to $75.89 at September 30, 2013. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price increased from $61.87 at June 30, 2012 to $69.87 at September 30, 2012. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013 deferred compensation plan expense was $33.3 million compared to $21.6 million in the same period of 2012. Our stock price increased from $62.83 at December 31, 2012 to $75.89 at September 30, 2013. In the same nine months of 2012, our stock price decreased from $61.94 at December 31, 2011 to $69.87 at September 30, 2012.  Loss on extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was $12.3 million. On May 2, 2013, we redeemed all of our $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2018 at 103.625% of par and we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $12.3 million which includes a call premium and the expensing of related deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt.  Impairment of proved properties and other assets was $7.0 million in third quarter 2013 and $7.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to $1.3 million in the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The third quarter 2013 includes a $7.0 million impairment related to certain South Texas wells. Our analysis of these properties determined that undiscounted cash flows were less than their carrying value. We compared the carrying value to their estimated fair value and recognized an impairment charge. We evaluated these assets for impairment due to declining reserves. The nine months ended September 30, 2013 also includes a $741,000 impairment related to some surface acreage in North Texas. The third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 includes a $1.3 million impairment on surface acreage in North Texas.         35          Income tax expense (benefit) was an expense of $11.9 million in third quarter 2013 compared to a benefit of $29.1 million in third quarter 2012. The increase in income taxes in third quarter 2013 reflects a 137% increase in income from operations when compared to the same period of 2012. For the third quarter, the effective tax rate was 38.2% in 2013 compared to 35.1% in 2012. Income tax expense was $62.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to an income tax benefit of $17.9 million in the same period of 2012. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the increase in income taxes reflects a 359% increase in income from operations when compared to the prior year period. For the nine months September 30, 2013, the effective tax rate was 41.5% compared to 30.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The 2013 and 2012 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, permanent differences and changes in our valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets associated with senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation, which includes distributions from the deferred compensation plan, is expected to exceed the $1.0 million deductible limit provided under section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Our 2013 effective tax rate was also different from the statutory rate due to deferred tax assets related to capital losses realized which are more likely than not recoverable and the reversal of a valuation allowance previously recorded related to our Pennsylvania net operating losses due to a change in Pennsylvania legislation enacted in July 2013. The U.S. Treasury Department issued the final Tangible Property Regulations in third quarter 2013. The adoption of these final regulations are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements or our federal or state income tax positions. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40% for the remainder of 2013.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and since our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of September 30, 2013, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 68.9 Bcfe for the remainder of 2013, 213.7 Bcfe for 2014 and 60.0 Bcfe for 2015.  Net cash provided from operations in the first nine months 2013 was $502.9 million compared to $461.1 million in the same period of 2012. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2012 to 2013 reflects a 26% increase in production offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 1%) and higher operating costs, including the settlement payment of the $87.5 million related to Oklahoma lawsuit settlement. As of September 30, 2013, we have hedged approximately 76% of our projected production for the remainder of 2013, with approximately 76% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first nine months 2013 was negative $48.0 million compared to positive $26.3 million for the same period of 2012.  Net cash used in investing activities from operations in first nine months 2013 was $671.1 million compared to $1.3 billion in the same period of 2012.         36          During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we:      ·  spent $907.8 million on natural gas and oil property additions;     ·  spent $70.2 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and     ·  received proceeds from asset sales of $311.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, we:      ·  spent $1.2 billion on natural gas and oil property additions;     ·  spent $175.0 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and     ·  received proceeds from asset sales of $32.1 million. Net cash provided from financing activities in first nine months 2013 was $168.3 million compared to $848.6 million in the same period of 2012. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we:      ·  borrowed $1.3 billion and repaid $1.6 billion under our bank credit facility, ending the quarter with a $427.0 million outstanding balance on our bank debt;     ·  issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2023, at par, with net proceeds of approximately $738.8 million;     ·  redeemed all $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2018 including related expenses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2012, we:      ·  borrowed $1.1 billion and repaid $865.0 million under our bank credit facility, ending the quarter with $461.0 million outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility;     ·  issued $600.0 million principal amount of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2022, at par, with net proceeds of approximately $589.5 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first nine months 2013, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2013, 2014 and 2015 to protect future cash flows. In March 2013, we issued $750.0 million of new 5.00% ten-year senior subordinated notes due 2023. On April 2, 2013, we called for redemption the entire $250.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2018 which were redeemed on May 2, 2013. On October 18, 2013, our borrowing base and our credit facility amounts were reaffirmed.  During the first nine of months 2013, our net cash provided from continuing operations of $502.9 million, proceeds from the sale of assets of $311.7 million, proceeds from the issuance of our 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2023 and borrowings under our bank credit facility were used to fund $982.2 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At September 30, 2013, we had $255,000 in cash and total assets of $7.0 billion.  Long-term debt at September 30, 2013 totaled $3.1 billion, including $427.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility and $2.6 billion of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at September 30, 2013 was $1.2 billion. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A material drop in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and remain profitable.        37          We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Our expectations concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Credit Arrangements  As of September 30, 2013, we maintained a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of February 18, 2016. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders semi-annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors but primarily on the lenders’ assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of two thirds of the lenders; increases to the borrowing base require 97% lender approval. On October 18, 2013, the facility amount on our bank credit facility was reaffirmed at $1.75 billion and our borrowing base was reaffirmed at $2.0 billion. Our current bank group is currently composed of twenty-eight financial institutions.  Our bank debt and our subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt and our subordinated notes). The debt agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. We are in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2013.  Capital Requirements  Our primary capital requirements are for exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. During the first nine months of 2013, $951.0 million of capital was expended on drilling projects. Also in the first nine months of 2013, $70.0 million was expended on acquisitions of unproved acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale. Our 2013 capital program, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be funded by net cash flow from operations, our prior debt offering, proceeds from asset sales and borrowings under our bank credit facility. Our capital expenditure budget for 2013 is currently set at $1.35 billion, excluding proved property acquisitions. To the extent capital requirements exceed internally generated cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and our committed capacity under our bank credit facility will be used to fund these requirements. In addition, debt or equity may also be issued in capital market transactions to fund these requirements. We monitor our capital expenditures on an ongoing basis, adjusting the amount up or down and also between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt.  The forward-looking statements about our capital budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for natural gas and oil, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorists acts and the government or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.         38          Cash Dividend Payments  The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors. On September 1, 2013, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.5 million) on our common stock, which was paid on September 30, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 16, 2013.  Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation and gathering commitments. As of September 30, 2013, we do not have any capital leases. As of September 30, 2013, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of September 30, 2013, we had a total of $84.9 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2012, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $312.0 million reduction to our outstanding bank credit facility balance, an issuance of $750.0 million of new 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2023, a redemption of $250.0 million 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2018 and rate adjustments to certain transportation and gathering contracts which increased these commitments by approximately $150.0 million over the next 10 years.  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives, as we typically utilize commodity swap and collar contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. In 2011, we also entered into “sold” NGLs derivative swap contracts for the natural gasoline component of NGLs and in 2012 we entered into “re-purchased” derivative swaps for the natural gasoline component of NGLs. In addition, in third quarter 2012, we entered into NGLs derivative swap contracts for propane and in third quarter 2013, we entered into NGLs derivative swap contracts for normal butane. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our on-going development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets.  At September 30, 2013, we had open swap contracts covering 40.7 Bcf of natural gas at prices averaging $3.94 per mcf, 3.9 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $93.83 per barrel, 0.6 million net barrels of NGLs (the C5 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $92.72 per barrel, 3.6 million barrels of NGLs (the C3 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $39.67 per barrel and 0.9 million barrels of NGLs (the C4 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $54.77. We had collars covering 242.0 Bcf of natural gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $3.97 to $4.56 per mcf and 1.0 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $86.94 to $100.00 per barrel. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax gain of $66.0 million at September 30, 2013. The contracts expire monthly through December 2015.         39          At September 30, 2013, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:         Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     Weighted Average Hedge Price   Natural Gas                     2013     Collars     280,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.59–$ 5.05   2014     Collars     447,500 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.84–$ 4.48   2015     Collars     145,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.07–$ 4.56   2013     Swaps     293,370 Mmbtu/day     $3.82   2014     Swaps     30,000 Mmbtu/day     $4.17   2015     Swaps     7,500 Mmbtu/day     $4.16                         Crude Oil                     2013     Collars     3,000 bbls/day     $ 90.60–$ 100.00   2014     Collars     2,000 bbls/day     $ 85.55–$ 100.00   2013     Swaps     6,825 bbls/day     $96.79   2014     Swaps     7,000 bbls/day     $94.14   2015     Swaps     2,000 bbls/day     $90.20                         NGLs (Natural Gasoline)                     2013     Sold Swaps     8,000 bbls/day     $89.64   2013     Re-purchased Swaps     1,500 bbls/day     $76.30                         NGLs (Propane)                     2013     Swaps     11,000 bbls/day     $37.87   2014     Swaps     7,000 bbls/day     $40.38                         NGLs (Normal butane)                     2013     Swaps     2,000 bbls/day     $55.44   2014     Swaps     2,000 bbls/day     $54.60 Interest Rates  At September 30, 2013, we had approximately $3.1 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.7 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.8%. Bank debt totaling $427.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 1.9% at September 30, 2013. The 30-day LIBOR rate on September 30, 2013 was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2013 would cost us approximately $4.3 million in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2013 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.           40          ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivatives instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Natural gas prices affect us more than oil prices because approximately 74% of our December 31, 2012 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2012 to September 30, 2013.  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. At September 30, 2013, our derivatives program includes swaps (both purchased and sold NGLs swaps) and collars. As of September 30, 2013, we had open swap contracts covering 40.7 Bcf of natural gas at prices averaging $3.94 per mcf, 3.9 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $93.83 per barrel, 0.6 million net barrels of NGLs (the C5 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $92.72 per barrel, 3.6 million barrels of NGLs (the C3 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $39.67 per barrel and 0.9 million barrels of NGLs (the C4 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $54.77 per barrel. We had collars covering 242.0 Bcf of natural gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $3.97 to $4.56 per mcf and 1.0 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $86.94 to $100.00 per barrel. These contracts expire monthly through December 2015. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of September 30, 2013, approximated a net unrealized pretax gain of $66.0 million.         41          At September 30, 2013, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:       Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     Weighted Average Hedge Price     Fair Market Value                           (in thousands)   Natural Gas                           2013     Collars     280,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.59–$ 5.05     $25,983   2014     Collars     447,500 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.84–$ 4.48     $34,197   2015     Collars     145,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.07–$ 4.56     $9,799   2013     Swaps     293,370 Mmbtu/day     $3.82     $6,068   2014     Swaps     30,000 Mmbtu/day     $4.17     $3,393   2015     Swaps     7,500 Mmbtu/day     $4.16     $285                               Crude Oil                           2013     Collars     3,000 bbls/day     $ 90.60–$ 100.00     $(870)   2014     Collars     2,000 bbls/day     $ 85.55–$ 100.00     $(796)   2013     Swaps     6,825 bbls/day     $96.79     $(2,983)   2014     Swaps     7,000 bbls/day     $94.14     $(3,028)   2015     Swaps     2,000 bbls/day     $90.20     $1,207                               NGLs (Natural Gasoline)                           2013     Sold Swaps     8,000 bbls/day     $89.64     $1,461   2013     Re-purchased Swaps     1,500 bbls/day     $76.30     $1,902                               NGLs (Propane)                           2013     Swaps     11,000 bbls/day     $37.87     $(6,927)   2014     Swaps     7,000 bbls/day     $40.38     $(3,534)                               NGLs (Normal butane)                           2013     Swaps     2,000 bbls/day     $55.44     $(570)   2014     Swaps     2,000 bbls/day     $54.60     $406 We expect our NGLs production to continue to increase. In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGLs production and we believe NGL prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the percentage of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional markets. Over 70% of our NGLs production is in the Marcellus Shale.  Currently, because there is little demand, or facilities to supply the existing demand, for ethane in the Appalachian region, for our Appalachian production volumes, ethane remains in the natural gas stream. In third quarter 2013, we began purchasing natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas to meet transmission pipeline specifications. We have announced three ethane agreements where we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, which are expected to begin operations at various times in late 2013 through 2015. We cannot assure you that these facilities will become available.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. At times, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements in the past that effectively fix the basis adjustments. We currently have no financial basis swap agreements outstanding.         42          The following table shows the fair value of our collars and swaps and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at September 30, 2013. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                   Hypothetical Change in Fair Value        Hypothetical Change in Fair Value                  Increase of        Decrease of         Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%                                                                   Collars  $  68,313        $  (79,068  )     $  (201,246  )     $  79,434        $  211,730      Swaps  (2,320  )     (76,462  )     (190,960  )     77,348        193,500    Our commodity-based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with the majority of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At September 30, 2013, our derivative counterparties include fifteen financial institutions, of which all but two are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts have been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At September 30, 2013, we had $3.1 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.7 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.8%. Bank debt totaling $427.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 1.9% on September 30, 2013. On September 30, 2013, the 30-day LIBOR rate was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2013, would cost us approximately $4.3 million in additional annual interest expense.    ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2013 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.         43          PART II – OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1.
