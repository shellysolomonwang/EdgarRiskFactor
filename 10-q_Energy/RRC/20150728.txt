Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2015.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company primarily engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian and Midcontinent regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect:     ●  the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures;     ●  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital;      ●  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce; and     ●  revenues and profitability. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Market Conditions Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for commodities are inherently volatile and have decreased significantly in recent months. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGL composite price for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:            Three Months EndedJune 30,           Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015           2014           2015           2014       Average NYMEX prices (a)                                                 Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.64        $  4.67        $  2.81        $  4.79       Oil (per bbl)     57.88           102.97           53.14           100.74       Mont Belvieu NGL composite (per gallon) (b)     0.41           0.81           0.42           0.86          (a)  Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.      (b)  Based on our estimated NGL product component per barrel. 23  Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview of Second Quarter 2015 Results  During second quarter 2015, we achieved the following financial and operating results:      ●  achieved 24% production growth over the same period of 2014;     ●  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil decreased 46% from the same period of 2014 with a 56% decline in average sales prices somewhat offset by our increase in production volumes;     ●  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives declined 15% from the same period of 2014;     ●  continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania by growing production, proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage;      ●  reduced direct operating expenses per mcfe by 20% from the same period of 2014;     ●  reduced our depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) rate per mcfe by 8% from the same period of 2014;      ●  issued $750.0 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2025;     ●  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2015, 2016 and 2017; and     ●  realized $159.5 million of cash flow from operating activities. Our financial results have been significantly impacted by lower commodity prices. We experienced a decrease in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 38% decrease in realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range) partially offset by 24% higher production volumes when compared to second quarter 2014. Our second quarter 2015 production growth was due to the continued success of our drilling program, particularly in the Marcellus Shale. During second quarter 2015, we recognized a net loss of $118.6 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $171.4 million, or $1.04 per diluted common share, during second quarter 2014. When comparing second quarter 2015 to second quarter 2014, in addition to lower realized prices, we also reported an unfavorable non-cash fair value adjustment on our commodity derivatives (a non-GAAP measure) and lower gains on asset sales. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable non-cash mark-to-market adjustment related to our deferred compensation plan, lower impairment of proved properties and no loss on extinguishment of debt.  Overview of the First Six Months 2015 Results During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we achieved the following financial and operating results:     ●  achieved 25% production growth from the same period of 2014;     ●  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil decreased 44% from the same period of 2014 with a 55% decline in average sale prices somewhat offset by our increase in production volumes;     ●  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives declined 12% from the same period of 2014;     ●  reduced direct operating expense per mcfe by 24% from the same period of 2014;     ●  reduced our DD&A rate by 9% from the same period of 2014;     ●  issued $750.0 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2025;     ●  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2015, 2016 and 2017; and     ●  realized $370.1 million of cash flow from operating activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recognized a net loss of $90.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share compared to net income of $203.9 million or $1.24 per diluted common share in the same period of 2014. In the first six months 2015, we experienced a decrease in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 35% decrease in realized prices partially offset by 25% higher production volumes. When comparing the first six months 2015 to the same period of 2014, in addition to lower realized prices, we also reported an unfavorable non-cash fair value adjustment on our commodity derivatives (a non-GAAP measure), lower gains on asset sales, additional termination costs and unfavorable brokered gas and marketing margins which includes higher operating costs on our company-owned gathering lines. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable non-cash mark-to-market adjustment related to our deferred compensation plan, lower impairment of proved properties and no loss on extinguishment of debt.  One of our primary focuses in 2015 has been to reduce costs throughout the organization, through a number of internal initiatives. For example, we announced in early 2015 we were closing our Oklahoma City administrative and operational office to  24  reduce our general and administrative expenses. In addition, we have also made personnel reductions in Pennsylvania to reduce lease operating expenses. In light of recent declines in commodity prices, our goal is to continue to reduce costs on a per mcfe basis where possible. We believe natural gas, NGLs and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, worldwide geopolitical events, new technology, the timing of infrastructure build out and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for the remainder of 2015 and for 2016 and 2017, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices that we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future.  Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Revenues from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales include netback arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation costs incurred by the purchaser. In this instance, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. Revenues are also realized from sales arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at a specific delivery point and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation cost deductions. Third party transportation costs we incur to move our commodity to the delivery point are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense. Cash settlements and changes in the market value of derivative contracts are included in derivative fair value income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Effective March 1, 2013, we elected to de-designate all commodity contracts that were previously designated as cash flow hedges and elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.  In second quarter 2015, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales decreased 46% compared to second quarter 2014 with a 56% decrease in average realized prices partially offset by a 24% increase in production. In the six months ended June 30, 2015, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales decreased 44% compared to the same period in 2014 with a 55% decrease in average realized prices partially offset by a 25% increase in production. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, oil and condensate sales for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change        %       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                                                                     Gas   $  171,664        $  275,726        $  (104,062  )     (38  %)     $  400,404     $  621,952     $  (221,548  )     (36  %)    Gas hedges realized (a)     ¾           3,626           (3,626  )     (100  %)        ¾        4,794        (4,794  )     (100  %)    Total gas revenue  $  171,664        $  279,352        $  (107,688  )     (39  %)     $  400,404     $  626,746     $  (226,342  )     (36  %)    Total NGLs revenue  $  40,945        $  109,998        $  (69,053  )     (63  %)     $  100,756     $  245,502     $  (144,746  )     (59  %)    Oil   $  45,444        $  86,881        $  (41,437  )     (48  %)     $  82,376     $  175,002     $  (92,626  )     (53  %)    Oil hedges realized (a)     ¾           1,286           (1,286  )     (100  %)        ¾        2,284        (2,284  )     (100  %)    Total oil revenue  $  45,444        $  88,167        $  (42,723  )     (48  %)     $  82,376     $  177,286     $  (94,910  )     (54  %)    Combined   $  258,053        $  472,605        $  (214,552  )     (45  %)        583,536        1,042,456        (458,920  )     (44  %)    Combined hedges (a)      ¾           4,912           (4,912  )     (100  %)        ¾        7,078        (7,078  )     (100  %)    Total natural gas,  NGLs and oil sales  $  258,053        $  477,517        $  (219,464  )     (46  %)     $  583,536     $  1,049,534     $  (465,998  )     (44  %)       (a)   Cash settlements related to derivatives that qualified or were historically designated for hedge accounting.  Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production partially offset by the natural production decline of our natural gas and oil wells and asset sales. When compared to the same period of 2014, our second quarter 2015 production volumes increased 32% in our Appalachian region and decreased 39% in our Midcontinent region. Our Midcontinent production volumes were negatively impacted by the Conger Exchange transaction which closed June 2014 and the sale of certain other West Texas properties which closed February 2015. For the first six months 2015, our production volumes increased 32% in our Appalachian region and decreased 36% in our Midcontinent region when compared to the same period of 2014. When compared to the same periods of 2014, our Marcellus production volumes increased 32% for both the second quarter 2015 and the six months ended June 30, 2015. Production volumes from the Marcellus Shale in second quarter 2015 were 106.6 Bcfe. Our production for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 is set forth in the following table:      25         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Production (a)                                                                                  Natural gas (mcf)     87,737,330           67,761,616           19,975,714        29  %         168,237,366        129,779,197        38,458,169     30  %    NGLs (bbls)     5,105,127           4,470,854           634,273        14  %         10,464,403        8,942,335        1,522,068     17  %    Crude oil (bbls)     1,089,417           989,609           99,808        10  %         2,228,377        2,024,754        203,623     10  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     124,904,594           100,524,394           24,380,200        24  %         244,394,046        195,581,731        48,812,315     25  %    Average daily production (a)                                                                                Natural gas (mcf)     964,146           744,633           219,513        29  %         929,488        717,012        212,476     30  %    NGLs (bbls)     56,100           49,130           6,970        14  %         57,814        49,405        8,409     17  %    Crude oil (bbls)     11,972           10,875           1,097        10  %         12,311        11,186        1,125     10  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     1,372,578           1,104,664           267,914        24  %         1,350,243        1,080,562        269,681     25  %       (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.      (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received during second quarter 2015 was $2.31 per mcfe compared to $3.73 per mcfe in second quarter 2014. Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) was $2.54 per mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $3.93 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualified for hedge accounting. Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.  Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials. The price we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments of delivery location, relative quality and other factors. Average natural gas differentials were $0.68 per mcf below NYMEX in second quarter 2015 compared to $0.60 per mcf below NYMEX in second quarter 2014. We also realized gains on our basis hedging in second quarter 2015 of $0.02 per mcf which is comparable to second quarter 2014. Average natural gas differentials were $0.43 per mcf below NYMEX in the first six months 2015 compared to being equal to NYMEX in the same period of 2014 which was due, in part, to extreme cold weather conditions in first quarter 2014. We also realized losses on our basis hedging of $0.04 per mcf in the first six months 2015 compared to a loss of $0.42 per mcf in the first six months 2014. Average realized price calculations for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 are shown below:    26         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015        2014        2015        2014       Average Prices                                                  Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements):                                                 Natural gas (per mcf)  $  1.96        $  4.07        $  2.38        $  4.79       NGLs (per bbl)     8.02           24.60           9.63           27.45       Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     41.71           87.79           36.97           86.43       Total (per mcfe) (a)     2.07           4.70           2.39           5.33       Average realized prices (including derivative settlements that qualified for hedge accounting):                                     Natural gas (per mcf)  $  1.96        $  4.12        $  2.38        $  4.83       NGLs (per bbl)     8.02           24.60           9.63           27.45       Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     41.71           89.09           36.97           87.56       Total (per mcfe) (a)     2.07           4.75           2.39           5.37        Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements):                                     Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.95        $  3.88        $  3.23        $  4.03       NGLs (per bbl)     9.97           24.34           11.12           25.84       Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     67.60           80.63           65.79           81.35       Total (per mcfe) (a)     3.07           4.49           3.30           4.70       Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range):                                     Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.00        $  2.87        $  2.28        $  3.00       NGLs (per bbl)     7.65           22.43           8.75           23.89       Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     67.60           80.63           65.79           81.35       Total (per mcfe) (a)     2.31           3.73           2.54           3.93          (a)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  Derivative fair value (loss) income was a loss of $34.8 million in second quarter 2015 compared to a loss of $24.1 million in second quarter 2014. Derivative fair value (loss) income was income of $88.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to loss of $171.0 million in the same period of 2014. Through February 28, 2013, some of our derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting and were accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions and derivative settlements not accounted for as hedges were included in derivative fair value income or loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Effective March 1, 2013, we discontinued hedge accounting prospectively. Since March 1, 2013, all of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment results in volatility of our revenues as the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions are included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. The following table summarizes the impact of our commodity derivatives for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):           Three Months Ended June 30,           Six Months Ended June 30,          2015           2014           2015           2014       Derivative fair value (loss) income per consolidated statements of operations  $  (34,791  )     $  (24,109  )     $  88,048        $  (170,959  )                                                      Non-cash fair value (loss) gain: (1)                                                 Natural gas derivatives  $  (99,274  )     $  28,435        $  (64,984  )     $  (18,911  )    Oil derivatives     (51,734  )        (27,131  )        (66,620  )        (34,412  )    NGL derivatives     (9,009  )        765           (3,064  )        13,126       Total non-cash fair value (loss) gain (1)  $  (160,017  )     $  2,069        $  (134,668  )     $  (40,197  )                                                      Net cash receipt (payment) on derivative settlements:                                                 Natural gas derivatives  $  87,059        $  (16,637  )     $  142,928        $  (103,745  )    Oil derivatives     28,201           (8,376  )        64,227           (12,580  )    NGL derivatives     9,966           (1,165  )        15,561           (14,437  )    Total net cash receipt (payment)  $  125,226        $  (26,178  )     $  222,716        $  (130,762  )       (1)  Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a non-GAAP measure. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives only represents the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. We believe that non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to differentiate non-cash fair market value adjustments from settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. Non-cash fair  27       value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered a substitute for derivative fair value income or loss as reported in our consolidated statements of operations. Gain (loss) on the sale of assets was a $2.9 million gain in second quarter 2015 compared to a gain of $282.1 million in second quarter 2014. In second quarter 2015, we sold miscellaneous unproved property and inventory for proceeds of $3.6 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $2.9 million. In second quarter 2014, we recognized a gain related to the Conger Exchange of $280.1 million after selling expenses and received proceeds of $145.0 million. Gain on the sale of assets was $2.7 million in the first six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to a $281.7 million gain in the same period of 2014. The first six months 2015 includes the sale of miscellaneous unproved and proved properties and inventory for cash proceeds of $14.3 million. Included in the $14.3 million of proceeds is $10.5 million received from the sale of certain West Texas properties. In the first six months 2014, in addition to the Conger Exchange, we sold miscellaneous proved and unproved oil and gas properties for proceeds of $1.1 million and recognized an additional gain of $1.6 million. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in second quarter 2015 was $21.3 million compared to $30.1 million in second quarter of 2014 with higher volumes offset by significantly lower average sales prices. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenues in the first six months 2015 was $35.8 million compared to $62.6 million in the same period of 2014 with higher volumes offset by significantly lower average sales prices. The three months and the six months ended June 30, 2014 also included revenue of $2.7 million from the sale of excess transportation capacity. Operating Costs Per mcfe. We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:        Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Direct operating expense  $  0.28        $  0.35        $  (0.07  )     (20  %)     $  0.29     $  0.38     $  (0.09  )  (24  %)    Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.07           0.11           (0.04  )     (36  %)         0.08        0.12        (0.04  )  (33  %)    General and administrative expense     0.45           0.57           (0.12  )     (21  %)         0.43        0.54        (0.11  )  (20  %)    Interest expense     0.35           0.45           (0.10  )     (22  %)         0.34        0.46        (0.12  )  (26  %)    Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     1.22           1.33           (0.11  )     (8  %)         1.22        1.34        (0.12  )  (9  %)   Direct operating expense was $34.8 million in second quarter 2015 compared to $34.9 million in second quarter 2014. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Our production volumes increased 24% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for second quarter 2015 was the same as the prior year quarter, with an increase in the number of producing wells and higher water handling and disposal costs offset by lower workover costs, lower well service costs, lower personnel and stock-based compensation costs and the sale of certain non-core assets in the second quarter 2014. We incurred $1.4 million of workover costs in second quarter 2015 compared to $1.9 million in second quarter 2014.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in second quarter 2015 decreased 20% from the same period of 2014 with the decrease consisting of lower well service costs, lower non-recurring well workovers, lower personnel and stock-based compensation partially offset by higher water handling and disposal costs. We expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas. Direct operating expense was $71.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $74.7 million in the same period of 2014. Our production volumes increased 25% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses decreased 4% with an increase in the number of producing wells and higher water handling and disposal costs more than offset by lower workover costs, lower well service costs, lower field personnel and stock-based compensation costs and the sale of certain non-core assets in the second quarter 2014. We incurred $2.5 million of workover costs in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $7.4 million in the same period of 2014.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased 24% to $0.29 from $0.38 in the same period of 2014, with the decrease consisting of lower well service costs, lower field personnel costs and lower workover costs somewhat offset by higher water handling and disposal costs. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of the compensation of field employees.  28  The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:        Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Lease operating expense  $  0.26        $  0.31        $  (0.05  )     (16  %)     $  0.27     $  0.33     $  (0.06  )  (18  %)    Workovers     0.01           0.02           (0.01  )     (50  %)         0.01        0.04        (0.03  )  (75  %)    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.01           0.02           (0.01  )     (50  %)         0.01        0.01        ¾     ¾  %    Total direct operating expense  $  0.28        $  0.35        $  (0.07  )     (20  %)      $  0.29     $  0.38     $  (0.09  )  (24  %)   Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $2.8 million in second quarter 2015 compared to $4.3 million in second quarter 2014. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $0.02 in second quarter 2015 compared to $0.04 in first quarter 2014 due to an increase in volumes not subject to production or ad valorem taxes and lower prices. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” which functions as a tax on unconventional natural gas and oil production from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Included in second quarter 2015 is a $6.5 million impact fee ($0.05 per mcfe) compared to $6.5 million ($0.07 per mcfe) in second quarter 2014.  Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) was $6.6 million ($0.03 per mcfe) in the first six months 2015 compared to $9.5 million ($0.05 per mcfe) in the same period of 2014 due to lower prices and an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes. Included in the first six months 2015 is a $12.6 million ($0.05 per mcfe) impact fee compared to $13.0 million ($0.07 per mcfe) in the same period of 2014. General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $56.0 million in second quarter 2015 compared to $56.9 million for second quarter 2014. The second quarter 2015 decrease of $924,000 when compared to the same period of 2014 is primarily due to lower salaries and benefits, lower stock-based compensation expense which is partially offset by higher legal expenses and higher franchise taxes. The second quarter 2014 stock-based compensation includes awards granted to our prior Executive Chairman for his service in 2013 while he was a Range officer, which were fully vested upon grant. At June 30, 2015, the number of general and administrative employees has remained the same when compared to June 30, 2014. G&A expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased $1.8 million when compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower stock-based compensation and lower public relations costs partially offset by higher salaries and benefits, higher legal costs and higher franchise taxes. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and performance shares granted to our employees and non-employee directors as part of compensation. On a per mcfe basis, second quarter 2015 G&A expense decreased 21% from second quarter 2014 and 20% from the six months ended 2014. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       General and administrative  $  0.32        $  0.36        $  (0.04  )     (11  %)     $  0.32     $  0.37     $  (0.05  )  (14  %)    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.13           0.21           (0.08  )     (38  %)        0.11        0.17        (0.06  )  (35  %)    Total general and administrative expense  $  0.45        $  0.57        $  (0.12  )     (21  %)     $  0.43     $  0.54     $  (0.11  )  (20  %)   Interest expense was $43.5 million for second quarter 2015 compared to $45.5 million for second quarter 2014 and was $82.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $90.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014. The following table presents information about interest expense per mcfe for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Bank credit facility  $  0.03        $  0.04        $  (0.01  )     (25  %)     $  0.04     $  0.04     $  ¾     ¾  %    Senior notes     0.04           ¾           0.04        ¾  %        0.02        ¾        0.02     ¾  %    Subordinated notes     0.26           0.38           (0.12  )     (32  %)         0.27        0.39        (0.12  )  (31  %)    Amortization of deferred financing costs and other     0.02           0.03           (0.01  )     (33  %)        0.01        0.03        (0.02  )  (67  %)    Total interest expense  $  0.35        $  0.45        $  (0.10  )     (22  %)      $  0.34     $  0.46     $  (0.12  )  (26  %)   29  On an absolute basis, the decrease in interest expense for second quarter 2015 from the same period of 2014 was primarily due to lower average interest rates on our total outstanding debt. In May 2015 we issued $750.0 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2025. In June 2014, we redeemed all of our $300.0 million 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for second quarter 2015 was $682.8 million compared to $657.2 million in second quarter 2014 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 1.7% in second quarter 2015 compared to 2.1% in second quarter 2014.  On an absolute basis, the decrease in interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 from the same period of 2014 was primarily due to lower average interest rates on our total outstanding debt. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $780.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $634.5 million for the same period of 2014 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 1.7% in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to 2.1% in the same period of 2014. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) expense was $151.9 million in second quarter 2015 compared to $133.4 million in second quarter 2014. This increase is due to a 9% decrease in depletion rates more than offset by a 24% increase in production. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $1.15 per mcfe in second quarter 2015 compared to $1.26 per mcfe in first quarter 2014. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to drilling success and continued capital efficiencies in the Marcellus Shale.  DD&A expense was $299.2 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $262.0 million in the same period of 2014. Depletion expense was $1.16 per mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.27 per mcfe in the same period of 2014. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014:        Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Depletion and amortization  $  1.15        $  1.26        $  (0.11  )     (9  %)     $  1.16     $  1.27     $  (0.11  )  (9  %)    Depreciation     0.03           0.03           ¾        ¾  %        0.02        0.03        (0.01  )  (33  %)    Accretion and other     0.04           0.04           ¾        ¾  %         0.04        0.04        ¾     ¾  %    Total DD&A expense  $  1.22        $  1.33        $  (0.11  )     (8  %)      $  1.22     $  1.34     $  (0.12  )  (9  %)   Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $95.2 million in second quarter 2015 compared to $76.8 million in second quarter 2014. Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $184.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $151.0 million in the same period of 2014. These third party costs are higher than 2014 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering, compression and transportation agreements. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range). Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, deferred compensation plan expenses and termination costs. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants, PSUs and SARs grants. The following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation to functional expense categories for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):         Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2015        2014        2015     2014       Direct operating expense  $  654        $  1,937        $  1,540     $  2,789       Brokered natural gas and marketing expense     619           1,130           1,125        1,658       Exploration expense     751           1,222           1,483        2,375       General and administrative expense     15,953           20,696           27,033        32,300       Termination costs     434           ¾           1,721        ¾       Total stock-based compensation  $  18,411        $  24,985        $  32,902     $  39,122      Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $27.0 million in second quarter 2015 compared to $34.8 million in second quarter 2014. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $48.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $68.9 million in the same period of 2014. These costs were lower in second quarter 2015 when compared to second quarter 2014 with  30  higher brokered gas volumes more than offset by lower purchase prices and higher expenses related to company-owned gathering lines we received as part of the Conger Exchange of $4.8 million. These cost were lower in the six months ended June 30, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014 with higher brokered gas volumes more than offset by significantly lower purchase prices and higher expenses related to company-owned gathering lines of $9.3 million. The three months and the six months ended June 30, 2015 included $5.3 million of transportation capacity charges where we had taken firm capacity ahead of our production volumes. Exploration expense was $5.0 million in second quarter 2015 compared to $13.6 million in second quarter 2014 due to lower seismic costs and personnel and stock-based compensation. Exploration expense was $12.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $28.5 million in the same period of 2014. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Seismic  $  151        $  6,966        $  (6,815  )     (98  %)     $  1,575     $  12,211     $  (10,636  )  (87  %)    Delay rentals and other     1,026           1,460           (434  )     (30  %)         2,758        5,554        (2,796  )  (50  %)    Personnel expense     3,094           3,973           (879  )     (22  %)         6,989        8,326        (1,337  )  (16  %)    Stock-based compensation expense     751           1,222           (471  )     (39  %)         1,483        2,375        (892  )  (38  %)    Dry hole expense     3           ¾           3        ¾  %        106        1        105     ¾  %    Total exploration expense  $  5,025        $  13,621        $  (8,596  )     (63  %)     $  12,911     $  28,467     $  (15,556  )  (55  %)   Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $12.3 million in second quarter 2015 compared to $9.3 million in second quarter 2014. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $23.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $19.3 million in the same period of 2014. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments will likely be recorded. The increase in second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015 when compared to the same periods of 2014 is primarily due to higher expected forfeitures in the Midcontinent. Termination costs were $417,000 in second quarter 2015 and $6.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. These costs include $3.2 million of accrued building lease costs for our Oklahoma City office, additional severance and stock-based compensation for accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants for both our Oklahoma City office employees and other areas where we have determined a need to reduce personnel due, in part, to the low commodity price environment. Deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of $7.3 million in second quarter 2015 compared to a loss of $10.5 million in second quarter 2014. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price decreased from $52.04 at March 31, 2015 to $49.38 at June 30, 2015. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price increased from $82.97 at March 31, 2014 to $86.95 at June 30, 2014. During the six months ended June 30, 2015 deferred compensation was a gain of $12.9 million compared to a loss of $8.5 million in the same period of 2014. Our stock price decreased from $53.45 at December 31, 2014 to $49.38 at June 30, 2015. In the same period of 2014, our stock price increased from $84.31 at December 31, 2013 to $86.95 at June 30, 2014.  Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the second quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $24.6 million. In June 2014, we redeemed our 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019 at 104.0% of par and we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $24.6 million which includes a call premium and expensing of related deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt. Impairment of proved properties was $25.0 million in the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2014. Impairment expense was recorded related to certain of our natural gas and oil properties in Mississippi, West Texas and North Texas. 31  Income tax (benefit) expense was a benefit of $62.0 million in second quarter 2015 compared to income tax expense of $118.0 million in second quarter 2014. For the second quarter, the effective tax rate was 34.3% in 2015 compared to 40.8% in 2014. Income tax benefit was $39.6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to income tax expense of $136.9 million in the same period of 2014. For the six months ended June 30, 2015 the effective tax rate was 30.3% compared to 40.2% in the six months ended June 30, 2014. The 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, permanent differences, changes in our valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets associated with senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation, which includes distributions from the deferred compensation plan, is expected to exceed the $1.0 million annual deductible limit provided under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and changes to our valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carry forwards. In both the second quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2015, we have increased our valuation allowances for state net operating loss carryforwards and credits. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39% for the remainder of 2015, before any discrete tax items. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and since our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of June 30, 2015, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 197.4 Bcfe for the remainder of 2015, 260.2 Bcfe for 2016 and 7.3 Bcfe for 2017. We have also entered into basis hedges for 50,565,000 Mmbtu through March 2017. Net cash provided from operations in first six months 2015 was $370.1 million compared to $441.5 million in first six months 2014. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities from 2014 to 2015 reflects a 25% increase in production and lower operating costs more than offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 35%). As of June 30, 2015, we have hedged approximately 80% of our projected total production for the remainder of 2015, with approximately 87% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first six months 2015 was positive $22.5 million compared to negative $45.2 million for first six months 2014.  Net cash used in investing activities from operations in first six months 2015 was $704.9 million compared to $512.6 million in the same period of 2014.  During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we:      ●  spent $671.2 million on natural gas and oil property additions;      ●  spent $51.4 million on acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and      ●  received proceeds from asset sales of $14.3 million.  During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we:      ●  spent $546.4 million on natural gas and oil property additions;      ●  spent $110.5 million on acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and      ●  received proceeds from asset sales of $146.1 million.  Net cash provided from financing activities in first six months 2015 was $334.8 million compared to $71.0 million in the same period of 2014. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through debt and equity offerings.  During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we:      ●  borrowed $1.0 billion and repaid $1.4 billion under our bank credit facility, ending the quarter with a $364.0 million outstanding balance on our bank debt;  32      ●  received proceeds of $750.0 million from issuance of 4.875% senior notes due 2025; and     ●  paid dividends of $13.5 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we:      ●  borrowed $1.2 billion and repaid $1.2 billion under our bank credit facility, ending the quarter with $480.0 million of outstanding balance on our bank debt;      ●  redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019, including related expenses;     ●  received proceeds of $396.7 million from the issuance of 4.56 million shares of common stock; and     ●  paid dividends of $13.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first six months 2015, we significantly reduced our operating costs per unit of production and we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2015, 2016 and 2017 to protect future cash flows. On March 31, 2015, our borrowing base and credit facility commitment were reaffirmed for the period from May 1, 2015 to May 1, 2016 along with various changes to certain financial covenants. During the first six months 2015, our net cash provided from operating activities of $370.1 million, proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes and proceeds from asset sales were used to fund approximately $724.2 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At June 30, 2015, we had $521,000 in cash and total assets of $8.8 billion.  Long-term debt at June 30, 2015 totaled $3.5 billion, including $364.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility, $750.0 million of senior notes and $2.4 billion of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at June 30, 2015 was $1.5 billion. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A further material decline in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and operate profitably. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year, taking into account various factors including the commodity price environment. Our 2015 capital budget is approximately $870.0 million. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Credit Arrangements  As of June 30, 2015, we maintained a revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of $2.0 billion, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility, during a non-investment grade period, is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of October 16, 2019. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. Availability under the bank credit facility, during an investment grade period, is limited to aggregate lender commitments. As of June 30, 2015, the outstanding balance under our credit facility was $364.0 million. Additionally, we had $108.7 million of undrawn letters of credit leaving $1.5 billion of committed borrowing capacity available under the facility.  33  Our bank credit facility and our senior subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under our bank credit facility and the agreements relating to our subordinated notes). These agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, investments and financial ratios. We are in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2015. See Note 8 for additional information regarding our bank debt. Cash Dividend Payments  On June 1, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.8 million) on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on June 30, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2015. The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors. Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation and gathering commitments. As of June 30, 2015, we do not have any capital leases. As of June 30, 2015, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of June 30, 2015, we had a total of $108.7 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2014, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $359.0 million decrease in our outstanding bank credit facility balance, issuance of $750.0 million of 4.875% senior notes, new firm transportation contracts and new delivery commitments. The new firm transportation contracts increased our contractual obligations by approximately $71.5 million over the next nine years.  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives, as we typically utilize commodity swap and collar contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our on-going development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. The fair value of these contracts which is represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination is based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX for natural gas and oil or Mont Belvieu for NGLs, approximated a pretax gain of $262.8 million at June 30, 2015. The contracts expire monthly through December 2017. At June 30, 2015, the following commodity-based derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed separately below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price                           Natural Gas                      2015     Collars     145,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.07–$ 4.56    2015     Swaps     737,500 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.63    2016     Swaps     630,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.42    2017     Swaps     20,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.49                           Crude Oil                      2015     Swaps     11,250 bbls/day     $ 85.87    2016     Swaps     3,000 bbls/day     $ 70.54      NGLs (C3-Propane)                      2015     Swaps     13,000 bbls/day     $ 0.58/gallon    2016     Swaps     5,500 bbls/day     $ 0.60/gallon      NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                      2015     Swaps     3,500 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon    2016     Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon      NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                      2015     Swaps     4,000 bbls/day     $ 1.16/gallon    2016     Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 1.23/gallon   34  In addition to the collars and swaps discussed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we received for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a gain of $5.9 million at June 30, 2015, the volumes are for 50,565,000 Mmbtu and they expire through March 2017. Interest Rates  At June 30, 2015, we had approximately $3.5 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $3.1 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.4%. Bank debt totaling $364.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 1.5% at June 30, 2015. The 30-day LIBO Rate on June 30, 2015 was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on June 30, 2015 would cost us approximately $3.6 million in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any significant off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2015 to continue to be a function of supply and demand and we believe, based on the lower commodity price environment, we will continue to see cost reductions. However, the timing and amount of such cost reductions cannot be predicted.        ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Natural gas and NGLs prices affect us more than oil prices because approximately 97% of our December 31, 2014 proved reserves are natural gas and NGLs. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015.  35  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. At June 30, 2015, our derivative program includes swaps and collars. These contracts expire monthly through December 2017. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of June 30, 2015, approximated a net unrealized pretax gain of $262.8 million. At June 30, 2015, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price     Fair MarketValue                               (in thousands)       Natural Gas                                  2015     Collars     145,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.07–$ 4.56     $  31,149       2015     Swaps     737,500 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.63     $  98,729       2016     Swaps     630,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.42     $  56,235       2017     Swaps     20,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.49     $  930                                          Crude Oil                                  2015     Swaps     11,250 bbls/day     $ 85.87     $  52,720       2016     Swaps     3,000 bbls/day     $ 70.54     $  9,239                                          NGLs (C3-Propane)                                  2015     Swaps     13,000 bbls/day     $ 0.58/gallon     $  9,732       2016     Swaps     5,500 bbls/day     $ 0.60/gallon     $  4,234                                          NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                                  2015     Swaps     3,500 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon     $  2,057       2016     Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon     $  712                                          NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                                  2015     Swaps     4,000 bbls/day     $ 1.16/gallon     $  (2,223  )    2016     Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 1.23/gallon     $  (678  )   We expect our NGLs production to continue to increase. In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGLs production and we believe NGLs prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional and global markets. If we are not able to sell or store propane, we may be required to curtail production or shift our drilling activities to dry gas areas. Currently, there is little demand, or facilities to supply the existing demand elsewhere, for ethane in the Appalachian region. We have previously announced five ethane agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. The Mariner East agreement is expected to begin ethane operations in the second half of 2015. We cannot assure you that this facility will become available. The remaining two contract start dates are still in the planning or construction stage. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these five agreements, we may be required to curtail production or, as we have in the past, purchase natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. In addition to the collars and swaps discussed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors. Therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a gain of $5.9 million at June 30, 2015 and they expire monthly through March 2017. 36  The following table shows the fair value of our collars, swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at June 30, 2015. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value                         Increase of        Decrease of             Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%       Collars     $  31,149        $  (7,404  )     $  (18,059  )     $  7,565        $  19,113       Swaps        231,687           (156,212  )        (388,718  )        156,317           390,786       Basis swaps        5,860           2,163           15,228           (15,492  )        (28,751  )   Our commodity-based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At June 30, 2015, our derivative counterparties include seventeen financial institutions, of which all but two are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior and senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At June 30, 2015, we had $3.5 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $3.1 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.4%. Bank debt totaling $364.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 1.5% on June 30, 2015. On June 30, 2015, the 30-day LIBO Rate was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on June 30, 2015, would cost us approximately $3.6 million in additional annual interest expense.        ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2015 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        37  PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 15 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part I Item 1 above for a summary of our legal proceedings, such information being incorporated herein by reference.  Environmental Proceedings Our subsidiary, Range Resources – Appalachia, LLC, was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”) that it intends to assess a civil penalty under the Clean Streams Law and the 2012 Oil and Gas Act in connection with one well in Lycoming County. The DEP has directed us to prevent methane and other substances from escaping from this gas well and polluting groundwater and a stream. We have considerable evidence that this well is not leaking and pre-drill testing of surrounding water wells showed the presence of methane in the water before commencement of our operations. While we intend to vigorously assert this position with the DEP; resolution of this matter may nonetheless result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.     ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.
