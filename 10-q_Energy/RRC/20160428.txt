Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2016.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties primarily in the Appalachian region of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area-by-area basis. Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. Natural gas and crude oil prices continue to be depressed. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect:        ●  revenues, profitability and cash flow;        ●  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce;         ●  the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures; and        ●  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Market Conditions Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for these commodities are inherently volatile. Since year-end 2015, prices have remained under pressure given the current oversupply of such commodities. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGL composite price for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:         Three Months Ended March 31,          2016           2015           Change           % Change       Average NYMEX prices (a)                                                 Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.09        $  2.98        $  (0.89  )        (30  %)    Oil (per bbl)     33.56           48.62           (15.06  )        (31  %)    Mont Belvieu NGLs composite (per gallon) (b)     0.32           0.43           (0.11  )        (26  %)          (a)  Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.

Our financial results have been significantly impacted by lower commodity prices. We experienced a decrease in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 45% decrease in realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by us) partially offset by 5% higher production volumes when compared to first quarter 2015. During first quarter 2016, we recognized a net loss of $91.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $27.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted common share, during first quarter 2015.  Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Both types include transportation charges. One type of agreement is a netback agreement, under which we sell natural gas or oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation costs incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. In the case of NGLs, we generally receive a net price from the purchaser (which is net of processing costs) which is also recorded as revenue at the net price we receive from the purchaser. Under the other type of agreement, we sell natural gas or oil at a specific delivery point, pay transportation to a third party and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation cost deduction. In that case, we record transportation costs we pay to third parties as transportation, gathering and compression expense.  In first quarter 2016, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales decreased 36% compared to first quarter 2015 with a 39% decrease in average realized prices partially offset by a 5% increase in production. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, oil and condensate sales for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2016        2015        Change        %       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                              Gas   $  142,435        $  228,740        $  (86,305  )     (38  %)    NGLs     50,162           59,811           (9,649  )     (16  %)    Oil      16,890           36,932           (20,042  )     (54  %)    Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales  $  209,487        $  325,483        $  (115,996  )     (36  %)   22    Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production but is partially offset by the natural production decline of our natural gas and oil wells and asset sales. When compared to the same period of 2015, our first quarter 2016 production volumes increased 8% in our Appalachian region, despite the sale of our Virginia and West Virginia properties at the end of 2015. Production volumes from the Marcellus Shale in first quarter 2016 were 1.3 Bcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2015, our Marcellus production volumes increased 19% for first quarter 2016. Our production for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 is set forth in the following table:         Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2016        2015        Change        %       Production (a)                                              Natural gas (mcf)     84,867,370           80,500,036           4,367,334        5  %     NGLs (bbls)     5,974,734           5,359,276           615,458        11  %     Crude oil (bbls)     844,341           1,138,960           (294,619  )     (26  %)     Total (mcfe) (b)     125,781,820           119,489,452           6,292,368        5  %     Average daily production (a)                                            Natural gas (mcf)     932,608           894,445           38,163        4  %     NGLs (bbls)     65,656           59,548           6,108        10  %     Crude oil (bbls)     9,278           12,655           (3,377  )     (27  %)     Total (mcfe) (b)     1,382,218           1,327,661           54,557        4  %        (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.      (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) during first quarter 2016 was $1.54 per mcfe compared to $2.79 per mcfe in first quarter 2015. Although we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.  Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials. The price we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location, relative quality and other factors. Average natural gas differentials were $0.41 per mcf below NYMEX in first quarter 2016 compared to $0.14 per mcf below NYMEX in first quarter 2015. We also realized gains on our basis hedging in first quarter 2016 of $0.10 per mcf compared to a realized loss of $0.10 per mcf in first quarter 2015. Average realized price calculations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 are shown below:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2016        2015        Change        %       Average Prices                                              Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements):                                              Natural gas (per mcf)  $  1.68        $  2.84        $  (1.16  )     (41  %)    NGLs (per bbl)     8.40           11.16           (2.76  )     (25  %)    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     20.00           32.43           (12.43  )     (38  %)    Total (per mcfe) (a)     1.67           2.72           (1.05  )     (39  %)    Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements):                                              Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.69        $  3.54        $  (0.85  )     (24  %)    NGLs (per bbl)     10.22           12.20           (1.98  )     (16  %)    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     35.49           64.06           (28.57  )     (45  %)    Total (per mcfe) (a)     2.54           3.54           (1.00  )     (28  %)    Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range):                                              Natural gas (per mcf)  $  1.59        $  2.58        $  (0.99  )     (38  %)    NGLs (per bbl)     4.75           9.80           (5.05  )     (52  %)    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     35.49           64.06           (28.57  )     (45  %)    Total (per mcfe) (a)     1.54           2.79           (1.25  )     (45  %)   23        (a)  Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.   Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $125.3 million in first quarter 2016 compared to $89.4 million in first quarter 2015. These third party costs are higher than 2015 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering, compression and transportation agreements. In addition, first quarter 2016 includes additional expenses related the commencement of a new NGL pipeline project where we are able to export both ethane and propane internationally. Also included are additional ethane pipeline capacity charges for ethane transportation to the Gulf Coast. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range). Derivative fair value income was $86.9 million in first quarter 2016 compared to $122.8 million in first quarter 2015. All of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment can result in more volatility of our revenues as the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions is included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. The following table summarizes the impact of our commodity derivatives for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):           Three Months Ended March 31,          2016           2015       Derivative fair value income per consolidated statements of operations  $  86,908        $  122,839                                 Non-cash fair value gain (loss): (1)                         Natural gas derivatives  $  (2,947  )     $  34,290       Oil derivatives     (9,506  )        (14,885  )    NGLs derivatives     (10,094  )        5,944       Freight derivatives     (11  )        –       Total non-cash fair value (loss) gain (1)  $  (22,558  )     $  25,349                                 Net cash receipt on derivative settlements:                         Natural gas derivatives  $  85,515        $  55,869       Oil derivatives     13,073           36,026       NGLs derivatives     10,878           5,595       Total net cash receipt  $  109,466        $  97,490             (1)  Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a non-GAAP measure. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives only represent the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. We believe that non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to differentiate non-cash fair market value adjustments from settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered a substitute for derivative fair value income or loss as reported in our consolidated statements of operations. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in first quarter 2016 was $35.0 million compared to $14.5 million in first quarter 2015 with significantly higher brokered natural gas volumes offset by lower average sales prices. In first quarter 2016, we also received $3.0 million from the sale of brokered propane volumes compared to none in the same period of the prior year. The first quarter 2015 included $2.1 million of gathering, marketing and broker revenue from our Virginia and West Virginia properties which we sold in fourth quarter 2015. Operating Costs Per mcfe We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:   24           Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2016        2015        Change        %       Direct operating expense  $  0.19        $  0.31        $  (0.12  )     (39  %)       Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.05           0.08           (0.03  )     (38  %)        General and administrative expense     0.32           0.40           (0.08  )     (20  %)        Interest expense     0.30           0.33           (0.03  )     (9  %)        Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     0.96           1.23           (0.27  )     (22  %)       Direct operating expense was $24.1 million in first quarter 2016 compared to $37.1 million in first quarter 2015. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Our production volumes increased 5% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for first quarter 2016 declined 35% from the prior year quarter. Our direct operating costs have declined as a result of our cost reduction efforts and the sale of non-core assets. We have experienced cost decreases in most categories of direct operating expenses including lower well service costs, lower personnel and stock-based compensation expenses and lower utilities. We incurred $1.4 million of workover costs in first quarter 2016 compared to $1.1 million in first quarter 2015.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in first quarter 2016 decreased 39% from the same period of 2015 with the decrease consisting of lower well service costs and lower personnel costs. We expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2016        2015        Change        %       Lease operating expense  $  0.18        $  0.29        $  (0.11  )     (38  %)    Workovers     0.01           0.01           ¾        ¾  %     Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     ¾           0.01           (0.01  )     ¾  %     Total direct operating expense  $  0.19        $  0.31        $  (0.12  )     (39  %)    Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $526,000 in first quarter 2016 compared to $3.8 million in first quarter 2015. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were negligible in first quarter 2016 compared to $0.03 in first quarter 2015 due to an increase in volumes not subject to production or ad valorem taxes and lower prices. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” which functions as a tax on unconventional natural gas and oil production from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Included in first quarter 2016 is a $5.4 million impact fee ($0.04 per mcfe) compared to $6.1 million ($0.05 per mcfe) in first quarter 2015.  General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $40.7 million in first quarter 2016 compared to $48.3 million for first quarter 2015. The first quarter 2016 decrease of $7.6 million when compared to the same period of 2015 is primarily due to lower salaries and benefits, lower public relations costs, lower legal expenses and lower information technology and office expenses. At March 31, 2016, the number of G&A employees declined 17% when compared to March 31, 2015. On a per mcfe basis, first quarter 2016 G&A expense decreased 20% from first quarter 2015. The following table summarizes G&A expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:         Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2016        2015        Change        %       General and administrative  $  0.23        $  0.31        $  (0.08  )     (26  %)    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.09           0.09           ¾        ¾  %    Total general and administrative expense  $  0.32        $  0.40        $  (0.08  )     (20  %)   25    Interest expense was $37.7 million for first quarter 2016 compared to $39.2 million for first quarter 2015.

On an absolute basis, the decrease in interest expense for first quarter 2016 from the same period of 2015 was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances somewhat offset by higher average interest rates. In August 2015, we redeemed all of our $500.0 million 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020. In May 2015, we issued $750.0 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2025. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for first quarter 2016 was $137.6 million compared to $877.8 million in first quarter 2015 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.1% in first quarter 2016 compared to 1.8% in first quarter 2015.  Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) expense was $120.6 million in first quarter 2016 compared to $147.3 million in first quarter 2015. This decrease is due to a 22% decrease in depletion rates somewhat offset by a 5% increase in production rates. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $0.91 per mcfe in first quarter 2016 compared to $1.16 per mcfe in first quarter 2015. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to the mix of our production from our properties with lower depletion rates, impairment of properties in 2015 which reduced our carrying values and asset sales. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2016        2015        Change        %       Depletion and amortization  $  0.91        $  1.16        $  (0.25  )     (22  %)    Depreciation     0.02           0.03           (0.01  )     (33  %)    Accretion and other     0.03           0.04           (0.01  )     (25  %)     Total DD&A expense  $  0.96        $  1.23        $  (0.27  )     (22  %)    Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, deferred compensation plan expenses, impairment of proved properties and termination costs. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants, PSUs and SARs grants. The following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation to functional expense categories for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):         Three Months Ended March 31,             2016        2015          Direct operating expense  $  588        $  886          Brokered natural gas and marketing expense     516           506          Exploration expense     690           732          General and administrative expense     11,113           11,080          Termination costs     ¾           1,287          Total stock-based compensation  $  12,907        $  14,491         26    Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $36.6 million in first quarter 2016 compared to $21.6 million in first quarter 2015. The increase reflects significantly higher brokered natural gas volumes and lower expenses related to company owned gathering lines (which were sold in fourth quarter 2015) somewhat offset by lower purchase prices and $3.0 million of brokered propane purchases. Exploration expense was $4.9 million in first quarter 2016 compared to $7.9 million in first quarter 2015 due to lower seismic costs and personnel costs. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2016        2015        Change        %       Seismic  $  151        $  1,424        $  (1,273  )     (89  %)    Delay rentals and other     1,825           1,732           93        5  %     Personnel expense     2,247           3,895           (1,648  )     (42  %)     Stock-based compensation expense     690           732           (42  )     (6  %)     Dry hole expense     ¾           103           (103  )     ¾  %    Total exploration expense  $  4,913        $  7,886        $  (2,973  )     (38  %)   Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $10.6 million in first quarter 2016 compared to $11.5 million in first quarter 2015. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.  Termination costs were $162,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to $6.0 million in the same period of 2015. In first quarter 2016, these costs are additional building lease costs related to the closing of our Oklahoma City office. In the first quarter 2015, these costs included $3.2 million of accrued building lease costs for our Oklahoma City office, additional severance and stock-based compensation or accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants for both our Oklahoma City office employees and other areas where we determined a need to reduce personnel due to the commodity price environment. Deferred compensation plan expense was a loss of $16.1 million in first quarter 2016 compared to a gain of $5.6 million in first quarter 2015. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price increased from $24.61 at December 31, 2015 to $32.38 at March 31, 2016. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price decreased from $53.45 at December 31, 2014 to $52.04 at March 31, 2015. Impairment of proved properties was $43.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2016. We assess our proved natural gas and oil properties whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The cash flows we use to assess proved property impairment includes numerous assumptions including (1) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves (2) results of future drilling activities (3) future commodity prices and (4) increases or decreases in production and capital costs. All inputs are evaluated at each measurement date. In first quarter 2016, impairment expense was recorded related to certain of our oil and gas properties in Oklahoma. Due to falling commodity prices, our analysis of these properties, which included the possibility of a sale of certain of these properties, we determined that undiscounted future cash flows were less than their carrying values.  Loss on the sale of assets was $1.6 million in first quarter 2016 compared to $175,000 in first quarter 2015. In first quarter 2016, we sold our non-operated interest in certain wells and gathering facilities in Northeast Pennsylvania for proceeds of $111.5 million and, after closing adjustments, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $2.1 million related to this sale. In addition, in first quarter 2016, we sold miscellaneous proved properties along with inventory, other assets and surface acreage for proceeds of $1.6 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $443,000. In first quarter 2015, we sold miscellaneous unproved and proved properties along with inventory for proceeds of $10.7 million and recognized a pre-tax loss of $175,000. 27    Income tax (benefit) expense was a benefit of $44.0 million in first quarter 2016 compared to income tax expense of $22.4 million in first quarter 2015. For the first quarter, the effective tax rate was 32.4% in 2016 compared to 44.7% in 2015. In first quarter ended 2016, we increased our valuation allowances for state net operating loss carryforwards we do not believe are realizable, decreased our valuation allowance related for our deferred tax asset related to future deferred compensation plan distributions of our senior executives and recorded additional tax expense related to the tax impact of excess financial accounting compensation expense over the corresponding corporate income tax deduction for equity compensation awards that have fully vested. There is no additional paid-in capital pool available to offset these reduced tax benefits. The 2016 and 2015 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, permanent differences, changes in our valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets associated with senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation, which includes distributions from the deferred compensation plan, is expected to exceed the $1.0 million annual deductible limit provided under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and changes to our valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39% for the remainder of 2016, before any discrete tax items. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and because our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year-to-year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. As of March 31, 2016, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 239.0 Bcfe for the remainder of 2016, 60.4 Bcfe for 2017 and 10.0 Bcfe for 2018. We have also entered into natural gas basis hedges for 52,360,000 Mmbtus through March 2017 and propane spread swaps for 1,675,000 barrels in 2016 and 750,000 barrels in 2017. Net cash provided from operating activities in first quarter 2016 was $87.4 million compared to $210.6 million in first quarter 2015. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities from first quarter 2015 to first quarter 2016 reflects a 5% increase in production and lower operating costs more than offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 45%). As of March 31, 2016, we have hedged more than 65% of our projected total production for the remainder of 2016, with more than 80% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first quarter 2016 were negative $6.3 million compared to positive $16.1 million for first quarter 2015.  Net cash used in investing activities in first three months 2016 was $14.9 million compared to $377.7 million in the same period of 2015.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we:         ●  paid $107.0 million on natural gas and oil property additions, which includes cash payments related to our prior year capital budget;         ●  paid $631,000 on field service assets;        ●  paid $19.5 million on acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and         ●  received proceeds from asset sales of $113.1 million.  During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we:         ●  paid $357.8 million on natural gas and oil property additions;         ●  paid $672,000 on field service assets;        ●  paid $30.1 million on acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and         ●  received proceeds from asset sales of $10.7 million.  28    Net cash (used in) provided from financing activities in first quarter 2016 was a decrease of $72.5 million compared to an increase of $167.1 million in the same period of 2015. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through debt and equity offerings.  During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we:         ●  borrowed $358.0 million and repaid $422.0 million under our bank credit facility, ending the first quarter with a $31.0 million outstanding balance on our bank debt; and        ●  paid dividends of $3.4 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we:         ●  borrowed $542.0 million and repaid $353.0 million under our bank credit facility, ending the first quarter with $912.0 million of outstanding balance on our bank debt; and        ●  paid dividends of $6.8 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first three months 2016, we significantly reduced our operating costs per unit of production and we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 to protect future cash flows. On March 17, 2016, our borrowing base and credit facility commitment were reaffirmed through May 1, 2017. During first quarter 2016, our net cash provided from operating activities of $87.4 million and the proceeds we received from asset sales were used to fund approximately $127.1 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). Cash payments for capital expenditures in the first quarter 2016 include payments for services incurred in the prior year capital budget. At March 31, 2016, we had $529,000 in cash and total assets of $6.7 billion.  Long-term debt at March 31, 2016 totaled $2.6 billion, including $31.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility, $750.0 million of senior notes and $1.9 billion of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at March 31, 2016 was $1.7 billion. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A further material decline in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and operate profitably. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year, taking into account various factors including the commodity price environment. Our 2016 capital budget is $495.0 million. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Credit Arrangements  As of March 31, 2016, we maintained a revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of $2.0 billion, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility, during a non-investment grade period, is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of October 16, 2019. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. Availability under the bank credit facility, during an investment grade period, is limited to aggregate lender commitments. As of March 31, 2016, the outstanding balance under our credit facility was $31.0 million. Additionally, we had $230.8 million of undrawn letters of credit leaving $1.7 billion of committed borrowing capacity available under the facility at the end of first quarter 2016.  29    Our bank credit facility and our senior subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under our bank credit facility and the agreements relating to our subordinated notes). These agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, investments and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2016. See Note 8 for additional information regarding our bank debt. Cash Dividend Payments  On February 23, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of two cents per share ($3.4 million) on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on March 31, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2016. The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors. In February 2016, the Board of Directors approved a reduction of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.02 per share. Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation and gathering commitments. As of March 31, 2016, we do not have any capital leases. As of March 31, 2016, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of March 31, 2016, we had a total of $230.8 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2015, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $64.0 million decrease in our outstanding bank credit facility balance and entry into new firm transportation and gathering contracts and new delivery commitments. The new firm transportation and gathering contracts increased our contractual obligations by approximately $12.7 million over the next nine years.  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives, as we typically utilize commodity swap and collar contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our on-going development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. The fair value of these contracts which is represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination is based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX for natural gas and oil or Mont Belvieu for NGLs, approximated a pretax gain of $262.0 million at March 31, 2016. The contracts expire monthly through December 2018. At March 31, 2016, the following commodity-based derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed separately below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price                           Natural Gas                      2016     Swaps     760,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.22    2017     Swaps     155,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 2.82    2018     Swaps     27,500 Mmbtu/day     $ 2.84                           Crude Oil                      2016     Swaps     5,498 bbls/day     $ 59.74    2017     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day     $ 50.13      NGLs (C3-Propane)                      2016     Swaps     5,500 bbls/day     $ 0.60/gallon      NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                      2016     Swaps     3,750 bbls/day     $ 0.66/gallon      NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                      2016     Swaps     3,417 bbls/day     $ 1.12/gallon    2017     Swaps     750 bbls/day     $ 0.91/gallon   30    In addition to the collars and swaps discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we received for our natural gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a gain of $640,000 at March 31, 2016. The volumes are for 52,360,000 Mmbtu and they expire through March 2017. At March 31, 2016, we also had propane spread swap contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. These contracts settle monthly through December 2017 and include total volume of 1,675,000 barrels in 2016 and 750,000 barrels in 2017. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $2.5 million on March 31, 2016. Interest Rates  At March 31, 2016, we had approximately $2.6 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.6 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 5.1%. Bank debt totaling $31.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 2.4% at March 31, 2016. The 30-day LIBOR Rate on March 31, 2016 was approximately 0.4%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on March 31, 2016 would cost us approximately $310,000 in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any significant off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments, some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2016 to continue to be a function of supply and demand and we believe, based on the lower commodity price environment, we expect to see continued cost reductions. However, the timing and amount of such cost reductions cannot be predicted.        ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Changes in natural gas prices affect us more than changes in oil prices because approximately 63% of our December 31, 2015 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016.  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program can also include collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. At March 31, 2016, our derivative program includes swaps. These contracts expire monthly through December 2018. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of March 31,  31    2016, approximated a net unrealized pretax gain of $262.0 million. At March 31, 2016, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price     Fair MarketValue                               (in thousands)       Natural Gas                                  2016     Swaps     760,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.22     $  208,610       2017     Swaps     155,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 2.82     $  2,613       2018     Swaps     27,500 Mmbtu/day     $ 2.84     $  (233  )                                       Crude Oil                                  2016     Swaps     5,498 bbls/day     $ 59.74     $  27,317       2017     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day     $ 50.13     $  1,875                                          NGLs (C3-Propane)                                  2016     Swaps     5,500 bbls/day     $ 0.60/gallon     $  8,380                                          NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                                  2016     Swaps     3,750 bbls/day     $ 0.66/gallon     $  4,773                                          NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                                  2016     Swaps     3,417 bbls/day     $ 1.12/gallon     $  8,713       2017     Swaps     750 bbls/day     $ 0.91/gallon     $  (88  )   We expect our NGLs production to continue to increase and we believe NGLs prices are somewhat seasonal, particularly for propane. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional and international markets. If we are not able to sell or store NGLs, we may be required to curtail production or shift our drilling activities to dry gas areas. Currently, the Appalachian region has limited local demand and infrastructure to accommodate ethane. We have previously announced three ethane agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. Our Mariner East transportation agreement and our terminal/storage arrangements at Sunoco’s Marcus Hook Industrial Complex facility in Pennsylvania began ethane operations late in first quarter 2016. We cannot assure you that these facilities will remain available. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these agreements, we may be required to curtail production or, as we have in the past, purchase or divert natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. Therefore, in addition to the collars and swaps discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of basis adjustments, relative quality and other factors. Basis swap agreements effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the natural gas basis swaps was a gain of $640,000 at March 31, 2016 and they settle monthly through March 2017. At March 31, 2016, we also had propane basis spread contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. The contracts settle monthly through December 2017 and include a total volume of 1,675,000 barrels in 2016 and 750,000 barrels in 2017. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $2.5 million on March 31, 2016. 32    The following table shows the fair value of our swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical changes in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at March 31, 2016. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value                         Increase of        Decrease of             Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%       Swaps     $  261,961        $  (77,966  )     $  (194,719  )     $  78,058        $  195,140       Basis swaps        3,097           1,218           3,030           (1,214  )        (3,034  )    Freight swap        (11  )        42           104           (42  )        (105  )   Our commodity-based derivative contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified primarily among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At March 31, 2016, our derivative counterparties include nineteen financial institutions, of which all but four are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are primarily major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior and senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At March 31, 2016, we had $2.6 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.6 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.1%. Bank debt totaling $31.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 2.4% on March 31, 2016. On March 31, 2016, the 30-day LIBOR Rate was approximately 0.4%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on March 31, 2016, would cost us approximately $310,000 in additional annual interest expense.      ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2016 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.      33    PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 15 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part I Item 1 above for a summary of our legal proceedings, such information being incorporated herein by reference.  Environmental Proceedings Our subsidiary, Range Resources – Appalachia, LLC, was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”), in the second quarter of 2015, that it intends to assess a civil penalty under the Clean Streams Law and the 2012 Oil and Gas Act in connection with one well in Lycoming County. The DEP has directed us to prevent methane and other substances from escaping from this gas well into groundwater and a stream. We have considerable evidence that this well is not leaking and pre-drill testing of surrounding water wells showed the presence of methane in the water before commencement of our operations. While we intend to vigorously assert this position with the DEP; resolution of this matter may nonetheless result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.     ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.
