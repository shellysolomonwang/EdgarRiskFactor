Item 1A. Risk Factors as filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 filed with the SEC on March 1, 2011.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. These policies and estimates are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: accounting for natural gas, NGL and oil revenue, natural gas and oil properties, stock-based compensation, derivative financial instruments, asset retirement obligations and deferred income taxes.  Market Conditions   Prices for various quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Commodity prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.

Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview   We are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties, mostly in the Appalachia and Southwest regions of the United States. Our objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Our corporate headquarters is located in Fort Worth, Texas.  23    Table of Contents   Discontinued operations consists of our Barnett Shale properties which are reported as discontinued operations as of March 31, 2011. Unless otherwise indicated, the information included herein relates to our continuing operations.   During the first three months of 2011, we achieved the following financial and operating results:       •   recorded our 33rd consecutive quarter of sequential production growth;        •   achieved 26% year-over-year production growth;        •   daily production now exceeds 435.0 mmcfe per day;        •   natural gas, NGL and oil sales increased 21% from first quarter 2010;        •   reduced our DD&A rate 12% from first quarter 2010;        •   year-over-year direct operating expense per mcfe increased 4% while production and ad valorem tax expense per mcfe declined 14% and general and administrative expense per mcfe declined 3%;        •   entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2011, 2012 and 2013; and        •   renewed our bank credit facility, with a borrowing base of $2.0 billion.     Total revenues decreased $110.8 million, or 37% for first quarter 2011 over the same period of 2010. The decrease includes a $39.2 million increase in natural gas, NGL and oil sales offset by a decrease in derivative fair value income (loss) of $83.2 million and a lower gain on sale of assets of $67.8 million. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales vary due to changes in volumes of production sold and realized commodity prices. Realized prices declined from the same period of the prior year, which was more than offset by an increase in production, including a 81% increase in NGL production primarily due to increased liquids-rich production in our Appalachia area. For first quarter 2011, production increased 26% from the same period of the prior year while realized prices (including all derivative settlements) declined 3%. We believe natural gas, NGL and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new regulations, new technology, and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for 2011, 2012 and 2013, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future.  Natural Gas, NGL and Oil Sales Production and Realized Price Calculation   Our natural gas, NGL and oil sales vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and volumes of production sold. Hedges included in natural gas, NGL and oil sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Cash settlements of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in derivative fair value (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the primary components of natural gas, NGL and oil sales for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2011     2010     Change     %       Gas wellhead   $ 106,283     $ 123,270     $ (16,987 )     (14 %)   Gas hedges realized     29,616       1,215       28,401       2,338 %                                 Total gas sales     135,899       124,485       11,414       9 %                                                                     NGL     54,475       28,024       26,451       94 %                                                                     Oil wellhead     36,507       35,164       1,343       4 %   Oil hedges realized     —       —       —       — %                                 Total oil sales     36,507       35,164       1,343       4 %                                                                     Combined wellhead     197,265       186,458       10,807       6 %   Combined hedges realized     29,616       1,215       28,401       2,338 %                                 Total natural gas, NGL and oil sales   $ 226,881     $ 187,673     $ 39,208       21 %                                   24    Table of Contents   Our production continues to grow through continued drilling success as we place new wells into production, partially offset by the natural decline of our wells and asset sales. For first quarter 2011, total production volumes, when compared to the same period of the prior year, increased 40% in our Appalachia area and remained the same in our Southwest area. For first quarter 2011, NGL production increased 81% from the same period of the prior year primarily due to increased liquids-rich gas production in our Appalachia area along with an increase in processing capacity in the region. Our production for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 is shown below:                                              Three Months Ended       March 31,       2011   2010   Change   %     Production(a):                                   Natural gas (mcf)     29,805,523       24,372,167       5,433,356       22 %   NGLs (bbls)     1,131,565       623,474       508,091       81 %   Crude oil (bbls)     436,132       505,101       (68,969 )     (14 %)   Total (mcfe)(b)     39,211,706       31,143,617       8,068,089       26 %                                       Average daily production(a):                                   Natural gas (mcf)     331,172       270,802       60,370       22 %   NGLs (bbls)     12,573       6,927       5,646       81 %   Crude oil (bbls)     4,846       5,612       (766 )     (14 %)   Total (mcfe)(b)     435,686       346,040       89,646       26 %                (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.

Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements) received was $5.75 per mcfe in first quarter 2011 compared to $5.90 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Our average realized price calculation (including all derivative settlements) includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualify for hedge accounting. Average price calculations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 are shown below:                              Three Months Ended       March 31,       2011   2010     Average sales prices (wellhead):                   Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 3.57     $ 5.06     NGLs (per bbl)     48.14       44.95     Crude oil (per bbl)     83.71       69.62     Total (per mcfe)(a)     5.03       5.99                         Average realized price (including derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting):                   Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 4.56     $ 5.11     NGLs (per bbl)     48.14       44.95     Crude oil (per bbl)     83.71       69.62     Total (per mcfe)(a)     5.79       6.02                         Average realized price (including all derivative settlements):                   Natural gas (per mcf)     4.58       4.94     NGLs (per bbl)     48.14       44.95     Crude oil (per bbl)     79.31       69.62     Total (per mcfe)(a)     5.75       5.90                  (a)   NGLs and oil are converted at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.   25    Table of Contents   Derivative fair value income (loss) was a loss of $40.8 million in first quarter 2011 compared to a gain of $42.3 million in the same period of 2010. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Mark-to-market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from non-hedge derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in this statement of operations category, is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting.   The following table presents information about the components of derivative fair value (loss) income for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2011     2010       Hedge ineffectiveness — realized(c)   $ 946     $ (357 )    — unrealized(a)     568       (249 )   Change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting(a)     (40,036 )     46,578     Realized loss on settlements — gas(b)(c)     (394 )     (3,639 )   Realized loss on settlements — oil(b)(c)     (1,918 )     —     Derivative fair value (loss) income   $ (40,834 )   $ 42,333                                  (a)   These amounts are unrealized and are not included in average sales price calculations.     (b)   These amounts represent realized gains and losses on settled derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.     (c)   These settlements are included in average realized price calculations (average realized price including all derivative settlements).    Gain on the sale of assets for first quarter 2011 decreased $67.8 million from the same period of the prior year. For the three months ended March 31, 2010, we recorded a total gain of $67.0 million from the sale of our properties in Ohio and we received proceeds of $300.0 million.   Other income (loss) for first quarter 2011 was income of $1.1 million compared to a loss of $1.6 million in the same period of 2010. First quarter 2011 includes income from equity method investments of $262,000. The first quarter of 2010 includes a loss from equity method investments of $1.6 million.   We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about these expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010:                                              Three Months Ended       March 31,       2011   2010   Change   %     Direct operating expense   $ 0.73     $ 0.70     $ 0.03       4 %   Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.18       0.21       (0.03 )     (14 %)   General and administrative expense     0.87       0.90       (0.03 )     (3 %)   Interest expense     0.63       0.67       (0.04 )     (6 %)   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     1.84       2.08       (0.24 )     (12 %)      Direct operating expense increased $6.9 million in first quarter 2011 to $28.7 million. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties. We incurred $390,000 ($0.01 per mcfe) of workover costs in first quarter 2011 versus $777,000 ($0.02 per mcfe) in 2010. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses for first quarter 2011 increased $0.03, or 4%, from the same period of 2010 with the increase primarily due to higher water hauling and disposal costs ($0.04 per mcfe) and higher equipment rental ($0.02 per mcfe) somewhat offset by the impact of the sale of certain higher operating cost assets during 2010. In the future, we expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating costs relative to our other operating areas. Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010:  26    Table of Contents                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2011     2010     Change     %       Lease operating expense   $ 0.71     $ 0.67     $ 0.04       6 %   Workovers     0.01       0.02       (0.01 )     (50 %)   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.01       0.01       —       — %                                 Total direct operating expenses   $ 0.73     $ 0.70     $ 0.03       4 %                                    Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. For first quarter 2011, these taxes increased $337,000 or 5% from the same period of the prior year due to a decrease in the number of wells receiving high cost tax credits which was partially offset by an increase in production volumes not subject to production taxes and lower prices. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes decreased from $0.21 per mcf in first quarter 2010 to $0.18 per mcfe in 2011.   General and administrative expense for first quarter 2011 increased $5.8 million or 21% from the same period of the prior year due primarily to higher community relations costs ($1.3 million), higher salaries and benefits ($3.0 million), higher legal costs ($1.7 million) and higher office expenses, including information technology somewhat offset by lower bad debt expense ($688,000). Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010:                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2011     2010     Change     %       General and administrative   $ 0.68     $ 0.65     $ 0.03       5 %   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.19       0.25       (0.06 )     (24 %)                                 Total general and administrative expenses   $ 0.87     $ 0.90     $ (0.03 )     (3 %)                                    Interest expense for first quarter 2011 increased $3.8 million from the same period of the prior year due to the refinancing of certain debt from floating to higher fixed rates and higher overall debt balances. In August 2010, we issued $500.0 million of 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020, which added $8.4 million of interest costs in first quarter 2011. The proceeds from the issuance were used to retire our 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013 and to lower our floating interest rate bank debt, which better matches the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and gives us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for first quarter 2011 was $421.1 million compared to $359.6 million for the same period of the prior year and the weighted average interest rate was 2.3% in first quarter 2011 compared to 2.1% in the same period of the prior year.   Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) increased $7.4 million, or 11%, to $72.2 million in first quarter 2011. The increase was due to a 26% increase in production partially offset by a 10% decrease in depletion rates. On a per mcfe basis, DD&A decreased from $2.08 in first quarter 2010 to $1.84 in first quarter 2011. Depletion rates are declining due to our lower finding and development costs and the mix of our production. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010:                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2011     2010     Change     %       Depletion and amortization   $ 1.71     $ 1.89     $ (0.18 )     (10 %)   Depreciation     0.10       0.15       (0.05 )     (33 %)   Accretion and other     0.03       0.04       (0.01 )     (25 %)                                 Total DD&A expense   $ 1.84     $ 2.08     $ (0.24 )     (12 %)                                   27    Table of Contents   Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, termination costs, deferred compensation plan expenses and impairment of proved properties. In the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, stock-based compensation represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and expenses related to SAR grants. In first quarter 2011, stock-based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($310,000), exploration expense ($1.3 million) and general and administrative expense ($7.5 million) for a total of $9.6 million. In first quarter 2010, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($362,000), exploration expense ($1.1 million) and general and administrative expense ($7.8 million) for a total of $9.7 million.   Exploration expense increased $13.0 million in first quarter 2011 with higher seismic costs and higher delay rental expense. The higher delay rental payments, or costs to defer the commencement of drilling, are primarily attributed to our Marcellus Shale operations. The following table details our exploration-related expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2011     2010     Change     %       Dry hole expense   $ 10     $ —     $ 10       — %   Seismic     13,172       7,213       5,959       83 %   Personnel expense     4,026       2,730       1,296       47 %   Stock-based compensation expense     1,329       1,136       193       17 %   Delay rentals and other     8,650       3,060       5,590       183 %                                 Total exploration expense   $ 27,187     $ 14,139     $ 13,048       92 %                                    Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties expense was $16.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to $6.6 million during the same period of 2010. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate an impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. The increase from the prior year is primarily due to increasing expirations in the Marcellus Shale.   Termination costs in the first three months of 2010 includes severance costs of $5.1 million related to the sale of our properties in Ohio and $2.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of SARs and restricted stock as part of the severance agreement for our Ohio personnel.   Deferred compensation plan expense was $30.6 million in first quarter 2011 compared to income of $5.7 million in the same period of the prior year. This non-cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in the deferred compensation plan. Our deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense in the accompanying statements of operations. Our stock price increased from $44.98 at December 31, 2010 to $58.46 at March 31, 2011. During the same period in the prior year, our stock price decreased from $49.85 at December 31, 2009 to $46.87 at March 31, 2010.   Impairment of proved properties in the first three months of 2010 of $6.5 million was recognized due to declining gas prices and is related to a portion of our onshore Gulf Coast properties. Our estimated fair value of producing properties is generally calculated as the discounted present value of future net cash flows. Our estimates of cash flow were based on the latest available proved reserve and production information and management’s estimates of future product prices and costs, based on available information such as forward strip prices, at the time of the impairment.   Income tax (benefit) expense for first quarter 2011 decreased to a benefit of $19.9 million from income tax expense of $49.0 million in first quarter 2010, reflecting a 142% decrease in income from continuing operations before taxes compared to the same period of 2010. First quarter 2011 provided for tax benefit at an effective rate of 37.3% compared to tax expense at an effective rate of 38.7% in the same period of 2010. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40% for the remainder of 2011.  28    Table of Contents  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Conditions   Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with both uncommitted and committed availability, asset sales and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In February 2011, we announced we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Barnett Shale properties along with certain derivative contracts for $900.0 million. The sale is expected to close at the end of April 2011. For additional information, see Notes 4 and 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the first three months of 2011, we also entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2011, 2012 and 2013 to protect future cash flows. On February 18, 2011, we announced we had entered into an amended and restated revolving bank credit facility, which replaced our previous credit facility. At closing, the facility amount was $1.5 billion and the borrowing base was $2.0 billion.   During the three months ended March 31, 2011, our cash provided from operating activities was $140.6 million and we spent $260.0 million on capital expenditures and $24.3 million on proved and unproved property purchases. At March 31, 2011, we had $1.7 million in cash, total assets of $5.6 billion and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 49.8%. Long-term debt at March 31, 2011 totaled $2.2 billion, which included $480.0 million of bank credit facility debt and $1.7 billion of senior subordinated notes. Available committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility at March 31, 2011 was $1.0 billion.   In June 2009, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability, subject to market conditions, to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of registered debt and equity securities.   We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year. Our 2011 capital budget (excluding acquisitions) now stands at $1.38 billion and focuses on projects we believe will generate and lay the foundation for economic, long-term production growth. In the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable.   Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, our long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the natural gas and oil business. Sustained lower prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices, which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.   Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Credit Arrangements   On March 31, 2011, the bank credit facility had a $2.0 billion borrowing base and a $1.5 billion facility amount. The borrowing base represents an amount approved by the bank group that can be borrowed based on our assets, while our $1.5 billion facility amount is the amount we have requested that the banks commit to fund pursuant to the credit agreement. The bank credit facility provides for a borrowing base subject to redeterminations semi-annually each April and October and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. Remaining credit availability was $924.0 million on April 25, 2011. Our bank group is comprised of twenty-seven commercial banks, with no one bank holding more than 7.0% of the bank credit facility. We believe our large number of banks and relatively low hold levels allow for significant lending capacity should we elect to increase our $1.5 billion commitment up to the $2.0 billion borrowing base and also allow for flexibility should there be additional consolidation within the banking sector.  29    Table of Contents   Our bank credit facility and our indentures governing our senior subordinated notes all contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, enter into hedging contracts change the nature of our business or operations, merge or consolidate or make certain investments. In addition, we are required to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) of no greater than 4.25 to 1.0 and a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with these covenants at March 31, 2011. Please see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.  Cash Flow   Cash flows from operating activities primarily are affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operating activities also are impacted by changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our natural gas, NGL and oil production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. However, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future natural gas and oil production for the next 12 to 36 months. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowing under the credit facility. As of March 31, 2011, we have entered into derivative agreements covering 128.5 Bcfe for 2011, 88.5 Bcfe for 2012 and 36.5 Bcfe for 2013.   Net cash provided from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $118.7 million compared to $116.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first three months of 2011 was higher than the same period of the prior year, as higher production from development activity and a $15.0 million equity method investment distribution was more than offset by lower realized prices and higher operating costs. Net cash provided from operating activities is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) in the three months ended March 31, 2011 was a decrease of $10.6 million compared to a increase of $15.9 million in the same period of the prior year.   Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $271.8 million compared to net cash provided from investing activities of $108.1 million in the same period of 2010. During the three months ended March 31, 2011, we:       •   spent $250.8 million on natural gas and oil property additions;        •   spent $24.3 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale;        •   received proceeds of $15.2 million primarily from the sale of a low pressure pipeline; and        •   spent $8.2 million on discontinued operations.     During the three months ended March 31, 2010, we:       •   spent $154.0 million on natural gas and oil property additions;        •   spent $19.8 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale;        •   received proceeds of $301.6 million primarily from the sale of Ohio oil and gas properties; and        •   spent $12.3 million on discontinued operations.     Net cash provided from financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $130.0 million compared to $24.8 million in the same period of 2010. During the three months ended March 31, 2011, we:       •   borrowed $372.8 million and repaid $166.8 million under our bank credit facility, ending the period with a $206.0 million higher bank credit facility balance.         •   spent $12.4 million related to debt issuance costs; and          •   recorded as decrease of $61.0 million in cash overdrafts.     During the three months ended March 31, 2010, we:       •   borrowed $148.0 million and repaid $118.0 million under our bank credit facility, ending the period with a $30.0 million higher bank credit facility balance.    Dividends   On March 1, 2011, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.4 million) on our common stock, which was paid on March 31, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2011.  30    Table of Contents  Capital Requirements and Contractual Cash Obligations   We currently estimate our 2011 capital spending will approximate $1.38 billion (excluding acquisitions) and based on current projections is expected to be funded with internal cash flow, property sales and our bank credit facility. Acreage purchases during the first three months include $14.7 million of purchases in the Marcellus Shale, which were funded with borrowings under our credit facility. For the three months ended March 31, 2011, $294.6 million of our development and exploration spending was funded with internal cash flow and borrowings under our bank credit facility. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting the amount up or down and between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may choose to sell assets, issue subordinated notes or other debt securities, or issue additional shares of stock to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions, extend maturities or repay debt.   Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, transportations commitments and other purchase obligations. Since December 31, 2010, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than our outstanding bank credit facility amount increased to $480.0 million at March 31, 2011 and the credit facility loan maturity was extended to 2016. In addition, we entered into additional transportation agreements in Appalachia which totals approximately $100.0 million over the next seven years.  Other Contingencies   We are involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or consolidated financial position.  Hedging — Natural Gas and Oil Prices   We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. Historically, these contracts consisted of collars and fixed price swaps. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital program. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. In light of current worldwide economic uncertainties, we have employed a strategy to hedge a portion of our production looking out 12 to 36 months from each quarter. At March 31, 2011, we had open swap contracts covering 25.6 Bcf of natural gas at prices averaging $5.00 and $1.5 million barrels of NGLs at an average price of $101.88 per barrel. At March 31, 2011, we had collars covering 195.3 Bcf of natural gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $5.42 and $6.27 per mcf and 0.7 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $70.00 and $80.00 per barrel. At March 31, 2011, we also had sold call options covering 3.2 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $82.66. The fair value of all of our derivative contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination, based on a comparison of contract prices and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on March 31, 2011 was a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $31.5 million. The contracts expire monthly through December 2013. Settled transaction gains and losses for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases in natural gas, NGLs and oil sales in the period the hedged production is sold. In the first three months of 2011, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales included realized hedging gains of $29.6 million compared to gains of $1.2 million in the same period of 2010.   At March 31, 2011, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                  Average   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Hedge Price     Natural Gas               2012    Swaps    70,192 Mmbtu/day    $5.00   2011    Collars    418,236 Mmbtu/day    $5.52-$6.45   2012    Collars    119,641 Mmbtu/day    $5.50-$6.25   2013    Collars    100,000 Mmbtu/day    $5.00-$5.73                   Crude Oil               2012    Collars    2,000 bbls/day    $70.00-$80.00   2011    Call options    5,500 bbls/day    $80.00   2012    Call options    4,700 bbls/day    $85.00                   NGLs               2011    Swaps    2,676 bbls/day    $102.80   2012    Swaps    2,000 bbsl/day    $100.96     31    Table of Contents   Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as a hedge but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas and oil production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value as unrealized derivative gains and losses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts as derivative fair value income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. As of March 31, 2011, derivatives on 56.0 Bcfe no longer qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting.  Interest Rates   At March 31, 2011, we had $2.2 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.7 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Bank debt totaling $480.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which approximated 1.9% at March 31, 2011. The 30-day LIBOR rate on March 31, 2011 was 0.2%.  Inflation and Changes in Prices   Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. During first quarter 2011, we received an average of $3.57 per mcf of gas and $83.71 per barrel of oil before derivative contracts compared to $5.06 per mcf of gas and $69.62 per barrel of oil in the same period of the prior year. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and accelerated through the middle of 2008, commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly. The higher prices led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on capital costs. Due to the decline in commodity prices since then, costs have generally moderated but are increasing in areas with high levels of drilling activity that utilize specialized services for horizontal drilling and completions. We expect costs in 2011 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.  32    Table of Contents     ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposures. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk   Our major market risk is exposure to natural gas, NGL and oil prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Natural gas, NGL and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years.  Commodity Price Risk   We periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our natural gas, oil and NGL production. These arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of natural gas and oil price fluctuations. Some of our derivatives have been swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. We have also entered into call option derivative contracts under which we sold call options in exchange for a premium from the counterparty. Historically, we applied hedge accounting to derivatives utilized to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and oil production. Accordingly, we recorded the change in the fair value of our swap and collar contracts under the balance sheet caption accumulated other comprehensive income and into natural gas, NGLs and oil sales when the forecasted sale of production occurred. Any hedge ineffectiveness associated with contracts qualifying for and designated as a cash flow hedge is reported currently each period in derivative fair value income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, oil and NGL production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value in unrealized derivative gains and losses in our consolidated balance sheets. We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in derivative fair value (loss) income in our consolidated statements of operations. Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Our derivative counterparties include nine financial institutions, all of which are in our bank group. None of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that would require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date.   As of March 31, 2011, we had swaps covering 25.6 Bcf of natural gas and 1.5 million barrels of NGLs, collars covering 195.3 Bcf of natural gas and 0.7 million barrels of oil and oil call options for 3.2 million barrels of oil. These contracts expire monthly through December 2013. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of March 31, 2011, approximated a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $31.5 million.   We expect our NGL production to continue to increase. In the first quarter 2011, we entered into NGL swap contracts for the natural gasoline component of NGLs. In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGL production, we believe NGL prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the percentage of NGL prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand.  33    Table of Contents   At March 31, 2011, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                          Fair Market Value                   as of                   March 31, 2011   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Average Hedge Price   Asset (Liability)                   (in thousands)     Natural Gas                   2012    Swaps    70,192 Mmbtu/day    $5.00    $(1,405)   2011    Collars    418,236 Mmbtu/day    $5.52-$6.45    $116,271   2012    Collars    119,641 Mmbtu/day    $5.50-$6.25    $27,532   2013    Collars    100,000 Mmbtu/day    $5.00-$5.73    $(2,945)                       Crude Oil                   2012    Collars    2,000 bbls/day    $70.00-$80.00    $(20,037)   2011    Call options    5,500 bbls/day    $80.00    $(42,949)   2012    Call options    4,700 bbls/day    $85.00    $(43,152)                       NGLs                   2011    Swaps    2,676 bbls/day    $102.80    $(1,104)   2012    Swaps    2,000 bbls/day    $100.96    $(760)     Other Commodity Risk   We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. We currently have not entered into any basis derivatives.   The following table shows the fair value of our swaps, collars and call options and the hypothetical change in the fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at March 31, 2011 (in thousands):                                                              Hypothetical Change in   Hypothetical Change in               Fair Value   Fair Value               Increase of   Decrease of       Fair Value   10%   25%   10%   25%     Swaps   $ (3,269 )   $ (12,592 )   $ (31,487 )   $ 12,792     $ 32,020     Collars     120,821       (86,266 )     (210,057 )     89,681       229,520     Call options     (86,101 )     (30,695 )     (79,080 )     28,395       62,831        Interest rate risk. At March 31, 2011, we had $2.2 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.7 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Senior bank debt totaling $480.0 million bore interest at floating rates averaging 1.9%. A 1% increase or decrease in short-term interest rates would affect interest expense by approximately $4.8 million per year.     ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is  34    Table of Contents  accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2011 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  35    Table of Contents     PART II — OTHER INFORMATION     ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.  36    Table of Contents     ITEM 6. EXHIBITS
