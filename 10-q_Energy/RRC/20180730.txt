Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and crude oil properties primarily in the Appalachian and North Louisiana regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on a geographical or an area-by-area basis.  Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through returns-focused growth, on a per share debt-adjusted basis, of both reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to increase reserves and production through consistent internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions and divestitures of non-core assets. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire, produce and market natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. The price risk on a portion of our production is mitigated using commodity derivative contracts. However, these derivative contracts are limited in duration. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect:        •  revenues, profitability and cash flow;        •  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce;         •  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil shown as proved reserves;        •  the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures; and        •  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. 28  Market Conditions Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for these commodities are inherently volatile. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGLs composite price for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:           Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2018        2017        Change        %        2018     2017     Change     %       Average NYMEX prices (a)                                                                                  Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.80        $  3.18        $  (0.38  )     (12  %)     $  2.89     $  3.24     $  (0.35  )  (11  %)    Oil (per bbl)     67.89           48.36           19.53        40  %        65.54        50.09        15.45     31  %    Mont Belvieu NGLs composite (per gallon) (b)     0.66           0.49           0.17        35  %        0.64        0.52        0.12     23  %       (a)  Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.     (b)  Based on our estimated NGLs product composition per barrel. Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview of Second Quarter 2018 Results  Our financial results are significantly impacted by commodity prices. For second quarter 2018, we experienced an increase in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 4% increase in net realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by us) and 13% higher production volumes when compared to the same quarter of 2017. Daily production in second quarter 2018 averaged 2.2 Bcfe compared to 1.9 Bcfe in the same period of the prior year with the increase due to our successful Marcellus horizontal drilling program. Average natural gas differentials improved $0.21 per mcf while operating costs were higher.  During second quarter 2018, we recognized a net loss of $79.8 million, or $0.32 per diluted common share compared to net income of $69.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted common share, during second quarter 2017. The decrease in net income for second quarter 2018 from second quarter 2017 is primarily due to lower derivative fair value income or the non-cash fair value adjustments related to our derivatives and higher proved and unproved property impairment charges.  Our second quarter 2018 financial and operating performance included the following results:         •  13% production growth over the same period of 2017;           •  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil increased 31% from the same period of 2017 with a 15% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and an increase in production volumes;           •  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives increased 27% from the same period of 2017;           •  rising forward commodity prices resulted in downward non-cash derivative fair value adjustments of $196.8 million;            •  direct operating expenses per mcfe remained the same compared to the same period of 2017 (see discussion on page 35);           •  reduced general and administrative expense per mcfe 20% from the same period of 2017 (see discussion on page 36);           •  interest expense per mcfe was the same when compared to the same period of 2017;           •  reduced our depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) rate per mcfe by 7% from the same period of 2017;            •  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2018, 2019 and 2020; and           •  realized $174.9 million of cash flow from operating activities, a decrease of $10.5 million from the same period of 2017.    We generated $174.9 million of cash flows from operating activities in second quarter 2018, a decrease of $10.5 million from second quarter 2017, which reflects higher comparative working capital outflows ($52.0 million outflow during second quarter 2018 compared to $6.5 million inflow in second quarter 2017) offset by improvements in realized prices and higher production volumes.  29  Overview of First Six Months 2018 Results For first six months 2018, we experienced an increase in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 7% increase in net realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by us) and 13% higher production volumes when compared to the same period of 2017. Daily production in first six months 2018 averaged 2.2 Bcfe compared to 1.9 Bcfe in the same period of the prior year as a result of drilling and completions in Pennsylvania. Average natural gas differentials improved $0.27 per mcf while operating costs were higher.  During first six months 2018, we recognized net loss of $30.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted common share compared to net income of $239.7 million, or $0.97 per diluted common share during the same period of 2017. The decrease in net income for first six months 2018 from the same period of 2017 is primarily due to lower derivative fair value income or the non-cash fair value adjustments related to our derivatives and higher proved and unproved property impairment charges.  Our first six months financial and operating performance included the following results:         •  13% production growth over the same period of 2017;           •  liquids production represented 32% of total production on an mcfe basis compared to 33% in the same period of 2017;           •  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil increased 27% from the same period of 2017 with a 13% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and an increase in production volumes;           •  revenue realized from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives increased 27% from the same period of 2017;           •  rising forward commodity prices resulted in downward non-cash derivative fair value adjustments of $389.5 million;           •  increased direct operating expenses per mcfe by 6% from the same period of 2017 (see discussion on page 35);           •  increased general and administrative expense per mcfe 4% from the same period of 2017 (see discussion on page 36);           •  interest expense per mcfe was the same when compared to the same period of 2017;           •  reduced our DD&A rate per mcfe by 6% from the same period of 2017;            •  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2018, 2019 and 2020; and           •  realized $545.5 million of cash flow from operating activities.    We generated $545.5 million of cash flows from operating activities in first six months 2018, an increase of $134.2 million from the same period of 2017 which reflects improvements in realized prices, higher production volumes and higher comparative working capital inflows ($2.5 million inflow during first six months 2018 compared to $14.3 million outflow in the same period of 2017). We ended the quarter with $404.6 million of available committed borrowing capacity, with an additional $1.0 billion in borrowing base capacity. 30  Adoption of New Accounting Standard On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standards update. As a result of this adoption, we have modified our presentation of certain gas processing contracts. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented based on the new accounting standards while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting. For additional information, see Note 3 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The impact of adoption of the new revenue recognition standard on the three and six month period ended June 30, 2018 is as follows (in thousands):           Three Months Ended June 30, 2018           Six Months Ended June 30, 2018          As Reported           Previous Revenue Recognition Method           As Reported           Previous Revenue Recognition Method       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                                 Natural gas  $  360,351        $  360,351        $  791,924        $  791,924       NGLs     224,703           182,557           427,230           347,257       Oil     76,336           76,336           138,865           138,865       Total  $  661,390        $  619,244        $  1,358,019        $  1,278,046                                                         Transportation, gathering,  processing and compression                                                 Natural gas  $  164,064        $  164,064        $  321,298        $  321,298       NGLs     105,846           63,700           193,240           113,267       Total  $  269,910        $  227,764        $  514,538        $  434,565       Net loss  $  (79,836  )     $  (79,836  )     $  (30,598  )     $  (30,598  )   See Note 3 for a discussion of new accounting standards that affect us. Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. Our revenues are generally recognized at the point in time that control of the product is transferred to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. In second quarter 2018, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 31% compared to second quarter 2017 with a 15% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and a 13% increase in average daily production. In first six months 2018, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 27% compared to the same period of 2017 with a 13% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and a 13% increase in production. NGLs sales for the current year includes the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, as described above. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, oil and condensate sales for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):        Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2018        2017        Change        %        2018     2017     Change     %       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                                                                  Natural gas   $  360,351        $  336,534        $  23,817        7  %      $  791,924     $  707,886     $  84,038     12  %    NGLs     224,703           123,784           100,919        82  %         427,230        261,847        165,383     63  %    Oil      76,336           45,819           30,517        67  %         138,865        95,854        43,011     45  %    Total natural gas, NGLs and  oil sales  $  661,390        $  506,137        $  155,253        31  %     $  1,358,019     $  1,065,587     $  292,432     27  %   31  Our production continues to grow through drilling success and additional NGLs extraction, which is partially offset by the natural production decline of our wells and non-core asset sales. Second quarter production volumes from the Marcellus Shale were 1.9 Bcfe per day, an increase of 26% when compared to the same period of 2017. Second quarter 2018 production volumes from our North Louisiana properties were approximately 313.3 Mmcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2017, our North Louisiana production volumes declined 25%. Production volumes from the Marcellus Shale in first six months 2018 were 1.8 Bcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2017, our Marcellus production volumes increased 23% for first six months 2018. In first six months 2018, production volumes for North Louisiana properties were approximately 339.7 Mmcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2017, our North Louisiana production volumes decreased 16%. Our production for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 is set forth in the following table:         Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2018        2017        Change        %        2018     2017     Change     %       Production (a)                                                                                  Natural gas (mcf)     136,057,805           119,487,827           16,569,978        14  %        271,011,900        235,744,164        35,267,736     15  %    NGLs (bbls)     9,483,910           8,524,267           959,643        11  %        18,753,941        17,060,995        1,692,946     10  %    Crude oil (bbls)     1,210,379           1,052,784           157,595        15  %        2,273,813        2,118,070        155,743     7  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     200,223,539           176,950,133           23,273,406        13  %        397,178,424        350,818,554        46,359,870     13  %                                                                                       Average daily production (a)                                                                                   Natural gas (mcf)     1,495,141           1,313,053           182,088        14  %        1,497,303        1,302,454        194,849     15  %    NGLs (bbls)     104,219           93,673           10,546        11  %        103,613        94,260        9,353     10  %    Crude oil (bbls)     13,301           11,569           1,732        15  %        12,563        11,702        861     7  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     2,200,259           1,944,507           255,752        13  %        2,194,356        1,938,224        256,132     13  %       (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.     (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.    32  Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) during second quarter 2018 was $1.88 per mcfe compared to $1.80 per mcfe in second quarter 2017. Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs) was $2.11 per mcfe in first six months 2018 compared to $1.98 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. We believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.

Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials and gains or losses realized from our basis hedging. The prices we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location, relative quality and other factors.

These third party costs are higher in 2018 when compared to 2017 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression agreements and the impact of our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation expenses paid by Range). 33  Transportation, gathering processing and compression was $514.5 million in first six months 2018 compared to $369.2 million in first six months 2017. These third-party costs are higher in 2018 when compared to 2017 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression agreements, including new in-service transportation costs and the impact of our adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.

Derivative fair value (loss) income was a loss of $117.3 million in first six months 2018 compared to a gain of $276.8 million in the same period of 2017. All of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment can result in more volatility of our revenues as the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions is included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate potentially lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate potentially higher future wellhead revenues.

Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives only represent the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. We believe that non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to differentiate non-cash fair market value adjustments from settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP, nor should it be considered a substitute for derivative fair value income or loss as reported in our consolidated statements of operations. 34  Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in second quarter 2018 was $98.1 million compared to $55.8 million in second quarter 2017 with significantly higher brokered sales volumes. Brokered natural gas marketing and other revenue in first six months 2018 was $158.1 million compared to $107.4 million in the same period of the prior year due to significantly higher brokered sales volumes. Operating Costs Per Mcfe We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:        Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2018        2017        Change        %        2018     2017     Change     %       Direct operating expense  $  0.18        $  0.18        $  —        —  %     $  0.18     $  0.17     $  0.01     6  %    Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.05           0.06           (0.01  )     (17  %)         0.05        0.05        —     —  %    General and administrative expense     0.24           0.30           (0.06  )     (20  %)         0.29        0.28        0.01     4  %    Interest expense     0.27           0.27           —        —  %         0.27        0.27        —     —  %    Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     0.80           0.86           (0.06  )     (7  %)         0.81        0.86        (0.05  )  (6  %)   Direct operating expense was $35.1 million in second quarter 2018 compared to $31.4 million in second quarter 2017. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Our direct operating costs increased in second quarter 2018 primarily due to higher water hauling/handling costs. Our production volumes increased 13%. We incurred $1.5 million ($0.01 per mcfe) of workover costs in second quarter 2018 compared to $1.7 million ($0.01 per mcfe) in second quarter 2017. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in second quarter 2018 was the same when compared to the same period of 2017. Direct operating expense was $73.2 million in first six months 2018 compared to $59.4 million in the same period of 2017. Our direct operating costs increased in first six months 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher water hauling/handling costs, equipment leasing and higher workovers. Our production volumes increased 13%. We incurred $4.9 million of workover costs in first six months 2018 compared to $3.4 million in the same period of 2017. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in first six months 2018 increased 6% to $0.18 from $0.17 in the same period of 2017 with the increase consisting of higher water hauling/handling costs. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:        Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2018        2017        Change        %        2018     2017     Change     %       Lease operating expense  $  0.17        $  0.17        $  —        —  %     $  0.17     $  0.16     $  0.01     6  %    Workovers     0.01           0.01           —        —  %         0.01        0.01        —     —  %    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     —           —           —        —  %         —        —        —     —  %    Total direct operating expense  $  0.18        $  0.18        $  —        —  %      $  0.18     $  0.17     $  0.01     6  %   35  Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $3.7 million in second quarter 2018 compared to $2.3 million in second quarter 2017 with an increase in commodity prices and higher volumes subject to production taxes. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” which functions as a tax on unconventional natural gas and oil production from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Included in second quarter 2018 is a $6.4 million impact fee compared to $7.7 million in second quarter 2017. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $7.1 million in first six months 2018 compared to $4.3 million in the same period of 2017 due to higher commodity prices and higher volumes subject to production taxes. Included in first six months 2018 is $13.0 million impact fee compared to $14.9 million in the same period 2017. The following table summarizes production and ad valorem taxes per mcfe for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:        Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2018        2017        Change        %        2018     2017     Change     %       Production taxes  $  0.01        $  0.01        $  —        —  %     $  0.01     $  0.01     $  —     —  %    Ad valorem taxes     0.01           0.01           —        —  %         0.01        —        0.01     —  %    Impact fee     0.03           0.04           (0.01  )     (25  %)         0.03        0.04        (0.01  )  (25  %)    Total production and ad valorem taxes  $  0.05        $  0.06        $  (0.01  )     (17  %)      $  0.05     $  0.05     $  —     —  %   General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $47.6 million in second quarter 2018 compared to $52.3 million in second quarter 2017. The second quarter 2018 decrease of $4.7 million when compared to the same period of 2017 is primarily due to lower stock-based compensation of $5.5 million, lower bad debt expense and lower franchise tax expense partially offset by higher consulting and legal costs. At June 30, 2018, the number of G&A employees increased 2% when compared to June 30, 2017. On a per mcfe basis, second quarter 2018 G&A expense decreased 20% from second quarter 2017 due to lower stock-based compensation costs and lower bad debt expense.  G&A expense for first six months 2018 increased $16.2 million when compared to the same period of the prior year due to higher stock-based compensation costs of $7.5 million, higher severance costs, higher land and legal consulting costs and higher technology costs. The higher stock-based compensation costs are related to those officers that qualified for the postretirement plan implemented in fourth quarter 2017 and therefore, also qualified for accelerated vesting of equity grants. In addition, the timing of senior executive equity grants was moved from May to March in 2018 to better align with our proxy statement filings. On a per mcfe basis, G&A for six months 2018 increased 4% from six months 2017 due to higher stock-based compensation.

On an absolute basis, the increase in interest expense for second quarter 2018 from the same period of 2017 was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances and slightly higher average interest rates. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for second quarter 2018 was $1.3 billion compared to $963.5 million in second quarter 2017 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 3.7% in second quarter 2018 compared to 2.6% in second quarter 2017.  On an absolute basis, the increase in interest expense for first six months 2018 from the same period of 2017 was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances and slightly higher average interest rates. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $1.3 billion for first six months 2018 compared to $944.9 million for the same period of 2017 and the weighted average interest rates on the bank credit facility were 3.5% in first six months 2018 compared to 2.5% in first six months 2017. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense was $161.0 million in second quarter 2018 compared to $152.5 million in second quarter 2017. This increase is due to a 13% increase in production volumes somewhat offset by a 6% decrease in depletion rates. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $0.78 per mcfe in second quarter 2018 compared to $0.83 per mcfe in second quarter 2017. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to the mix of production from our properties with lower depletion rates and asset sales.  DD&A expense was $323.3 million in first six months 2018 compared to $302.3 million in the same period of 2017. This is due to a 13% increase in production volumes somewhat offset by a 6% decrease in depletion rates. Depletion expense was $0.78 per mcfe in first six months 2018 compared to $0.83 in the same period of 2017. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017:        Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2018        2017        Change        %        2018     2017     Change     %       Depletion and amortization  $  0.78        $  0.83        $  (0.05  )     (6  %)     $  0.78     $  0.83     $  (0.05  )  (6  %)    Depreciation     0.01           0.01           —        —  %        0.01        0.01        —     —  %    Accretion and other     0.01           0.02           (0.01  )     (50  %)        0.02        0.02        —     —  %    Total DD&A expense  $  0.80        $  0.86        $  (0.06  )     (7  %)      $  0.81     $  0.86     $  (0.05  )  (6  %)   37  Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, termination costs, deferred compensation plan expenses, impairment of proved properties and gain on sale of assets. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants and PSUs. The following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation to functional expense categories for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):         Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2018        2017        2018 (1)     2017       Direct operating expense  $  539        $  522        $  1,130     $  1,046       Brokered natural gas and marketing expense     313           388           598        651       Exploration expense     371           528           1,122        1,035       General and administrative expense     8,814           14,279           32,725        25,197       Termination costs     —           (46  )        —        1,696       Total stock-based compensation  $  10,037        $  15,671        $  35,575     $  29,625          (1)  Includes $18.2 million accelerated vesting of equity grants. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $102.7 million in second quarter 2018 compared to $55.9 million in second quarter 2017. The increase reflects significantly higher broker purchase volumes. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $158.3 million for first six months 2018 compared to $109.4 million in the same period of 2017. This increase reflects significantly higher broker purchase volumes. Exploration expense was $7.5 million in second quarter 2018 compared to $14.5 million in second quarter 2017 due to lower seismic costs partially offset by higher personnel costs. Exploration expense was $15.2 million in first six months 2018 compared to $23.0 million in the same period of 2017 due to lower seismic costs partially offset by higher delay rental costs. The following table details our exploration expense for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2018        2017        Change        %        2018     2017     Change     %       Seismic  $  (522  )     $  7,089        $  (7,611  )     (107  %)     $  (60  )  $  8,953     $  (9,013  )  (101  %)    Delay rentals and other     3,996           3,917           79        2  %         8,109        6,738        1,371     20  %    Personnel expense     3,654           2,964           690        23  %         6,047        6,276        (229  )  (4  %)    Stock-based compensation expense     371           528           (157  )     (30  %)         1,122        1,035        87     8  %    Total exploration expense  $  7,499        $  14,498        $  (6,999  )     (48  %)     $  15,218     $  23,002     $  (7,784  )  34  %   Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $54.9 million in second quarter 2018 compared to $5.2 million in second quarter 2017. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $66.7 million in first six months 2018 compared to $9.6 million in the same period of 2017. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. In certain circumstances, our future plans to develop acreage may accelerate our impairment. The increase in abandonment expense in both the three month and six month periods from 2017 reflects additional expected lease expirations in North Louisiana. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.  Termination costs were a reduction of $96,000 in second quarter 2017 compared to none in second quarter 2018. In first quarter 2017, we implemented additional work force reductions which increased these costs to $2.4 million for estimated severance costs and $1.7 million of accelerated vesting of equity grants.  38  Deferred compensation plan expense was a loss of $6.6 million in second quarter 2018 compared to a gain of $14.5 million in second quarter 2017. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price increased from $14.54 at March 31, 2018 to $16.73 at June 30, 2018. In the same period of the prior year, our stock price decreased from $29.10 at March 31, 2017 to $23.17 at June 30, 2017. During first six months ended 2018, deferred compensation was a gain of $782,000 compared to a gain of $27.6 million in the same period of 2017. Our stock price decreased from $17.06 at December 31, 2017 to $16.73 at June 30, 2018. In the same period of 2017, our stock price decreased from $34.36 at December 31, 2016 to $23.17 at June 30, 2017. Impairment of proved properties was $15.3 million in second quarter 2018 and $7.3 million in first quarter 2018. In second quarter 2018, we recorded impairment expense related to certain properties in Northwest Pennsylvania and in first quarter 2018, we recorded impairment expense related to certain of our oil and gas properties in Oklahoma. These Oklahoma assets were evaluated for impairment due to the possibility of sale. Gain on the sale of assets was $156,000 in second quarter 2018 compared to $807,000 in second quarter 2017. In first six months 2018, gain on sale of assets was $179,000 compared to $23.4 million in the same period of 2017. In first quarter 2017, we sold properties in Western Oklahoma for $26.0 million of proceeds and, after closing adjustments, we recognized a gain of $22.1 million related to this sale.  Income tax (benefit) expense was a benefit of $28.5 million in second quarter 2018 compared to expense of $57.7 million in second quarter 2017. For second quarter 2018, the effective tax rate was 26.3% compared to 45.3% in 2017. Income tax expense was $14.2 million in first six months 2018 compared to $170.0 million in the same period of 2017. For first six months 2018, the effective tax rate was (86.1%) compared to 41.5% in first six months 2017. The 2018 and 2017 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes (including adjustments to state income tax valuation allowances), equity compensation and other discrete tax items which are detailed below. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% for the remainder of 2018, before any discrete tax items (dollars in thousands).

Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and because our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. As of June 30, 2018, we have entered into derivative agreements covering 297.6 Bcfe for the remainder of 2018, 321.2 Bcfe for 2019 and 4.8 Bcfe in 2020, not including our basis swaps. 39  The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):                   Six Months Ended June 30,              2018           2017       Sources of cash and cash equivalents                         Operating activities  $  545,515        $  411,328       Disposal of assets     366           27,288       Borrowing on credit facility     1,114,000           946,000       Other     31,108           36,343       Total sources of cash and cash equivalents  $  1,690,989        $  1,420,959                                 Uses of cash and cash equivalents                         Additions to natural gas and oil properties  $  (584,432  )     $  (469,644  )    Repayment on credit facility     (1,011,000  )        (874,000  )    Repayment of senior notes     —           (500  )    Acreage purchases     (37,900  )        (37,987  )    Additions to field service assets     (1,863  )        (2,966  )    Dividends paid     (9,960  )        (9,914  )    Debt issuance costs     (8,257  )        —       Other     (37,610  )        (25,742  )    Total uses of cash and cash equivalents  $  (1,691,022  )     $  (1,420,753  )   Net cash provided from operating activities in first six months 2018 was $545.5 million compared to $411.3 million in first six months 2017. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2017 to 2018 reflects a 13% increase in production and higher net realized prices (an increase of 7%) somewhat offset by higher operating costs. As of June 30, 2018, we have hedged more than 70% of our projected total production for the remainder of 2018, with more than 80% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first six months 2018 were positive $2.5 million compared to negative $14.3 million for first six months 2017.  Disposal of assets in first quarter 2017 includes $26.0 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain Western Oklahoma properties which closed in February 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operating activities, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first six months 2018, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2018, 2019 and 2020 to protect future cash flows. Effective April 13, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated revolving bank credit facility, which expires in April 2023, with terms that were similar to our previous bank credit facility. During first six months 2018, our net cash provided from operating activities of $545.5 million and borrowings under our bank credit facility were used to fund approximately $624.2 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At June 30, 2018, we had $415,000 in cash and total assets of $11.8 billion.  Long-term debt at June 30, 2018 totaled $4.2 billion, including $1.3 billion outstanding on our bank credit facility, $2.9 billion of senior notes and $49.0 million of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at June 30, 2018 was $404.6 million, with an additional $1.0 billion in borrowing base capacity available for increased liquidity potential. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. While our expectation is to operate within our internally generated cash flow, to the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally  40  generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A material decline in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and operate profitably. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year, taking into account various factors including the commodity price environment. Our 2018 capital budget is currently $941.2 million.  We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks relating to the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves. Commodity prices continue to be depressed and, as such, we have adjusted and must continue to adjust our business through efficiencies and cost reductions to compete in the current price environment which also requires reductions in overall debt levels over time. We plan to continue to work towards profitable growth within cash flows. We would expect to monitor the market and look for opportunities to refinance or reduce debt based on market conditions. Credit Arrangements  As of June 30, 2018, we maintained a revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of $2.0 billion, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility, during a non-investment grade period, is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of April 13, 2023. See Note 9 for additional information. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. Availability under the bank credit facility, during an investment grade period, is limited to aggregate lender commitments. As of June 30, 2018, the outstanding balance under our credit facility was $1.3 billion. Additionally, we had $281.4 million of undrawn letters of credit leaving $404.6 million of committed borrowing capacity available under the facility at the end of second quarter 2018, with an additional $1.0 billion in borrowing base capacity for potential increases in lender commitments. Our bank credit facility imposes limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under our bank credit facility). The bank credit facility also contains customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, investments and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2018. See Note 9 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our bank debt. Cash Dividend Payments  On June 1, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of two cents per share ($5.0 million) on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2018. The amount of future dividends is subject to discretionary declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors.  Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation, processing and gathering commitments. As of June 30, 2018, we do not have any capital leases. As of June 30, 2018, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of June 30, 2018, we had a total of $281.4 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2017, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $103.0 million increase in our outstanding bank credit facility balance and pricing changes for current contracts. Our contractual obligations for firm transportation and gathering contracts increased by approximately $171.0 million over the next twenty years related to these changes. 41  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We utilize commodity swap, collars and option contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are more consistent returns on invested capital and better access to bank and other credit markets, a more efficient utilization of existing personnel, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs. The fair value of these contracts which is represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination is based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX for natural gas and oil or Mont Belvieu for NGLs, approximated a pretax loss of $104.3 million at June 30, 2018. The contracts expire monthly through December 2020. At June 30, 2018, the following commodity-based derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed separately below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     Weighted Average Hedge Price    Natural Gas                            2018     Swaps      1,246,739 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.96       2019     Swaps     514,589 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.81       October-December 2018     Calls     70,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.10 (1)       2018     Swaptions     160,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.07 (2)       2019     Swaptions     317,945 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.86 (2)       2020     Swaptions     10,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.75 (2)                                    Crude Oil                            2018     Swaps     8,500 bbls/day        $ 53.20       2019     Swaps     6,624 bbls/day        $ 54.57       January-June 2020     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day        $ 57.00       January-March 2019     Collars     250 bbls/day        $ 63.00 − $ 73.00                                    NGLs (C2-Ethane)                            July-September 2018     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day        $ 0.30/gallon                                    NGLs (C3-Propane)                            2018     Swaps     10,918 bbls/day        $ 0.71/gallon                                    NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                            2018     Swaps     4,250 bbls/day        $ 0.81/gallon                                    NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                            2018     Swaps     5,152 bbls/day        $ 1.23/gallon       2019     Swaps     1,244 bbls/day        $ 1.30/gallon          (1)  Weighted average deferred premium of $0.16.     (2)  Contains a combined derivative instrument consisting of a fixed price swap and a sold option to extend or double the volume. For July through December of 2018, we have swaps in place for 160,000 Mmbtu per day on which the counterparty can elect to extend the contract through December 2019 at a weighted average price of $3.07. We have swaps in place for 2019 for 220,000 Mmbtu/day on which the counterparty can elect to double the volume at a weighted average price of $2.89. We also have swaps in place for 2019 for 130,000 Mmbtu per day on which the counterparty can elect to extend the contract through December 2020 at a weighted average price of $2.81. For 2020, we have swaps in place for 10,000 Mmbtu/day on which the counterparty can elect to double the volumes at a weighted average price of $2.75. In addition to the swaps, calls and swaptions discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we received for our natural gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX Henry Hub price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a loss of $1.9 million at June 30, 2018. The volumes are for 68,805,000 Mmbtu and they expire monthly through October 2020. At June 30, 2018, we also had propane basis swap contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. These contracts settle monthly through December 2019 and include total volume of 2,130,500 barrels. The fair value of these contracts was a loss of $2.1 million at June 30, 2018. 42  Interest Rates  At June 30, 2018, we had approximately $4.2 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $1.3 billion bears interest at floating rates, which was 3.8% at June 30, 2018. The 30-day LIBOR Rate on June 30, 2018 was approximately 2.1%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on June 30, 2018 would cost us approximately $13.1 million in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any significant off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments, some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2018 to continue to be a function of supply.        ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Changes in natural gas prices affect us more than changes in oil prices because approximately 67% of our December 31, 2017 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2017 to June 30, 2018.  43  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program can also include collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. We have also entered into natural gas derivative instruments containing a fixed price swap and a sold option (referred to as a swaption in the table below). At June 30, 2018, our derivative program includes swaps, calls, collars and swaptions. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of June 30, 2018, approximated a net unrealized pretax loss of $104.3 million. These contracts expire monthly through December 2020. At June 30, 2018, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed below:          Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged        Weighted Average Hedge Price     Fair Market Value    Natural Gas                          (in thousands)    2018     Swaps      1,246,739 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.96     $  34    2019     Swaps     514,589 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.81     $  (1,466)    October-December 2018     Calls     70,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.10 (1)     $  (701)    2018     Swaptions     160,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.07 (2)     $  (5,211)    2019     Swaptions     317,945 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.86 (2)     $  4,501    2020     Swaptions     10,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.75 (2)     $  225                                       Crude Oil                                  2018     Swaps     8,500 bbls/day        $ 53.20     $  (26,682)    2019     Swaps     6,624 bbls/day        $ 54.57     $  (24,977)    January-June 2020     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day        $ 57.00     $  (834)    January-March 2019     Collars     250 bbls/day        $ 63.00 − $ 73.00     $  12                                       NGLs (C2-Ethane)                                  July-September 2018     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day        $ 0.30/gallon     $  (85)                                       NGLs (C3-Propane)                                  2018     Swaps     10,918 bbls/day        $ 0.71/gallon     $  (22,591)                                       NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                                  2018     Swaps     4,250 bbls/day        $ 0.81/gallon     $  (8,906)                                       NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                                  2018     Swaps     5,152 bbls/day        $ 1.23/gallon     $  (13,541)    2019     Swaps     1,244 bbls/day        $ 1.30/gallon     $  (4,044)       (1)  Weighted average deferred premium of $0.16.     (2)  Contains a combined derivative instrument consisting of a fixed price swap and a sold option to extend or double the volume. For July through December of 2018 we have swaps in place for 160,000 Mmbtu per day on which the counterparty can elect to extend the contract through December 2019 at a weighted average price of $3.07. We have swaps in place for 2019 for 220,000 Mmbtu/day on which the counterparty can elect to double the volume at a weighted average price of $2.89. We also have swaps in place for 2019 for 130,000 Mmbtu per day on which the counterparty can elect to extend the contract through December 2020 at a weighted average price of $2.81. For 2020, we have swaps in place for 10,000 Mmbtu/day on which the counterparty can elect to double the volume at a weighted average price of $2.75. In the future, we expect our NGLs production to continue to increase. We believe NGLs prices are somewhat seasonal, particularly for propane. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional and international markets. If we are not able to sell or store NGLs, we may be required to curtail production or shift our drilling activities to dry gas areas. Currently, the Appalachian region has limited local demand and infrastructure to accommodate ethane. We have previously announced agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. Our Mariner East transportation agreement and our terminal/storage arrangements at Sunoco’s Marcus Hook Industrial Complex facility near Philadelphia began ethane operations in early 2016. We cannot assure you that these facilities will remain available. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these agreements, we may be required to curtail production or, as we have done in the past, purchase or divert natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas.  44  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. Therefore, in addition to the swaps discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX Henry Hub price because of basis adjustments, relative quality and other factors. Basis swap agreements effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the natural gas basis swaps was a loss of $1.9 million at June 30, 2018 and they settle monthly through October 2020. At June 30, 2018, we also had propane basis contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. The contracts settle monthly through December 2019 and include a total volume of 2,130,500 barrels. The fair value of these contracts was a loss of $2.1 million on June 30, 2018. The following table shows the fair value of our swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical changes in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at June 30, 2018. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                       Hypothetical Change in Fair Value        Hypothetical Change in Fair Value                         Increase of        Decrease of             Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%       Swaps     $  (103,092  )     $  (164,593  )     $  (411,491  )     $  165,968        $  416,941       Collars        12           (111  )        (297  )        100           276       Swaptions        (485  )        (64,267  )        (188,606  )        50,012           113,966       Calls        (701  )        (987  )        (3,289  )        489           677       Basis swaps        (4,021  )        (4,030  )        (10,073  )        4,017           10,244       Freight swap        166           101           254           (101  )        (255  )   Our commodity-based derivative contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified primarily among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At June 30, 2018, our derivative counterparties include twenty financial institutions, of which all but five are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are primarily major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial. Our propane sales from the Marcus Hook facility near Philadelphia are short-term and are to a single purchaser. Ethane sales from Marcus Hook are to a single international customer bearing a credit rating similar to Range. Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior and senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At June 30, 2018, we had $4.2 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $1.3 billion bears interest at floating rates, which was 3.8% on June 30, 2018. On June 30, 2018, the 30-day LIBOR Rate was approximately 2.1%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on June 30, 2018, would cost us approximately $13.1 million in additional annual interest expense.  45      ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2018 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 17 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part I Item 1 above for a summary of our legal proceedings, such information being incorporated herein by reference.  Environmental Proceedings Our subsidiary, Range Resources – Appalachia, LLC, was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”), in second quarter 2015, that it intends to assess a civil penalty under the Clean Streams Law and the 2012 Oil and Gas Act in connection with one well in Lycoming County. The DEP has directed us to prevent methane and other substances from escaping from this gas well into groundwater and a stream. We have considerable evidence that this well is not leaking and pre-drill testing of surrounding water wells showed the presence of methane in the water before commencement of our operations. While we intend to vigorously assert this position with the DEP, resolution of this matter may nonetheless result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.     ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K. 46      ITEM 6.  EXHIBITS
