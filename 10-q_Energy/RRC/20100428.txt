Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. These policies and estimates are described in the 2009 Form 10-K. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: accounting for oil and gas revenue, oil and gas properties, stock-based compensation, derivative financial instruments, asset retirement obligations and deferred income taxes.  Results of Operations  Overview   Total revenues increased $72.0 million, or 26% for first quarter 2010 over the same period of 2009. The increase includes a $33.6 million increase in oil and gas sales, a gain on the sale of our tight gas sand properties in Ohio of $67.0 million offset by a decrease in derivative fair value income of $33.2 million. Oil and gas sales vary due to changes in volumes of production sold and realized commodity prices. Due to volatility in oil and gas prices, realized prices decreased from the same period of the prior year, which was more than offset by an increase in production. For first quarter 2010, production increased 12% from the same period of the prior year while realized prices (including all derivative settlements) declined 16%. We believe oil and gas prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new regulations, new technology, and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for 2010 and 2011, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices we can enter into derivative contracts on additional volumes in the future.   With the lower commodity price environment, we continue to focus our efforts on improving our operating efficiency. These efforts resulted in 22% lower direct operating expense per mcfe for first quarter 2010 when compared to the same period of the prior year. We will continue to pursue reductions in operating and well costs to align costs with a lower commodity price environment. We continue to experience increases in general and administrative expenses per mcfe as we continue to hire employees to staff our Marcellus Shale operations. However, on a per mcfe basis, our first quarter general and administrative expense was the same as the first quarter of the prior year. We also continue to see higher fixed interest expense per mcfe due to the issuances of new fixed rate senior subordinated notes at higher interest rates than our floating rate bank credit facility.  Oil and Gas Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculation   Our oil and gas sales vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and volumes of production sold. Hedges included in oil and gas sales reflect settlement on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Cash settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in our consolidated statement of operations category called derivative fair value income. The following table summarizes the primary components of oil and gas sales for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):  20    Table of Contents                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2010     2009     Change     %       Oil wellhead   $ 35,884     $ 28,080     $ 7,804       28 %   Oil hedges realized     —       9,365       (9,365 )     (100 %)                                 Total oil sales   $ 35,884       37,445       (1,561 )     (4 %)                                                                     Gas wellhead     163,770       116,920       46,850       40 %   Gas hedges realized     1,215       41,958       (40,743 )     (97 %)                                 Total gas sales     164,985       158,878       6,107       4 %                                                                     NGL     35,891       6,866       29,025       423 %                                                                     Combined wellhead     235,545       151,866       83,679       55 %   Combined hedges     1,215       51,323       (50,108 )     (98 %)                                 Total oil and gas sales   $ 236,760     $ 203,189     $ 33,571       17 %                                    Our production continues to grow through continued drilling success as we place new wells into production, partially offset by the natural decline of our oil and gas wells and asset sales. For first quarter 2010, our production volumes increased, from the same period of the prior year, 46% in our Appalachian Area and decreased 9% in our Southwestern Area. Natural gas liquid (“NGL”) production increased 96% due to increased rich gas production in our Appalachia Area along with an increase in processing capacity in the region. Crude oil production declined primarily due to the sale of oil properties in West Texas effective June 30, 2009. Our production for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 is shown below:                                              Three Months Ended       March 31,       2010   2009   Change   %     Production:                                   Crude oil (bbls)     514,678       721,960       (207,282 )     (29 %)   NGLs (bbls)     831,136       423,261       407,875       96 %   Natural gas (mcf)     33,750,559       30,552,333       3,198,226       10 %   Total (mcfe)(a)     41,825,443       37,423,659       4,401,784       12 %                                       Average daily production:                                   Crude oil (bbls)     5,719       8,022       (2,303 )     (29 %)   NGLs (bbls)     9,235       4,703       4,532       96 %   Natural gas (mcf)     375,006       339,470       35,536       10 %   Total (mcfe)(a)     464,727       415,818       48,909       12 %                (a)   Oil and NGLs are converted at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf.   21    Table of Contents   Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements) received for oil and gas was $5.57 per mcfe in first quarter 2010 compared to $6.62 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Our average realized price calculation (including all derivative settlements) includes all cash settlement for derivatives, whether or not they qualify for hedge accounting. Average price calculations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 are shown below:                              Three Months Ended       March 31,       2010   2009     Average sales prices (wellhead):                   Crude oil (per bbl)   $ 69.72     $ 38.89     NGLs (per bbl)   $ 43.18     $ 16.22     Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 4.85     $ 3.82     Total (per mcfe)(a)   $ 5.63     $ 4.06                         Average realized price (including derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting):                   Crude oil (per bbl)   $ 69.72     $ 51.87     NGLs (per bbl)   $ 43.18     $ 16.22     Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 4.89     $ 5.20     Total (per mcfe)(a)   $ 5.66     $ 5.43                         Average realized price (including all derivative settlements):                   Crude oil (per bbl)   $ 69.72     $ 59.64     NGLs (per bbl)   $ 43.18     $ 16.22     Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 4.77     $ 6.47     Total (per mcfe)(a)   $ 5.57     $ 6.62                         Average NYMEX prices(b)                   Oil (per bbl)   $ 78.81     $ 43.20     Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 5.37     $ 4.86                  (a)   Oil and NGLs are converted at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf.

Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value income. We have also entered into basis swap agreements, which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are also marked to market. Not using hedge accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from non-hedge derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in AOCI in our consolidated balance sheet. Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in this statement of operations category, is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting.  22    Table of Contents   The following table presents information about the components of derivative fair value income for the three months March 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2010     2009       Hedge ineffectiveness – realized(c)   $ (357 )   $ 497     – unrealized(a)     (249 )     (453 )   Change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting(a)     46,578       31,525     Realized gain (loss) on settlements – gas(b)(c)     (3,639 )     38,372     Realized gain (loss) on settlements – oil(b)(c)     —       5,606                     Derivative fair value income   $ 42,333     $ 75,547                                  (a)   These amounts are unrealized and are not included in average sales price calculations.     (b)   These amounts represent realized gains and losses on settled derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.     (c)   These settlements are included in average realized price calculations (average realized price including all derivative settlements).    Gain on the sale of assets for first quarter 2010 increased $68.8 million from the same period of the prior year. In the first quarter, we closed on the sale of approximately 90% of our tight gas sand properties in Ohio and received proceeds of approximately $300.0 million for a gain of $67.0 million. We expect to close the remainder of the sale of our Ohio properties in the next quarter. We also expect proceeds for the entire transaction to be approximately $323.0 million.   Other loss for first quarter 2010 decreased to a loss of $1.6 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million in the same period of 2009. First quarter 2010 includes a loss from equity method investments of $1.6 million. The first quarter of 2009 includes a loss from equity method investments of $918,000.   We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about these expenses on an mcfe basis for the three months March 31, 2010 and 2009:                                              Three Months Ended       March 31,       2010   2009   Change   %     Direct operating expense   $ 0.74     $ 0.95     $ (0.21 )     (22 %)   Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.19       0.22       (0.03 )     (14 %)   General and administrative expense     0.67       0.67       —       — %   Interest expense     0.72       0.71       0.01       1 %   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     2.12       2.25       (0.13 )     (6 %)      Direct operating expense declined $4.5 million in first quarter 2010 to $31.0 million. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties. In first quarter 2010, this effect was more than offset by lower overall industry costs, lower workovers and asset sales. The first quarter 2009 included $3.9 million of operating costs related to properties sold in the second and fourth quarter 2009. On a per mcfe basis, excluding expenses on these same properties that have been sold, our 2009 direct operating expense would have been $0.89. On an absolute dollar basis, our spending for direct operating expense (excluding workovers) declined 12% for the three months ended March 31, 2010 despite higher production levels, due to cost containment measures and lower overall industry costs. We incurred $1.4 million ($0.03 per mcfe) of workover costs in first quarter 2010 versus $1.7 million ($0.05 per mcfe) in 2009. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses for first quarter 2010 decreased $0.21, or 22%, from the same period of 2009 with the decrease consisting primarily of lower workover costs ($0.02 per mcfe), lower utility costs ($0.02 per mcfe), lower water disposal costs ($0.04 per mcfe), lower overall well service costs and asset sales. Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009:  23    Table of Contents                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2010     2009     Change     %       Lease operating expense   $ 0.70     $ 0.88     $ (0.18 )     (20 %)   Workovers     0.03       0.05       (0.02 )     (40 %)   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.01       0.02       (0.01 )     (50 %)                                 Total direct operating expenses   $ 0.74     $ 0.95     $ (0.21 )     (22 %)                                    Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. For the first quarter, these taxes decreased $187,000 or 2% from the same period of the prior year due to lower property taxes and an increase in production volume not subject to production taxes somewhat offset by higher market prices. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes decreased to $0.19 in first quarter 2010 from $0.22 in the same period of 2009.   General and administrative expense for first quarter 2010 increased $3.3 million from the same period of the prior year due primarily to higher stock-based compensation ($1.6 million), slightly higher salaries and benefits ($735,000) and higher office expenses. Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009:                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2010     2009     Change     %       General and administrative   $ 0.49     $ 0.50     $ (0.01 )     (2 %)   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.18       0.17       0.01       6 %                                 Total general and administrative expenses   $ 0.67     $ 0.67     $ —       — %                                    Termination costs in the first quarter include severance costs of $5.1 million related to the sale of our tight gas sand properties in Ohio and $2.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of SARs and restricted stock as part of the severance agreement for our Ohio personnel.   Interest expense for first quarter 2010 increased $3.7 million from the same period of the prior year due to the refinancing of certain debt from floating to higher fixed rates which was somewhat offset by lower overall debt balances. In May 2009, we issued $300.0 million of 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019, which added $6.0 million of interest costs in first quarter 2010. The proceeds from the issuance were used to retire lower floating interest rate bank debt, to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for first quarter 2010 was $359.6 million compared to $787.2 million for the same period of the prior year and the weighted average interest rates were 2.1% in first quarter 2010 compared to 2.6% in the same period of the prior year.   Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) increased $4.3 million, or 5%, to $88.6 million in first quarter 2010. The increase was due to a 12% increase in production and was partially offset by a 6% decrease in depletion rates. On a per mcfe basis, DD&A decreased from $2.25 in first quarter 2009 to $2.12 in first quarter 2010. The following table summarizes DD&A expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009:                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2010     2009     Change     %       Depletion and amortization   $ 1.97     $ 2.09     $ (0.12 )     (6 %)   Depreciation     0.11       0.12       (0.01 )     (8 %)   Accretion and other     0.04       0.04       —       — %                                 Total DD&A expense   $ 2.12     $ 2.25     $ (0.13 )     (6 %)                                   24    Table of Contents   Impairment of proved properties in first quarter 2010 of $6.5 million was recognized due to declining gas prices and is related to our Gulf Coast properties. Our estimated fair value of producing properties is generally calculated as the discounted present value of future net cash flows. Our estimates of cash flow are based on the latest available proved reserve and production information and management’s estimates of future product prices and costs, based on available information such as forward strip prices.   Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties and deferred compensation plan expenses. In the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, stock-based compensation represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and expenses related to SAR grants. In first quarter 2010, stock-based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($493,000), exploration expense ($1.1 million), general and administrative expense ($7.8 million) and termination costs ($2.8 million) for a total of $12.6 million. In first quarter 2009, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($730,000), exploration expense ($1.1 million) and general and administrative expense ($6.2 million) for a total of $8.3 million.   Exploration expense increased $1.3 million in first quarter 2010 primarily due to higher delay rental costs. The following table details our exploration-related expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):                                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2010     2009     Change     %       Dry hole expense   $ —     $ 123     $ (123 )     (100 %)   Seismic     7,681       8,198       (517 )     (6 %)   Personnel expense     2,730       2,856       (126 )     (4 %)   Stock-based compensation expense     1,136       1,074       62       6 %   Delay rentals and other     3,088       1,088       2,000       184 %                                 Total exploration expense   $ 14,635     $ 13,339     $ 1,296       10 %                                    Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties expense was $12.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $19.6 million during the same period of 2009. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss at the time of impairment. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of a individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success.   Deferred compensation plan expense was income of $5.7 million in first quarter 2010 compared to expense of $12.4 million in the same period of the prior year. Our stock price decreased from $49.85 at December 31, 2009 to $46.87 at March 31, 2010. During the same period in the prior year, our stock price increased from $34.39 at December 31, 2008 to $41.16 at March 31, 2009. This non-cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in the deferred compensation plan. Our deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense.   Income tax expense for first quarter 2010 increased to $48.9 million from $18.8 million in first quarter 2009, reflecting a 146% increase in income from operations before taxes compared to the same period of 2009. First quarter 2010 provided for tax expense at an effective rate of 38.7% compared to tax expense at an effective rate of 36.6% in the same period of 2009. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 38.5% for 2010.  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Commitments   Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with both uncommitted and committed availability, asset sales and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. We currently estimate our 2010 capital spending will approximate $950.0 million, excluding acquisitions. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. During first quarter 2010, we sold our shallow tight sand Ohio properties for proceeds of approximately $300.0 million. We expect to close the second part of this sale in the second quarter for additional proceeds of approximately $20.0 million. We may use these proceeds to purchase or develop additional oil and gas proved or unproved properties. In first quarter 2010, we also entered into additional natural gas commodity derivative contracts for 2010 and 2011 to protect future cash flows. As part of our  25    Table of Contents  semi-annual bank review completed March 31, 2010, our borrowing base and facility amounts were reaffirmed at $1.5 billion and $1.25 billion.   During the three months ended March 31, 2010, our cash provided from operating activities was $152.9 million and we spent $172.6 million on capital expenditures and $19.8 million on acreage purchases. At March 31, 2010, we had $286.5 million in cash, total assets of $5.6 billion and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 40.7%. Long-term debt at March 31, 2010 totaled $1.7 billion, which included $354.0 million of bank credit facility debt and $1.4 billion of senior subordinated notes. Available committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility at March 31, 2010 was $895.9 million.   Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves, which is typical in the capital-intensive oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, our long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. Sustained lower oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We currently have approximately 65% of our total 2010 production subject to hedging agreements. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices, which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.   Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Credit Arrangements   On March 31, 2010, the bank credit facility had a $1.5 billion borrowing base and a $1.25 billion facility amount. The borrowing base represents an amount approved by the bank group that can be borrowed based on our assets, while our $1.25 billion facility amount is the amount we have requested that the banks commit to fund pursuant to the credit agreement. The bank credit facility provides for a borrowing base subject to redeterminations semi-annually each April and October and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. Remaining credit availability was $845.9 million on April 23, 2010. Our bank group is comprised of twenty-six commercial banks, with no one bank holding more than 5.0% of the bank credit facility. We believe our large number of banks and relatively low hold levels allow for significant lending capacity should we elect to increase our $1.25 billion commitment up to the $1.5 billion borrowing base and also allow for flexibility should there be additional consolidation within the banking sector.   Our bank credit facility and our indentures governing our senior subordinated notes all contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, enter into hedging contracts change the nature of our business or operations, merge or consolidate or make certain investments. In addition, we are required to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0 and a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with these covenants at March 31, 2010. Please see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.  Cash Flow   Cash flows from operating activities primarily are affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operating activities also are impacted by changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our oil and gas production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. However, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12 to 24 months. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowing under the credit facility. As of March 31, 2010, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 88.8 Bcfe for 2010 and 42.0 Bcfe for 2011.  26    Table of Contents   Net cash provided from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was $152.9 million compared to $149.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2009. Cash flow from operating activities for the first three months of 2010 was higher than the same period of the prior year, as higher production from development activity was somewhat offset by lower realized prices. Net cash provided from continuing operations is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows) in the three months ended March 31, 2010 was $24.0 million compared to $1.7 million in the same period of the prior year.   Net cash provided from investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was $108.1 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $250.1 million in the same period of 2009. The first three months of 2010 included $166.2 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $19.8 million of acreage purchases offset by proceeds of $301.6 million from asset sales. Acquisitions for the first three months of 2010 include the purchase of Marcellus Shale leasehold acreage for $16.5 million. The first three months of 2009 included $159.2 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $84.4 million of acreage purchases and other investments.   Net cash provided from financing for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was $24.8 million compared to $100.9 million in the first three months of 2009. In the first three months of 2010, we borrowed $148.0 million under our bank credit facility compared to borrowings of $250.0 million in the same period of the prior year. During the first three months of 2010, total debt increased $30.4 million.  Dividends   On March 1, 2010, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.4 million) on our common stock, which was paid on March 31, 2010 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2010.  Capital Requirements and Contractual Cash Obligations   We currently estimate our 2010 capital spending will approximate $950.0 million (excluding acquisitions) and based on current projections, is expected to be funded with internal cash flow and property sales. We may, from time to time during 2010, make borrowings under our credit facility but expect that for all of 2010 to require no significant incremental borrowing from our 2009 levels, assuming no change in our 2010 capital spending plans. Acreage purchases during the first quarter include $16.5 million of purchases in the Marcellus Shale and $1.8 million in the Barnett Shale, which were funded with borrowings under our credit facility. For the three months ended March 31, 2010, $177.3 million of our development and exploration spending was funded with internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting the amount up or down and between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may sell assets, issue subordinated notes or other debt securities, or issue additional shares of stock to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions, extend maturities or repay debt.   Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, transportation commitments and other liabilities. Since December 31, 2009, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations.  Other Contingencies   We are involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or consolidated financial position.  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices   We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. These contracts consist of collars and fixed price swaps. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital program. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. In light of current worldwide economic uncertainties, we recently have employed a strategy to hedge a portion of our production looking out 12 to 24 months from each quarter. At March 31, 2010, we had collars covering 129.1 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $5.69 and $7.22 per mcf and 0.3 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $75.00 and $93.75 per barrel. Their fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination, based on a comparison of contract prices and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on March 31, 2010 was a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $156.6 million. The contracts expire monthly through December 2011. Settled transaction gains and losses for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are determined monthly and are included as increases or  27    Table of Contents  decreases in oil and gas sales in the period the hedged production is sold. In the first three months of 2010, oil and gas sales included realized hedging gains of $1.2 million compared to gains of $51.3 million in the first three months of 2009.   At March 31, 2010, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                                      Average   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Hedge Price     Natural Gas                           2010   Collars   316,727 Mmbtu/day   $ 5.54-$7.21     2011   Collars   115,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 6.00-$7.24                                 Crude Oil                           2010   Collars   1,000 bbl/day   $ 75.00-$93.75        Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as a hedge but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and gas production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value as Unrealized derivative gains and losses on our consolidated balance sheet. We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts as Derivative fair value income in our consolidated statement of operations. As of March 31, 2010, derivatives on 38.5 Bcfe no longer qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting.   In addition to the swaps and collars above, we have entered into basis swap agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market. The price we receive for our production can be less than NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a net unrealized pre-tax loss of $16.3 million at March 31, 2010.  Interest Rates   At March 31, 2010, we had $1.7 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.4 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.4%. Bank debt totaling $354.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 2.2% at March 31, 2010. The 30-day LIBOR rate on March 31, 2010 was 0.2%.  Debt Ratings   We receive debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, Inc. (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”), which are subject to regular reviews. S&P’s rating for us is BB with a stable outlook. Moody’s rating for us is Ba2 with a stable outlook. We believe that S&P and Moody’s consider many factors in determining our ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels, asset, and proved reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing.  Inflation and Changes in Prices   Our revenues, the value of our assets, our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Oil and gas prices are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. During first quarter 2010, we received an average of $69.72 per barrel of oil and $4.85 per mcf of gas before derivative contracts compared to $38.89 per barrel of oil and $3.82 per mcf of gas in the same period of the prior year. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and accelerated through the middle of 2008, commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly. The higher prices led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on capital costs. Due to the decline in commodity prices since then, costs have moderated. We expect costs in 2010 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.  28    Table of Contents     ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposures. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Financial Market Risk   The debt and equity markets have exhibited adverse conditions since late 2007. The unprecedented volatility and upheaval in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets. At this point, we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent events in the global markets and we do not expect our liquidity to be materially impacted in the near future. We will continue to monitor our liquidity and the capital markets. Additionally, we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our twenty-six lenders in the bank credit facility. Beginning in late 2009 and continuing into first quarter 2010, we have observed improving market conditions. Bank lending availability and access to long-term debt markets have improving market conditions. Bank lending availability and access to long-term debt markets have improved considerably from 2008.  Market Risk   Our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years.  Commodity Price Risk   We periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production. These arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. At times, certain of our derivatives have been swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. Historically, we applied hedge accounting to derivatives utilized to manage price risk associated with our oil and gas production. Accordingly, we recorded change in the fair value of our swap and collar contracts under the balance sheet caption accumulated other comprehensive income and into oil and gas sales when the forecasted sale of production occurred. Any hedge ineffectiveness associated with contracts qualifying for and designated as a cash flow hedge is reported currently each period under our consolidated statement of operations caption derivative fair value income. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and gas production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet under the captions unrealized derivative gains and losses. We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in our consolidated statement of operations under the caption derivative fair value income. Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Our derivative counterparties include thirteen financial institutions, twelve of which are in our bank group. J. Aron & Company is the counterparty not in our bank group. At March 31, 2010, our net derivative payable includes a payable to J. Aron & Company of $2.2 million. None of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that would require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date.   As of March 31, 2010, we had collars covering 129.1 Bcf of gas and 0.3 million barrels of oil. These contracts expire monthly through December 2011. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of March 31, 2010, approximated a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $156.6 million.  29    Table of Contents   At March 31, 2010, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                                                      Fair Market Value                                 as of                                 March 31, 2010     Period   Contract Type     Volume Hedged     Average Hedge Price     Asset (Liability)                                 (in thousands)       Natural Gas                                   2010   Collars   316,727 Mmbtu/day   $ 5.54-$7.21     $ 118,397     2011   Collars   115,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 6.00-$7.24     $ 38,472                                         Crude Oil                                   2010   Collars   1,000 bbl/day   $ 75.00-$93.75     $ (253 )     Other Commodity Risk   We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. In addition to the collars and swaps detailed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements, which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market. The price we receive for our gas production can be less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a net realized pre-tax loss of $16.3 million at March 31, 2010.   The following table shows the fair value of our collars and the hypothetical change in the fair value that would result from a 10% change in commodity prices at March 31, 2010. The hypothetical change in fair value would be a gain or loss depending on whether prices increase or decrease (in thousands):                                      Hypothetical Change       Fair Value   in Fair Value     Collars   $ 156,616     $ 51,000        Interest rate risk. At March 31, 2010, we had $1.7 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.4 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.4%. Senior bank debt totaling $354.0 million bore interest at floating rates averaging 2.2%. A 1% increase or decrease in short-term interest rates would affect interest expense by approximately $3.5 million per year.     ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2010 at the reasonable assurance level.  30    Table of Contents  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  31    Table of Contents     PART II – OTHER INFORMATION     ITEM 1A.
