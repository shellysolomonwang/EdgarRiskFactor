Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and crude oil properties primarily in the Appalachian and North Louisiana regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on a geographical or an area-by-area basis.  Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through returns-focused growth, on a per share debt-adjusted basis, of both reserves and production. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions and divestitures of non-core assets. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire, produce and market natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. The price risk on a portion of our production is mitigated using commodity derivative contracts. However, these derivative contracts are limited in duration. Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices continue to be depressed. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect:        •  revenues, profitability and cash flow;        •  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce;         •  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil shown as proved reserves;        •  the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures; and        •  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities.  30  Market Conditions Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for these commodities are inherently volatile. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGLs composite price for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:         Three Months EndedMarch 31,             2018        2017        Change        %          Average NYMEX prices (a)                                                 Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.99        $  3.29        $  (0.30  )     (9  %)       Oil (per bbl)     62.88           51.81           11.07        21  %       Mont Belvieu NGLs composite (per gallon) (b)     0.62           0.54           0.08        15  %             (a)  Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.

Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview of First Quarter 2018 Results  During first quarter 2018, we reported the following financial and operating results:         •  13% production growth over the same period of 2017;           •  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil increased 25% from the same period of 2017 with a 10% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and an increase in production volumes;           •  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives increased 27% from the same period of 2017;           •  derivative non-cash fair value adjustments decreased $192.7 million due to increasing prices;            •  increased direct operating expenses per mcfe by 19% from the same period of 2017 (see discussion on page 34);           •  increased general and administrative expense per mcfe, excluding stock-based compensation, 10% from the same period of 2017 (see discussion on page 35);           •  interest expense per mcfe was the same compared to the same period of 2017;           •  reduced our depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) rate per mcfe by 5% from the same period of 2017;            •  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2018, 2019 and 2020; and           •  realized $370.6 million of cash flow from operating activities, an increase of $144.7 million from the same period of 2017.    Our financial results are significantly impacted by commodity prices. For first quarter 2018, we experienced an increase in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 8% increase in net realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by us) and 13% higher production volumes when compared to the same quarter of 2017. Daily production in first quarter 2018 averaged 2.2 Bcfe compared to 1.9 Bcfe in the same period of the prior year. Average natural gas differentials improved $0.31 per mcf while operating costs were higher.  During first quarter 2018, we recognized net income of $49.2 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share compared to net income of $170.1 million, or $0.69 per diluted common share, during first quarter 2017. The decrease in net income for first quarter 2018 from first quarter 2017 is primarily due to lower derivative fair value income or the non-cash fair value adjustments related to our derivatives and higher proved property impairment charges.  We generated $370.6 million of cash flows from operating activities in first quarter 2018, an increase of $144.7 million from first quarter 2017 which reflects improvements in realized prices, higher production volumes and lower comparative working capital outflows ($54.6 million inflow during first quarter 2018 compared to $20.8 million outflow in first quarter 2017). We ended the quarter with $536.6 million of available committed borrowing capacity.  31  Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. Our revenues are generally recognized at the point in time that control of the product is transferred to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. In first quarter 2018, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 25% compared to first quarter 2017 with a 10% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and a 13% increase in average daily production. NGLs sales for the current year includes the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard where NGLs revenue was increased by $37.8 million and NGLs transportation expense was also increased by $37.8 million. This reflects a change in our accounting for sales to one of our midstream processing entities. For additional information regarding the new revenue recognition accounting standard, see Note 3 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, oil and condensate sales for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2018        2017        Change        %       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                              Gas   $  431,573        $  371,352        $  60,221        16  %     NGLs     202,527           138,063           64,464        47  %     Oil      62,529           50,035           12,494        25  %     Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales  $  696,629        $  559,450        $  137,179        25  %   Our production continues to grow through drilling success and additional NGLs extraction, which is partially offset by the natural production decline of our wells and non-core asset sales. First quarter 2018 production volumes from our North Louisiana properties were approximately 366.4 Mmcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2017, our North Louisiana production volumes declined 8%. Production volumes from the Marcellus Shale in first quarter 2018 were 1.8 Bcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2017, our Marcellus production volumes increased 20% from first quarter 2017. Our production for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is set forth in the following table:         Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2018        2017        Change        %       Production (a)                                              Natural gas (mcf)     134,954,095           116,256,337           18,697,758        16  %    NGLs (bbls)     9,270,031           8,536,728           733,303        9  %    Crude oil (bbls)     1,063,434           1,065,286           (1,852  )     —  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     196,954,885           173,868,421           23,086,464        13  %    Average daily production (a)                                               Natural gas (mcf)     1,499,490           1,291,737           207,753        16  %    NGLs (bbls)     103,000           94,853           8,147        9  %    Crude oil (bbls)     11,816           11,837           (21  )     —  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     2,188,388           1,931,871           256,517        13  %       (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.     (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) during first quarter 2018 was $2.34 per mcfe compared to $2.17 per mcfe in first quarter 2017. We believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.  32  Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials. The prices we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location, relative quality and other factors. Average natural gas differentials were $0.21 per mcf above NYMEX in first quarter 2018 compared to $0.10 per mcf below NYMEX in first quarter 2017. We also realized losses on our basis hedging in first quarter 2018 of $0.08 per mcf compared to a realized gain of $0.11 per mcf in first quarter 2017. Average realized price calculations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 are shown below:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2018        2017        Change        %       Average Prices                                              Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements):                                              Natural gas (per mcf)  $  3.20        $  3.19        $  0.01        —  %    NGLs (per bbl)     21.85           16.17           5.68        35  %    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     58.80           46.97           11.83        25  %    Total (per mcfe) (a)     3.54           3.22           0.32        10  %    Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements):                                              Natural gas (per mcf)  $  3.44        $  3.26        $  0.18        6  %    NGLs (per bbl)     20.20           14.49           5.71        39  %    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     50.98           49.50           1.48        3  %    Total (per mcfe) (a)     3.58           3.19           0.39        12  %    Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range):                                              Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.27        $  2.21        $  0.06        3  %    NGLs (per bbl)     10.77           8.00           2.77        35  %    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     50.98           49.50           1.48        3  %    Total (per mcfe) (a)     2.34           2.17           0.17        8  %       (a)  Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  Transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense was $244.6 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $177.6 million in first quarter 2017. These third-party costs are higher in 2018 when compared to 2017 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third-party transportation, gathering, processing and compression agreements and a $37.8 million increase related to our adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard which is reflected in NGLs expense below. For additional information regarding the new revenue recognition accounting standard see Note 3 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation expenses paid by Range). The following table summarizes transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands) and on a per mcf and per barrel basis:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,                2018           2017           Change        %          Natural gas   $  157,234        $  122,194        $  35,040        29  %       NGLs     87,394           55,454           31,940        58  %       Total  $  244,628        $  177,648        $  66,980        38  %                                                         Natural gas (per mcf)  $  1.17        $  1.05        $  0.12        11  %       NGLs (per bbl)  $  9.43        $  6.50        $  2.93        45  %      33  Derivative fair value (loss) income was a loss of $14.0 million in first quarter 2018 compared to income of $165.6 million in first quarter 2017. All of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment can result in more volatility of our revenues as the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions is included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. The following table summarizes the impact of our commodity derivatives for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):           Three Months Ended March 31,             2018           2017          Derivative fair value (loss) income per consolidated statements of operations  $  (14,009  )     $  165,557                                       Non-cash fair value (loss) gain: (1)                            Natural gas derivatives  $  (41,097  )     $  99,063          Oil derivatives     (9,342  )        16,567          NGLs derivatives     27,815           54,056          Freight derivatives     (310  )        52          Total non-cash fair value (loss) gain (1)  $  (22,934  )     $  169,738                                       Net cash receipt (payment) on derivative settlements:                            Natural gas derivatives  $  32,508        $  7,455          Oil derivatives     (8,315  )        2,697          NGLs derivatives     (15,268  )        (14,333  )       Total net cash receipt (payment)   $  8,925        $  (4,181  )             (1)  Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives only represent the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. We believe that non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to differentiate non-cash fair market value adjustments from settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP, nor should it be considered a substitute for derivative fair value income or loss as reported in our consolidated statements of operations. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in first quarter 2018 was $60.0 million compared to $51.6 million in first quarter 2017 with significantly higher sales volumes and slightly higher sales prices for our brokered natural gas volumes. Operating Costs Per mcfe We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,             2018        2017        Change        %          Direct operating expense  $  0.19        $  0.16        $  0.03        19  %       Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.05           0.05           —        —  %        General and administrative expense     0.35           0.27           0.08        30  %        Interest expense     0.27           0.27           —        —  %        DD&A     0.82           0.86           (0.04  )     (5  %)       Direct operating expense was $38.1 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $28.0 million in first quarter 2017. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Our direct operating costs increased in first quarter 2018 primarily due to higher water hauling/ handling costs, equipment leasing and higher workovers. We incurred $3.3 million ($0.02 per mcfe) of workover costs in first quarter 2018 compared to $1.7 million in first quarter 2017. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in first quarter 2018 increased 19% from the same period of 2017 with the increase consisting of higher workover and water hauling/handling costs.    34         Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2018        2017        Change        %       Lease operating expense  $  0.17        $  0.15        $  0.02        13  %    Workovers     0.02           0.01           0.01        100  %     Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     —           —           —        —  %     Total direct operating expense  $  0.19        $  0.16        $  0.03        19  %    Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $3.3 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $2.0 million in first quarter 2017 with an increase in volumes subject to production taxes. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $0.02 in first quarter 2018 compared to $0.01 in first quarter 2017. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” which functions as a tax on unconventional natural gas and oil production from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Included in first quarter 2018 is a $6.6 million impact fee ($0.03 per mcfe) compared to $7.2 million ($0.04 per mcfe) in first quarter 2017.  General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $68.4 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $47.5 million in first quarter 2017. The first quarter 2018 increase of $20.9 million when compared to the same period of 2017 is primarily due to higher stock-based compensation of $17.7 million, higher technology expenses, higher land and legal consulting costs and higher severance costs. The higher stock-based compensation costs are related to those officers that qualified for the postretirement plan implemented in fourth quarter 2017 and therefore, also qualified for accelerated vesting of equity grants. The timing of senior executive equity grants was moved from May to March in 2018 to better align with our proxy filings. At March 31, 2018, the number of G&A employees increased 2% when compared to March 31, 2017. On a per mcfe basis, first quarter 2018 G&A expense increased 30% from first quarter 2017 due to higher stock-based compensation costs and higher technology, severance and consulting costs. The following table summarizes G&A expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2018        2017        Change        %       General and administrative  $  0.23        $  0.21        $  0.02        10  %    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.12           0.06           0.06        100  %    Total general and administrative expense  $  0.35        $  0.27        $  0.08        30  %   Interest expense was $52.4 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $47.1 million in first quarter 2017. The following table presents information about interest expense per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:         Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2018        2017        Change        %       Bank credit facility  $  0.07        $  0.04        $  0.03        75  %    Senior notes     0.19           0.22           (0.03  )     (14  %)    Subordinated notes     —           —           —        —  %     Amortization of deferred financing costs and other     0.01           0.01           —        —  %    Total interest expense  $  0.27        $  0.27        $  —        —  %       Average debt outstanding (in thousands)  $  4,220,796        $  3,852,362        $  368,434        10  %    Average interest rate (a)     4.9  %        4.7  %        0.2  %     4  %   (a) Includes commitment fees but excludes debt issue costs and amortization of discounts. On an absolute basis, the increase in interest expense for first quarter 2018 from the same period of 2017 was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances and slightly higher average interest rates. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for first quarter 2018 was $1.3 billion compared to $926.3 million in first quarter 2017 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 3.4% in first quarter 2018 compared to 2.4% in first quarter 2017.  Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense was $162.3 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $149.8 million in first quarter 2017. This increase is due to a 13% increase in production volumes somewhat offset by a 5% decrease in depletion rates. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $0.79 per mcfe in first quarter 2018 compared to $0.83 per mcfe in first quarter 2017. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve  35  report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to the mix of production from our properties with lower depletion rates and asset sales. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2018        2017        Change        %       Depletion and amortization  $  0.79        $  0.83        $  (0.04  )     (5  %)    Depreciation     0.01           0.01           —        —  %    Accretion and other     0.02           0.02           —        —  %    Total DD&A expense  $  0.82        $  0.86        $  (0.04  )     (5  %)    Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, termination costs, deferred compensation plan expenses, impairment of proved properties and gain on sale of assets. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants and PSUs. The following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation to functional expense categories for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):         Three Months Ended March 31,             2018 (1)        2017          Direct operating expense  $  591        $  524          Brokered natural gas and marketing expense     285           263          Exploration expense     751           507          General and administrative expense     23,911           10,918          Termination costs     —           1,742          Total stock-based compensation  $  25,538        $  13,954         (1) Includes $18.2 million accelerated vesting of equity grants. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $55.6 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $53.6 million in first quarter 2017. The increase reflects significantly higher broker purchase volumes. Exploration expense was $7.7 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $8.5 million in first quarter 2017 due to lower seismic and personnel costs partially offset by higher delay rental costs. The following table details our exploration expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedMarch 31,          2018        2017        Change        %       Seismic  $  462        $  1,864        $  (1,402  )     (75  %)    Delay rentals and other     4,111           2,821           1,290        46  %     Personnel expense     2,393           3,312           (919  )     (28  %)     Stock-based compensation expense     751           507           244        48  %     Dryhole expense     2           —           2        —  %    Total exploration expense  $  7,719        $  8,504        $  (785  )     (9  %)   Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $11.8 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $4.4 million in first quarter 2017. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. In certain circumstances, our future plans to develop acreage may accelerate our impairment. The increase in abandonment expense reflects additional expected lease expirations in both North Louisiana and Pennsylvania. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the  36  current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.  Termination costs were a reduction of $37,000 in first quarter 2018 compared to an increase of $4.2 million in the same period of 2017. In first quarter 2017, we implemented additional work force reductions which increased these costs to $2.4 million for estimated severance costs and $1.7 million of accelerated vesting of equity grants.  Deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of $7.4 million in first quarter 2018 compared to a gain of $13.2 million in first quarter 2017. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price decreased from $17.06 at December 31, 2017 to $14.54 at March 31, 2018. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price decreased from $34.36 at December 31, 2016 to $29.10 at March 31, 2017.  Impairment of proved properties was $7.3 million in first quarter 2018. In first quarter 2018, we recorded impairment expense related to certain of our oil and gas properties in Oklahoma. These assets were evaluated for impairment due to the possibility of sale. Gain on the sale of assets was $23,000 in first quarter 2018 compared to $22.6 million in first quarter 2017. In first quarter 2017, we sold properties in Western Oklahoma for $26.0 million of proceeds and, after closing adjustments, we recognized a gain of $22.1 million related to this sale.  Income tax expense was $42.7 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $112.4 million in first quarter 2017. For first quarter 2018, the effective tax rate was 46.4% compared to 39.8% in 2017. The 2018 and 2017 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes (including adjustments to state income tax valuation allowances), equity compensation and other discrete tax items which are detailed below. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 24% for the remainder of 2018, before any discrete tax items (dollars in thousands).

Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and because our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year-to-year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. As of March 31, 2018, we have entered into derivative agreements covering 365.4 Bcfe for the remainder of 2018, 194.5 Bcfe for 2019 and 273 Mmcfe in 2020, not including our basis swaps. 37  The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):                   Three Months Ended March 31,             2018           2017       Sources of cash and cash equivalents                         Operating activities  $  370,572        $  225,862       Disposal of assets     40           26,053       Borrowing on credit facility     528,000           448,000       Other     13,485           25,051       Total sources of cash and cash equivalents  $  912,097        $  724,966                                 Uses of cash and cash equivalents                         Additions to natural gas and oil properties  $  (308,641  )     $  (186,727  )    Repayment on credit facility     (557,000  )        (484,000  )    Repayment of senior notes     —           (500  )    Acreage purchases     (25,355  )        (28,725  )    Additions to field service assets     (239  )        (1,565  )    Dividends paid     (4,971  )        (4,951  )    Other     (15,812  )        (18,267  )    Total uses of cash and cash equivalents  $  (912,018  )     $  (724,735  )   Net cash provided from operating activities in first quarter 2018 was $370.6 million compared to $225.9 million in first quarter 2017. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2017 to 2018 reflects a 13% increase in production and higher net realized prices (an increase of 8%) somewhat offset by higher operating costs. As of March 31, 2018, we have hedged more than 60% of our projected total production for the remainder of 2018, with more than 70% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first quarter 2018 were positive $54.6 million compared to negative $20.8 million for first quarter 2017.  Disposal of assets in first quarter 2017 includes $26.0 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain Western Oklahoma properties which closed in February 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operating activities, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first three months 2018, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2018, 2019 and 2020 to protect future cash flows. Effective April 13, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated revolving bank credit facility, which expires in April 2023, with terms that were similar to our previous bank credit facility. During first quarter 2018, our net cash provided from operating activities of $370.6 million and borrowings under our bank credit facility were used to fund approximately $334.2 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At March 31, 2018, we had $527,000 in cash and total assets of $11.7 billion.  Long-term debt at March 31, 2018 totaled $4.1 billion, including $1.2 billion outstanding on our bank credit facility, $2.9 billion of senior notes and $49.0 million of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at March 31, 2018 was $536.6 million. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. While our expectation is to operate within our internally generated cash flow, to the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as  38  various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A further material decline in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and operate profitably. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year, taking into account various factors including the commodity price environment. Our 2018 capital budget is currently $941.2 million.  We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks relating to the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves. Commodity prices continue to be depressed and, as such, we have adjusted and must continue to adjust our business through efficiencies and cost reductions to compete in the current price environment which also requires reductions in overall debt levels over time. We plan to continue to work towards profitable growth within cash flows. We would expect to monitor the market and look for opportunities to refinance or reduce debt based on market conditions. Credit Arrangements  As of March 31, 2018, we maintained a revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of $2.0 billion, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility, during a non-investment grade period, is secured by substantially all of our assets and had a maturity date of October 16, 2019. Effective April 13, 2018, we entered into a amended and restated revolving credit facility. See Note 9 for additional information. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. Availability under the bank credit facility, during an investment grade period, is limited to aggregate lender commitments. As of March 31, 2018, the outstanding balance under our credit facility was $1.2 billion. Additionally, we had $281.4 million of undrawn letters of credit leaving $536.6 million of committed borrowing capacity available under the facility at the end of first quarter 2018.  Our bank credit facility imposes limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under our bank credit facility). The bank credit facility also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, investments and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2018. See Note 9 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our bank debt, including the five-year renewal and extension effective April 13, 2018. Cash Dividend Payments  On March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of two cents per share ($5.0 million) on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on March 31, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 16, 2018. The amount of future dividends is subject to discretionary declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors.  Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation, processing and gathering commitments. As of March 31, 2018, we do not have any capital leases. As of March 31, 2018, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of March 31, 2018, we had a total of $281.4 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2017, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $29.0 million decrease in our outstanding bank credit facility balance and pricing changes for current contracts. Our contractual obligations for firm transportation and gathering contracts increased by approximately $52.2 million over the next twenty years related to these changes. 39  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We utilize commodity swap and option contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. The fair value of these contracts which is represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination is based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX for natural gas and oil or Mont Belvieu for NGLs, approximated a pretax loss of $19.9 million at March 31, 2018. The contracts expire monthly through December 2020. At March 31, 2018, the following commodity-based derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed separately below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price    Natural Gas                            2018     Swaps      1,001,127 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.96       2019     Swaps     324,658 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.82       October-December 2018     Calls     70,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.10 (1)       2018     Swaptions     160,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.07 (2)       2019     Swaptions     170,137 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.92 (2)                                    Crude Oil                            2018     Swaps     8,748 bbls/day        $ 53.25       2019     Swaps     5,872 bbls/day        $ 53.73       January-June 2020     Swaps     250 bbls/day        $ 55.00                                    NGLs (C2-Ethane)                            2018     Swaps     250 bbls/day        $ 0.29/gallon                                    NGLs (C3-Propane)                            2018     Swaps     7,451 bbls/day        $ 0.68/gallon                                    NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                            2018     Swaps     4,333 bbls/day        $ 0.81/gallon                                    NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                            2018     Swaps     4,904 bbls/day        $ 1.21/gallon       January-June 2019     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day        $ 1.24/gallon      (1) Weighted average deferred premium of $0.16.

We also have swaps in place for 2019 for 40,000 Mmbtu per day on which the counterparty can elect to extend the contract through December 2020 at a weighted average price of $2.85.  In addition to the swaps, calls and swaptions discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we received for our natural gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX Henry Hub price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a gain of $2.2 million at March 31, 2018. The volumes are for 91,440,000 Mmbtu and they expire monthly through October 2020. At March 31, 2018, we also had propane basis swap contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. These contracts settle monthly through December 2019 and include total volume of 2,063,000 barrels. The fair value of these contracts was a loss of $1.4 million on March 31, 2018. Interest Rates  At March 31, 2018, we had approximately $4.1 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $1.2 billion bears interest at floating rates, which was 3.4% at March 31, 2018. The 30-day  40  LIBOR Rate on March 31, 2018 was approximately 1.9%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on March 31, 2018 would cost us approximately $11.8 million in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any significant off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments, some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2018 to continue to be a function of supply.    ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Changes in natural gas prices affect us more than changes in oil prices because approximately 67% of our December 31, 2017 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018.  41  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program can also include collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. We have also entered into natural gas derivative instruments containing a fixed price swap and a sold option (referred to as a swaption in the table below). At March 31, 2018, our derivative program includes swaps, calls and swaptions. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of March 31, 2018, approximated a net unrealized pretax loss of $19.9 million. These contracts expire monthly through December 2020. At March 31, 2018, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged        Weighted Average Hedge Price     Fair Market Value    Natural Gas                          (in thousands)    2018     Swaps      1,001,127 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.96     $  35,091    2019     Swaps     324,658 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.82     $  728    October-December 2018     Calls     70,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.10 (1)     $  (853)    2018     Swaptions     160,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.07 (2)     $  10,249    2019     Swaptions     170,137 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.92 (2)     $  (116)                                       Crude Oil                                  2018     Swaps     8,748 bbls/day        $ 53.25     $  (23,642)    2019     Swaps     5,872 bbls/day        $ 53.73     $  (10,381)    January-June 2020     Swaps     250 bbls/day        $ 55.00     $  (43)                                       NGLs (C2-Ethane)                                  2018     Swaps     250 bbls/day        $ 0.29/gallon     $  24                                       NGLs (C3-Propane)                                  2018     Swaps     7,451 bbls/day        $ 0.68/gallon     $  (15,073)                                       NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                                  2018     Swaps     4,333 bbls/day        $ 0.81/gallon     $  (4,084)                                       NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                                  2018     Swaps     4,904 bbls/day        $ 1.21/gallon     $  (11,112)    January-June 2019     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day        $ 1.24/gallon     $  (648)   (1) Weighted average deferred premium of $0.16. (2) Contains a combined derivative instrument consisting of a fixed price swap and a sold option to extend or double the volume. For April through December of 2018 we have swaps in place for 160,000 Mmbtu per day on which the counterparty can elect to extend the contract through December 2019 at a weighted average price of $3.07. We have swaps in place for 2019 for 140,000 Mmbtu/day on which the counterparty can elect to double the volume at a weighted average price of $2.93. We also have swaps in place for 2019 for 40,000 Mmbtu per day on which the counterparty can elect to extend the contract through December 2020 at a weighted average price of $2.85. In the future, we expect our NGLs production to continue to increase. We believe NGLs prices are somewhat seasonal, particularly for propane. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional and international markets. If we are not able to sell or store NGLs, we may be required to curtail production or shift our drilling activities to dry gas areas. Currently, the Appalachian region has limited local demand and infrastructure to accommodate ethane. We have previously announced agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. Our Mariner East transportation agreement and our terminal/storage arrangements at Sunoco’s Marcus Hook Industrial Complex facility near Philadelphia began ethane operations in early 2016. We cannot assure you that these facilities will remain available. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these agreements, we may be required to curtail production or, as we have done in the past, purchase or divert natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in  42  one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. Therefore, in addition to the swaps discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX Henry Hub price because of basis adjustments, relative quality and other factors. Basis swap agreements effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the natural gas basis swaps was a gain of $2.2 million at March 31, 2018 and they settle monthly through October 2020. At March 31, 2018, we also had propane basis contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. The contracts settle monthly through December 2019 and include a total volume of 2,063,000 barrels. The fair value of these contracts was a loss of $1.4 million on March 31, 2018. The following table shows the fair value of our swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical changes in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at March 31, 2018. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                       Hypothetical Changein Fair Value        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value                         Increase of        Decrease of             Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%       Swaps     $  (29,140  )     $  (157,611  )     $  (393,542  )     $  158,980        $  398,998       Swaptions        10,133           (43,229  )        (125,723  )        34,979           80,702       Calls        (853  )        (914  )        (2,931  )        530           800       Basis swaps        788           (1,030  )        (2,557  )        1,014           2,641       Freight swap        (34  )        124           310           (124  )        (314  )   Our commodity-based derivative contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified primarily among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At March 31, 2018, our derivative counterparties include nineteen financial institutions, of which all but five are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are primarily major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial. Our propane sales from the Marcus Hook facility near Philadelphia are short-term and are to a single purchaser. Ethane sales from Marcus Hook are to a single international customer bearing a credit rating similar to Range. Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior and senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At March 31, 2018, we had $4.1 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $1.2 billion bears interest at floating rates, which was 3.4% on March 31, 2018. On March 31, 2018, the 30-day LIBOR Rate was approximately 1.9%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on March 31, 2018, would cost us approximately $11.8 million in additional annual interest expense.      ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2018 at the reasonable assurance level.  43  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 17 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part I Item 1 above for a summary of our legal proceedings, such information being incorporated herein by reference.  Environmental Proceedings Our subsidiary, Range Resources – Appalachia, LLC, was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”), in second quarter 2015, that it intends to assess a civil penalty under the Clean Streams Law and the 2012 Oil and Gas Act in connection with one well in Lycoming County. The DEP has directed us to prevent methane and other substances from escaping from this gas well into groundwater and a stream. We have considerable evidence that this well is not leaking and pre-drill testing of surrounding water wells showed the presence of methane in the water before commencement of our operations. While we intend to vigorously assert this position with the DEP, resolution of this matter may nonetheless result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.     ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K. 44      ITEM 6.  EXHIBITS
