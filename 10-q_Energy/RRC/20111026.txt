Item 1A. Risk Factors as filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 filed with the SEC on March 1, 2011.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. These policies and estimates are described in our Current Report on Form 8-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 filed with the SEC on May 6, 2011. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: accounting for natural gas, NGL and oil revenue, natural gas and oil properties, stock-based compensation, derivative financial instruments, asset retirement obligations and deferred income taxes.  Market Conditions   Prices for natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Commodity prices can fluctuate widely. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.

Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview   We are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties, mostly in the Appalachia and Southwest regions of the United States. Our objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas and oil reserves. To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and oil, we currently, and may in the future, enter into derivative contracts. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital program. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Our corporate headquarters is located in Fort Worth, Texas. Discontinued operations consist of our Barnett Shale properties which were sold in April and August of 2011. Unless otherwise indicated, the information included herein relates to our continuing operations.  24    Table of Contents   During the first nine months of 2011, we achieved the following financial and operating results from our continuing operations:       •   achieved 31% year-over-year production growth;        •   daily production now exceeds 534.4 mmcfe per day;        •   natural gas, NGL and oil sales increased 38% from the first nine months 2010;        •   reduced our DD&A rate 8% from the first nine months 2010;        •   year-over-year direct operating expense per mcfe decreased 3% while production and ad valorem tax expense per mcfe declined 11% and general and administrative expense per mcfe declined 17%;        •   sold substantially all of our Barnett Shale properties for gross proceeds of $889.3 million, including assumed hedges;        •   sold non-strategic properties in East Texas and Pennsylvania for proceeds of $17.0 million;        •   entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2011, 2012 and 2013;        •   renewed our bank credit facility with a borrowing base of $2.0 billion;        •   issued $500.0 million of new 5.75% senior subordinated notes, at par; and        •   used the proceeds from the issuance of $500.0 million of new 5.75% senior subordinated notes to retire all $150.0 million principal amount of our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and all $250.0 million principal amount of our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016.    Third Quarter Highlights   Total revenues increased $143.1 million, or 73% for third quarter 2011 over the same period of 2010. The increase includes an $84.0 million increase in natural gas, NGL and oil sales and an increase in derivative fair value income of $55.8 million. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales vary due to changes in volumes of production sold and realized commodity prices. Realized prices increased an average of 6% from the same period last year. Production increased 35% including a 35% increase in NGL production primarily due to increased liquids-rich production in our Appalachia area. For third quarter 2011, production increased 35% while realized prices (including all derivative settlements) increased 6%. In third quarter 2011, we completed the sale of the remainder of our Barnett Shale properties for total cash proceeds of $12.4 million. See also Notes 4 and 5 for specific information on the sale of these assets including their treatment as discontinued operations. In the third quarter 2011, we sold various East Texas producing properties for proceeds of $11.0 million and certain Pennsylvania producing properties for proceeds of $6.0 million.   We continue to believe natural gas, NGL and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new regulations, new technology, the level of natural gas and oil production in North America and worldwide political conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for 2011, 2012 and 2013, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future.  Natural Gas, NGL and Oil Sales Production and Realized Price Calculation   Our natural gas, NGL and oil sales vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and volumes of production sold. Hedges included in natural gas, NGL and oil sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. The cash settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in derivative fair value income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

For third quarter 2011, total production volumes, when compared to the same period of the prior year, increased 54% in our Appalachia area and decreased 3% in our Southwest area. For each of the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2011, NGL production increased from the same period of the prior year primarily due to increased liquids-rich gas production in our Appalachia area along with an increase in processing capacity in the region. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, our production volumes, as compared to the same period of the prior year, increased 47% in our Appalachia area and remained the same in our Southwest area. Our production for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 is shown below:                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2011     2010     Change     %     2011     2010     Change     %       Production (a):                                                                   Natural gas (mcf)     37,441,857       27,350,286       10,091,571       37 %     100,058,851       77,148,685       22,910,166       30 %   NGLs (bbls)     1,430,568       1,059,485       371,083       35 %     3,798,635       2,398,684       1,399,951       58 %   Crude oil (bbls)     523,074       453,147       69,927       15 %     1,462,168       1,432,805       29,363       2 %   Total (mcfe)(b)     49,163,709       36,426,083       12,737,626       35 %     131,623,669       100,137,624       31,486,045       31 %                                                                       Average daily production (a):                                                                   Natural gas (mcf)     406,977       297,286       109,691       37 %     366,516       282,596       83,920       30 %   NGLs (bbls)     15,550       11,516       4,034       35 %     13,914       8,786       5,128       58 %   Crude oil (bbls)     5,686       4,926       760       15 %     5,356       5,248       108       2 %   Total (mcfe) (b)     534,388       395,936       138,452       35 %     482,138       366,804       115,334       31 %                 (a)    Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.

Derivative fair value income was $65.8 million in third quarter 2011 compared to $10.0 million in the same period of 2010. Derivative fair value income was $78.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared to $58.9 million in the same period of 2010. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Mark-to-market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from non-hedge derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in this statement of operations category, is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we recorded a $1.7 million loss related to the sale of certain derivatives included with the sale of our Barnett Shale properties and we received proceeds of $40.0 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we recorded a gain of $77.4 million from the sale of our Ohio properties and we received proceeds of $323.0 million.   Other income (loss) for third quarter 2011 was a loss of $375,000 compared to a loss of $1.0 million in the same period of 2010. Third quarter 2011 includes loss from equity method investments of $641,000. The third quarter of 2010 includes a loss from equity method investments of $845,000. Other income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 increased from a loss of $1.9 million in 2010 to income of $268,000 in 2011. The nine months ended September 30, 2011 includes proceeds from settlements of various lawsuits and refunds partially offset by a loss from equity method investments of $1.4 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2010 includes a loss from equity method investments of $1.8 million.   We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about these expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2011     2010     Change     %     2011     2010     Change     %       Direct operating expense   $ 0.61     $ 0.70     $ (0.09 )     (13 %)   $ 0.66     $ 0.68     $ (0.02 )     (3 %)   Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.15       0.19       (0.04 )     (21 %)     0.17       0.19       (0.02 )     (11 %)   General and administrative expense     0.73       1.00       (0.27 )     (27 %)     0.83       1.00       (0.17 )     (17 %)   Interest expense     0.70       0.64       0.06       9 %     0.69       0.65       0.04       6 %   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     1.90       1.91       (0.01 )     (1 %)     1.85       2.02       (0.17 )     (8 %)      Direct operating expense increased $4.3 million in third quarter 2011 to $29.8 million. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties. We incurred $1.2 million ($0.03 per mcfe) of workover costs in third quarter 2011 versus $736,000 ($0.02 per mcfe) in 2010. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses for third quarter 2011 decreased $0.09, or 13%, from the same period of 2010 with the decrease primarily due to lower well service costs ($0.07) and lower well equipment costs ($0.02 per mcfe), which were partially offset by higher workover costs ($0.01 per mcfe).   Direct operating expense increased $18.5 million in the first nine months 2011 to $87.1 million. We incurred $2.2 million ($0.02 per mcfe) of workover costs in the first nine months of 2011 compared to $2.5 million ($0.03 per mcfe) in the same period of 2010. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense decreased $0.02 or 3% from the same period of the prior year with the decrease consisting primarily of lower well service costs ($0.03 per mcfe), lower workover costs ($0.01 per mcfe) and the impact of the sale of certain higher operating cost assets during 2010. We expect to experience lower costs on a per mcfe basis as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating costs relative to our other operating areas. Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants.   The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2011     2010     Change     %     2011     2010     Change     %       Lease operating expense   $ 0.57     $ 0.67     $ (0.10 )     (15 %)   $ 0.63     $ 0.64     $ (0.01 )     (2 %)   Workovers     0.03       0.02       0.01       50 %     0.02       0.03       (0.01 )     (33 %)   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.01       0.01       —       — %     0.01       0.01       —       — %                                                           Total direct operating expenses   $ 0.61     $ 0.70     $ (0.09 )     (13 %)   $ 0.66     $ 0.68     $ (0.02 )     (3 %)                                                             28    Table of Contents   Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. For third quarter 2011, these taxes increased $414,000 or 6% from the same period of the prior year with higher prices partially offset by an increase in production volumes not subject to production taxes. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes per mcfe decreased to $0.15 in third quarter 2011 compared to $0.19 in the same period of 2010. For the first nine months of 2011, these taxes increased $2.6 million or 14% from the same period of the prior year due to a decrease in the number of wells receiving high cost tax credits and higher NGL production volumes subject to production taxes which was partially offset by an increase in production volumes not subject to production taxes and lower prices. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes decreased to $0.17 in the first nine months of 2011 compared to $0.19 in the same period of 2010.   General and administrative expense for third quarter 2011 decreased $616,000 or 2% from the same period of the prior year due primarily to lower community relations costs ($3.6 million), which were partially offset by higher stock-based compensation ($670,000), higher legal costs ($750,000) and higher bad debt expense ($850,000). General and administrative expense for the first nine months of 2011 increased $8.5 million or 8% from the same period of the prior year primarily due to higher stock-based compensation ($1.1 million), higher salaries and benefits ($2.9 million), higher legal fees ($940,000), higher bad debt expense ($446,000) and higher office expenses, including information technology. Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2011     2010     Change     %     2011     2010     Change     %       General and administrative   $ 0.56     $ 0.79     $ (0.23 )     (29 %)   $ 0.62     $ 0.74     $ (0.12 )     (16 %)   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.17       0.21       (0.04 )     (19 %)     0.21       0.26       (0.05 )     (19 %)                                                         Total general and administrative expenses   $ 0.73     $ 1.00     $ (0.27 )     (27 %)   $ 0.83     $ 1.00     $ (0.17 )     (17 %)                                                              Interest expense for third quarter 2011 increased $10.8 million from the same period of the prior year due to the refinancing of certain debt from floating to higher fixed rates. In May 2011, we issued $500.0 million of new 5.75% senior subordinated notes due 2021, and used a portion of the proceeds to retire our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016 to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties, which added $7.2 million of interest costs in third quarter 2011. A portion of the proceeds were also used for general corporate purposes. In August 2010, we issued $500.0 million of 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020, which added $4.6 million of interest costs in third quarter 2010. The third quarter 2010 includes $10.4 million of interest costs allocated to discontinued operations. There was no outstanding bank debt for third quarter 2011 compared to average bank debt outstanding of $361.1 million for the same period of the prior year. The weighted average interest rate was 2.3% in the third quarter 2010.   Interest expense for the nine months increased $24.8 million from the same period of the prior year due to the refinancing of certain debt from floating to higher fixed rates. In May 2011, we issued $500.0 million of 5.75% senior subordinated notes due 2021, which added $10.1 million of interest costs in the first nine months of 2011. In August 2010, we issued $500.0 million of 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020, which added $4.6 million of interest costs in the first nine months of 2011. Average debt outstanding on the credit facility for the first nine months 2011 was $197.5 million compared to $380.6 million for the same period of the prior year and the weighted average interest rate was 2.2% in both the nine months periods ending September 30, 2011 and 2010. The nine months ending September 30, 2011 includes $14.8 million allocated to discontinued operations compared to $29.3 million in the same period of the prior year.   Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) increased $23.9 million, or 34%, to $93.6 million in third quarter 2011. The increase was due to a 35% increase in production. On a per mcfe basis, DD&A decreased from $1.91 in third quarter 2010 to $1.90 in third quarter 2011. Depletion expense for third quarter 2011 includes an adjustment of $4.2 million to record prior years depletion related to our Oklahoma properties. Excluding this adjustment, the DD&A rate would have been $1.82 per mcfe for third quarter 2011 and $1.82 per mcfe for the first nine months 2011. In the first nine months of 2011, DD&A increased $41.8 million with a 31% increase in production partially offset by a 7% decrease in depletion rates. Depletion rates are declining due to our lower finding and development costs and the mix of our production. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010:  29    Table of Contents                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2011     2010     Change     %     2011     2010     Change     %       Depletion and amortization   $ 1.77     $ 1.77     $ —       — %   $ 1.73     $ 1.86     $ (0.13 )     (7 %)   Depreciation     0.08       0.11       (0.03 )     (27 %)     0.08       0.12       (0.04 )     (33 %)   Accretion and other     0.05       0.03       0.02       67 %     0.04       0.04       —       — %                                                           Total DD&A expense   $ 1.90     $ 1.91     $ (0.01 )     (1 %)   $ 1.85     $ 2.02     $ (0.17 )     (8 %)                                                              Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, termination costs, deferred compensation plan expenses and impairment of proved properties. In the three months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, stock-based compensation represents the amortization of restricted stock grants, restricted stock units and expenses related to SAR grants. In third quarter 2011, stock-based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($463,000), exploration expense ($902,000) and general and administrative expense ($8.5 million) for a total of $10.2 million. In third quarter 2010, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($544,000), exploration expense ($1.0 million) and general and administrative expense ($7.8 million) for a total of $9.7 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2011, stock-based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($1.4 million), exploration expense ($3.2 million) and general and administrative expense ($27.5 million) for a total of $33.2 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2010, stock-based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($1.5 million), exploration expense ($3.2 million) and general and administrative expense ($26.4 million) for a total of $32.0 million.   Exploration expense increased $2.4 million in third quarter 2011 and increased $12.6 million in the first nine months of 2011 from the same periods of the prior year. The three months ended September 30, 2011 includes higher seismic and dry hole costs partially offset by lower delay rentals. The nine months ended September 30, 2011 includes higher seismic costs, higher personnel and dry hole costs partially offset by lower delay rentals. The delay rental payments, or costs to defer the commencement of drilling, are primarily attributed to our Marcellus Shale operations. The following table details our exploration-related expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010 (in thousands):                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2011     2010     Change     %     2011     2010     Change     %       Dry hole expense   $ 2,508     $ 1,662     $ 846       51 %   $ 2,515     $ 1,661     $ 854       51 %   Seismic     8,619       6,428       2,191       34 %     26,156       14,474       11,682       81 %   Personnel expense     3,058       2,884       174       6 %     10,234       8,524       1,710       20 %   Stock-based compensation expense     849       1,026       (177 )     (17 %)     3,115       3,231       (116 )     (4 %)   Delay rentals and other     2,572       3,225       (653 )     (20 %)     14,365       15,894       (1,529 )     (10 %)                                                           Total exploration expense   $ 17,606     $ 15,225     $ 2,381       16 %   $ 56,385     $ 43,784     $ 12,601       29 %                                                              Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties expense was $16.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2011 compared to $14.4 million during the same period of 2010. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $52.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared to $30.7 million in the same period of the prior year. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. The increase from the prior year is primarily due to increasing expirations in our Marcellus Shale area.   Termination costs in the first nine months of 2010 includes severance costs of $5.1 million related to the sale of our properties in Ohio and $2.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of SARs and restricted stock as part of the severance agreement for our Ohio personnel.   Deferred compensation plan expense was $8.7 million in third quarter 2011 compared to income of $5.3 million in the same period of the prior year. This non-cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in the deferred compensation plan. Our deferred compensation liability is  30    Table of Contents  adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense in the accompanying statements of operations. Our stock price increased from $55.50 at June 30, 2011 to $58.46 at September 30, 2011. During the same period in the prior year, our stock price decreased from $40.15 at June 30, 2010 to $38.13 at September 30, 2010. Deferred compensation plan expense was $33.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared to income of $25.2 million in the same period of the prior year. Our stock price increased from $44.98 at December 31, 2010 to $58.46 at September 30, 2011. During the same nine month period of the prior year our stock price decreased from $49.85 at December 31, 2009 to $38.13 at September 30, 2010.   Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $18.6 million. In May and June 2011, we purchased or redeemed our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 at a price equal to 102.31% and we purchased or redeemed our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016 at a price equal to 103.95%. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $18.6 million which includes a call premium and other consideration of $13.3 million and expensing of related deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt. Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $5.4 million. In August 2010 we redeemed our 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013 at a redemption price equal to 101.22%. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.4 million, which includes call premium costs of $2.5 million and expensing of related deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt.   Impairment of proved properties for the three months ended September 30, 2011 was $38.7 million which includes an impairment of $31.2 million related to our East Texas properties and $7.5 million related to our Gulf Coast onshore properties. Our analysis of these properties reflected undiscounted cash flows for these properties were less than their carrying value. We compared the carrying value to their estimated fair value and recognized an impairment charge. These assets were evaluated for impairment due to declining reserves and natural gas prices and in the case of the East Texas properties, the possibility of a sale. Impairment of proved properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $38.7 million compared to $6.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Impairment in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 relates to our Gulf Coast onshore properties. Our estimated fair value of producing properties is generally calculated as the discounted present value of future net cash flows. In 2011 and 2010, our estimates of cash flow were based on the latest available proved reserves and production information and management’s estimates of future product prices and costs, which is based on available information such as forward strip prices, at the time of the impairment.   Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2011 increased to $22.5 million from $784,000 in third quarter 2010, reflecting a $52.3 million increase in continuing income from operations before taxes compared to the same period of 2010. Third quarter 2011 provided for tax expense at an effective rate of 40.4% compared to tax expense at an effective rate of 22.8% in the same period of 2010. Income tax expense for the first nine months 2011 decreased to $35.3 million from $61.6 million in the first nine months 2010, reflecting a 49% decrease in continuing income from operations before taxes. The first nine months 2011 provided for tax expense at an effective rate of 43.7% compared to an effective tax rate of 38.6% in the same period of 2010. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40% for the remainder of 2011. Our overall effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate of 35% due to state income taxes, valuation allowances and other permanent differences.   Discontinued operations for the first nine months of 2011 includes the operating results of our Barnett properties through the date of sale and a pre-tax gain of $4.9 million recorded on the sale. See also Notes 4 and 5 for specific information regarding our discontinued operations.  Capital Resources, Liquidity and Financial Condition  Capital Resources   Our primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of assets and proceeds from financing activities. If internal cash flow and cash on hand do not meet our expectations, we may reduce our level of capital expenditures, and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures under our bank credit facility, issue debt or equity securities and/or sell assets.  Cash Flow   Cash flows from operating activities primarily are affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operating activities also are impacted by changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our natural gas, NGL and oil production at the wellhead under floating market price contracts. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGL and oil production. The production that we hedge has and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any  31    Table of Contents  interim cash needs can be funded by borrowing under the credit facility. As of September 30, 2011, we have entered into derivative agreements covering 38.9 Bcfe for 2011, 120.7 Bcfe for 2012 and 58.4 Bcfe for 2013.   Net cash provided from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $393.1 million compared to $329.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2011 was higher than the same period of the prior year, as higher production from development activity, higher realized prices and a $23.0 million equity method investment distribution was partially offset by higher operating costs. Net cash provided from continuing operations is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) in the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was a decrease of $72.7 million compared to an increase of $12.4 million in the same period of the prior year.   During the second and third quarters of 2011, we completed the sale of primarily all of our Barnett Shale properties for gross cash proceeds of $889.3 million, including assumed hedges and before post-closing adjustments, resulting in a pretax gain of $4.9 million. The net cash proceeds from the sale of these assets were determined in accordance with the purchase and sale agreement which provides for certain customary adjustments for matters occurring after the effective date of the sale, such as capital contributions and working capital adjustments. Differences between actual working capital amounts and estimated working capital amounts recorded as of September 30, 2011 will be recorded as income or loss from discontinued operations in future periods.   Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $256.3 million compared to net cash provided from financing activities of $128.3 million in the same period of 2010. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we:       •   borrowed $490.8 million and repaid $764.8 million under our bank credit facility, ending the period with no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility;        •   issued $500.0 million principal amount of 5.75% senior subordinated notes due 2021, at par;        •   purchased or redeemed $150.0 million principal amount of our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 at a redemption price of 102.31% and purchased or redeemed $250.0 million principal amount of our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016 at a redemption price of 103.9%;        •   spent $22.0 million related to debt issuance costs; and        •   recorded a decrease of $39.8 million in cash overdrafts.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we:       •   borrowed $784.0 million and repaid $943.0 million under our bank credit facility, ending the period with a $91.0 million lower bank credit facility balance;        •   issued $500.0 million principal amount of 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020, at par;        •   redeemed $200.0 million principal amount of our 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013 at a redemption price of 101.229%; and        •   recorded an increase of $7.6 million in cash overdrafts.    Credit Arrangements   On September 30, 2011, the bank credit facility had a $2.0 billion borrowing base, a $1.5 billion facility amount and we had no outstanding borrowings. The borrowing base represents an amount approved by the bank group that can be borrowed based on our assets, while our $1.5 billion facility amount is the amount we have requested that the banks commit to fund pursuant to the credit agreement. The bank credit facility provides for a borrowing base subject to redeterminations semi-annually each April and October and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. As part of our semi-annual bank review completed October 12, 2011 our borrowing base and facility amounts were reaffirmed at $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion. Remaining credit availability was approximately $1.4 billion on October 21, 2011. Our bank group is comprised of twenty-six commercial banks with no one bank holding more than 7.0% of the bank credit facility. We believe our large number of banks and relatively low hold levels allow for significant lending capacity should we elect to increase our $1.5 billion commitment up to the $2.0 billion borrowing base and also allow for flexibility should there be additional consolidation within the banking sector.   Our bank credit facility and our indentures governing our senior subordinated notes all contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, enter into hedging contracts, change the nature of our business or operations, merge or consolidate or make certain investments. In addition, we are required to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) of no greater than 4.25 to 1.0 and a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2011. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.  32    Table of Contents   In May 2011, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior subordinated notes due 2021 for net proceeds after underwriting discounts and commissions of $491.3 million. The 5.75% Notes were issued at par. Interest on the 5.75% Notes is payable semi-annually in June and December and is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. We may redeem the 5.75% Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 1, 2016, at redemption prices of 102.875% of the principal amount as of June 1, 2016 declining to 100.0% on June 1, 2019 and thereafter. Before June 2014, we may redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Notes at a redemption price equal to 105.75% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings, provided that 65% of the aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Notes remain outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption and also provided such redemption shall occur within 60 days of the date of closing of the equity offering. On closing, we used $112.9 million of the proceeds to redeem our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and $207.1 million to redeem our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016 as part of the tender offer described below.   On May 11, 2011, we commenced cash tender offers to purchase the entire outstanding $150.0 million principal amount of our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and $250.0 million principal amount of our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016. On May 25, 2011, after the expiration of the tender offers, we accepted for purchase $108.9 million in principal of the 2015 notes at 102.375% of par and $198.8 million in principal of the 2016 notes for 104.00% of par. We called the remaining 2015 and 2016 notes, redeeming all of the remaining outstanding 2015 notes ($41.1 million) at 102.125% of par on June 24, 2011 and redeeming all of the remaining outstanding 2016 notes ($51.2 million) at 103.75% of par on June 24, 2011. During second quarter 2011, we recognized an $18.6 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, including transaction call premium cost as well as expensing of deferred financing cost on repurchased debt.   In June 2009, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability, subject to market conditions, to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of registered debt and equity securities.   As we pursue our strategy, we may utilize various financing sources, including, to the extent available, fixed and floating rate debt, or common stock. We may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties.  Liquidity   Our principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility. As of September 30, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and we were in compliance with all of its debt covenants. After adjusting for $22.2 million of undrawn and outstanding letters of credit, we had approximately $1.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2011. Our letter of credit requirements may change based on our financial condition and our debt credit ratings from the major rating agencies.   If internal cash flow and cash on hand do not meet our expectations, we may reduce our level of capital expenditures, and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures using borrowings under our bank credit facility, issue debt or equity securities or receive cash from other sources, such as asset sales. We cannot provide any assurance that needed short-term or long-term liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Although we expect that internal operating cash flows, cash on hand and borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility will be adequate to fund capital expenditures and provide adequate liquidity to fund other needs, no assurances can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet our future needs. For instance, the amount that we may borrow under the bank credit facility in the future could be reduced as a result of lower oil, NGL or gas prices, among other items.   Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Capital Commitments   Our primary needs for cash are for capital expenditures on natural gas and oil assets, payment of contractual obligations, dividends and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally- generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of assets or external financing sources. We expect we will be able to fund our needs for cash (excluding acquisitions) with internally-generated cash flows, cash on hand and liquidity under our credit facility, although no assurances can be given that such funding will be adequate to meet our future needs. We generally strive to limit our capital expenditures to internally-generated cash flow plus proceeds from asset sales. We establish a  33    Table of Contents  capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year. Our 2011 capital budget (excluding acquisitions) now stands at $1.47 billion and focuses on projects we believe will generate and lay the foundation for economic, long-term production growth.  Investing Activities   Net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $953.3 million compared to $476.6 million in the same period of 2010. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we:       •   spent $855.4 million on natural gas and oil property additions;        •   spent $151.1 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and        •   received proceeds of $66.2 million primarily from the sale of a low pressure pipeline, from the sale of properties in East Texas and Pennsylvania and from the sale of certain hedges as part of our Barnett Shale sale.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we:       •   spent $540.5 million on natural gas and oil property additions;        •   spent $249.7 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and        •   received proceeds of $327.5 million primarily from the sale of our Ohio oil and gas properties.    Dividends   On September 30, 2011, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.4 million) on our common stock, which was paid on September 30, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 15, 2011. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board and, if declared, the Board may change the current dividend amount based on our liquidity and capital resources.  Contractual Obligations   Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, transportation commitments and other purchase obligations. The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of September 30, 2011 (in thousands).

(b)   The ultimate settlement and timing cannot be precisely determined in advance.     (c)   This table excludes the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets.   Debt Ratings   We receive debt credit ratings from two of the major rating agencies, which are subject to regular reviews. We believe that each of the rating agencies consider many factors in determining our ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels, asset composition and proved reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing.  34    Table of Contents  Book Capitalization   Our net book capitalization at September 30, 2011 was $4.1 billion, consisting of $51.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, debt of $1.8 billion and stockholder’s equity of $2.3 billion. Our net debt to net book capitalization was 42.7% at September 30, 2011 and 46.9% at December 31, 2010.  Capital Requirements   We currently estimate our 2011 capital spending will approximate $1.47 billion (excluding acquisitions) and based on current projections is expected to be funded with internal cash flow, property sales and our bank credit facility. Acreage purchases during the first nine months include $113.8 million of purchases in the Marcellus Shale, which were funded with borrowings under our bank credit facility and asset sales. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, $957.2 million of our development and exploration spending was funded with internal cash flow, borrowings under our bank credit facility and asset sales. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting the amount up or down and between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may choose to sell assets, issue subordinated notes or other debt securities, or issue additional shares of stock to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions, extend maturities or repay debt.  Other Contingencies   We are involved in various legal actions, claims and other regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. While the outcome of these lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or consolidated financial position. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our net income or loss in the period in which the ruling occurs.  Hedging — Natural Gas and Oil Prices   We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. Historically, these contracts consisted of collars and fixed price swaps. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital program. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. In light of current worldwide economic uncertainties, we have employed a strategy to hedge a portion of our production looking out 12 to 36 months from each quarter. At September 30, 2011, we had open swap contracts covering 25.6 Bcf of natural gas at prices averaging $5.00 and 2.5 million barrels of NGLs (the C5 component) at an average price of $103.00 per barrel. At September 30, 2011, we had collars covering 159.8 Bcf of natural gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $5.24 and $5.87 per mcf and 0.7 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $70.00 and $80.00 per barrel. At September 30, 2011, we also had sold call options covering 2.2 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $83.86. At the time of settlement of these monthly call options, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, we will pay the counterparty such excess and if the market settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from either party. The fair value of all of our derivative contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination, based on a comparison of contract prices and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on September 30, 2011 was a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $183.6 million. The contracts expire monthly through December 2013. Settled transaction gains and losses for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases in natural gas, NGLs and oil sales in the period the hedged production is sold. In the first nine months of 2011, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales included realized hedging gains of $80.7 million compared to gains of $35.2 million in the same period of 2010.  35    Table of Contents   At September 30, 2011, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                  Average   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Hedge Price     Natural Gas               2012    Swaps    70,000 Mmbtu/day    $5.00   2011    Collars    348,200 Mmbtu/day    $5.33 — $6.18   2012    Collars    189,641 Mmbtu/day    $5.32 — $5.91   2013    Collars    160,000 Mmbtu/day    $5.09 — $5.65                   Crude Oil               2012    Collars    2,000 bbls/day    $70.00 — $80.00   2011    Call options    5,500 bbls/day    $80.00   2012    Call options    4,700 bbls/day    $85.00                   NGLs               2011    Swaps    7,000 bbls/day    $104.17   2012    Swaps    5,000 bbls/day    $102.59      Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as a hedge but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas and oil production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value as unrealized derivative gains and losses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts as derivative fair value income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2011, derivatives on 37.2 Bcfe no longer qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting.  Interest Rates   At September 30, 2011, we had $1.8 billion of debt outstanding which bears interest at fixed rates averaging 6.9%.  Inflation and Changes in Prices   Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been, and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. During third quarter 2011, we received an average of $3.61 per mcf of gas and $81.18 per barrel of oil before derivative contracts compared to $3.86 per mcf of gas and $66.74 per barrel of oil in the same period of the prior year. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and accelerated through the middle of 2008, commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly. The higher prices led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on capital costs. Due to the decline in commodity prices since then, costs have generally moderated but are increasing in areas with high levels of drilling activity that utilize specialized services for horizontal drilling and completions. We expect costs in 2011 and 2012 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.  36    Table of Contents     ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposures. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk   Our major market risk is exposure to natural gas, NGL and oil prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Natural gas, NGL and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years.  Commodity Price Risk   We periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our natural gas, oil and NGL production. These arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of natural gas and oil price fluctuations. Some of our derivatives have been swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. We have also entered into call option derivative contracts under which we sold call options in exchange for a premium from the counterparty. Historically, we applied hedge accounting to derivatives utilized to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and oil production. Accordingly, we recorded the change in the fair value of our swap and collar contracts under the balance sheet caption accumulated other comprehensive income and into natural gas, NGLs and oil sales when the forecasted sale of production occurred. Any hedge ineffectiveness associated with contracts qualifying for and designated as a cash flow hedge is reported currently each period in derivative fair value income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGL and oil production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value in unrealized derivative gains and losses in our consolidated balance sheets. We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in derivative fair value income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Our derivative counterparties include ten financial institutions, of which all but one are in our bank group. None of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that would require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date.   As of September 30, 2011, we had swaps covering 25.6 Bcf of natural gas and 2.5 million barrels of NGLs, collars covering 159.8 Bcf of natural gas and 0.7 million barrels of oil and call options for 2.2 million barrels of oil. These contracts expire monthly through December 2013. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of September 30, 2011, approximated a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $183.6 million.   We expect our NGL production to continue to increase. In the first nine months 2011, we entered into NGL swap contracts for the natural gasoline component (C5) of NGLs. In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGL production and we believe NGL prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the percentage of NGL prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand.  37    Table of Contents   At September 30, 2011, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                          Fair Market Value                   as of                   September 30, 2011   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Average Hedge Price   Asset (Liability)                   (in thousands)     Natural Gas                   2012    Swaps    70,000 Mmbtu/day    $5.00    $ 19,304   2011    Collars    348,200 Mmbtu/day    $5.33 — $6.18    $ 48,376   2012    Collars    189,641 Mmbtu/day    $5.32 — $5.91    $ 77,664   2013    Collars    160,000 Mmbtu/day    $5.09 — $5.65    $ 26,461                       Crude Oil                   2012    Collars    2,000 bbls/day    $70.00 — $80.00    $ (4,340)   2011    Call options    5,500 bbls/day    $80.00    $ (2,945)   2012    Call options    4,700 bbls/day    $85.00    $ (17,792)                       NGLs                   2011    Swaps    7,000 bbls/day    $104.17    $ 8,186   2012    Swaps    5,000 bbls/day    $102.59    $ 28,695     Other Commodity Risk   We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. We currently have not entered into any basis derivatives.   The following table shows the fair value of our swaps, collars and call options and the hypothetical change in the fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at September 30, 2011 (in thousands):                                                              Hypothetical Change in     Hypothetical Change in                 Fair Value     Fair Value                 Increase of     Decrease of         Fair Value     10%     25%     10%     25%       Swaps   $ 56,185     $ (32,340 )   $ (80,720 )   $ 32,335     $ 80,840     Collars     148,161       (67,327 )     (164,444 )     68,901       175,182     Call options     (20,737 )     (10,419 )     (29,456 )     8,094       15,824          ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2011 at the reasonable assurance level.  38    Table of Contents  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  39    Table of Contents     PART II — OTHER INFORMATION     ITEM 1A.
