Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. The three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2008 have been adjusted for certain immaterial amounts. See also Note 2 of this report.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. These policies and estimates are described in the 2008 Form 10-K except as updated below. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: accounting for oil and gas revenue, oil and gas properties, stock-based compensation, derivative financial instruments, asset retirement obligations and deferred taxes.   We adhere to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932 “Extractive Activities — Oil and Gas,” for recognizing impairment of capitalized costs related to unproved properties. These costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated (at least quarterly) as to recoverability based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management. We also consider time, geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs. We continue to experience an increase in lease expirations and impairment expense caused by (1) current economic conditions, which have impacted our future drilling plans thereby increasing the amount of expected lease expirations, and (2) the rapid expansion of our unproved property positions in new shale plays. As economic conditions change and we continue to evaluate unproved properties, our estimates of expirations likely will change and we may increase or decrease impairment expense. We recorded abandonment and impairment expense in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 of $24.1 million and $84.6 million compared to $5.1 million and $10.7 million in the same periods of the prior year.  Results of Continuing Operations  Overview   Total revenues declined $419.0 million, or 67% for third quarter 2009 over the same period of 2008. The decrease includes a $273.4 million decrease in derivative fair value (loss) income and a $145.6 million decrease in oil and gas sales. Oil and gas sales vary due to changes in volumes of production sold and realized commodity prices. Due to volatility in oil and gas prices, realized prices dropped sharply from the same period of the prior year, which was partially offset by an increase in production. For third quarter 2009, production increased 13% from the same period of the prior year while realized prices declined 30%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, production also increased 13% from the same period of the prior year while realized prices declined 31%. We believe oil and gas prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new regulations, new technology, and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide.   Despite a 13% increase in production volumes, oil and gas sales declined 42% when compared to the same period in the prior year. The oil and gas commodity price decline, which began during the second half of 2008, has continued through the first nine months of 2009, especially with regard to natural gas prices. However, signs of possible economic improvement have recently resulted in higher oil prices and a slight increase in natural gas prices. With the lower commodity price environment, we have focused our efforts on improving our operating efficiency. These efforts resulted in 25% lower direct operating expense per mcfe for the third quarter and 16% lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 when compared to the same periods of the prior year. However, as we continue to expand our Marcellus Shale team to meet the needs of this developing asset, we have seen upward pressure on our general and administrative costs per mcfe. To mitigate this trend, we have announced the closing of our Gulf Coast business unit office in Houston, Texas, effective November 1, 2009. The operations will be combined with and operated out of our Southwestern Area office in Fort Worth. We also continue to see higher fixed interest expense per mcfe due to the issuances of new fixed rate senior subordinated notes at higher interest rates than our floating rate bank credit facility.  22    Table of Contents  Oil and Gas Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculation   Our oil and gas sales vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and volumes of production sold. Hedges included in oil and gas sales reflect settlement on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Cash settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in the consolidated statement of operations caption called “Derivative fair value income (loss).” The following table summarizes the primary components of oil and gas sales for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2009     2008     Change     %     2009     2008     Change     %                                                                           Oil wellhead   $ 33,869     $ 86,506     $ (52,637 )     (61 %)   $ 101,892     $ 257,640     $ (155,748 )     (60 %)   Oil hedges realized     240       (28,003 )     28,243       101 %     12,247       (76,428 )     88,675       116 %                                                           Total oil sales     34,109       58,503       (24,394 )     (42 %)     114,139       181,212       (67,073 )     (37 %)                                                                                                                               Gas wellhead     97,004       282,243       (185,239 )     (66 %)     300,646       775,813       (475,167 )     (61 %)   Gas hedges realized     54,122       (13,188 )     67,310       510 %     146,594       (9,540 )     156,134       1,637 %                                                           Total gas sales     151,126       269,055       (117,929 )     (44 %)     447,240       766,273       (319,033 )     (42 %)                                                                                                                               NGL     16,887       20,162       (3,275 )     (16 %)     36,455       55,241       (18,786 )     (34 %)                                                                                                                               Combined wellhead     147,760       388,911       (241,151 )     (62 %)     438,993       1,088,694       (649,701 )     (60 %)   Combined hedges     54,362       (41,191 )     95,553       232 %     158,841       (85,968 )     244,809       285 %                                                           Total oil and gas sales   $ 202,122     $ 347,720     $ (145,598 )     (42 %)   $ 597,834     $ 1,002,726     $ (404,892 )     (40 %)                                                              Our production continues to grow through continued drilling success as we place new wells into production. For third quarter 2009, our production volumes increased, from the same period of the prior year, 32% in our Appalachian Area, 4% in our Southwestern Area and decreased 33% in our Gulf Coast Area. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, our production volumes increased, from the same period of the prior year, 23% in our Appalachia Area, 8% in our Southwestern Area and decreased 11% in our Gulf Coast Area. Crude oil production declined primarily due to the sale of certain oil properties in West Texas effective June 30, 2009. Our production for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 is shown below:                                                                              Three Months Ended   Nine Months Ended       September 30,   September 30,       2009   2008   Change   %   2009   2008   Change   %     Production:                                                                   Crude oil (bbls)     534,399       759,449       (225,050 )     (30 %)     1,987,603       2,343,138       (355,535 )     (15 %)   NGLs (bbls)     543,005       345,635       197,370       57 %     1,492,259       993,366       498,893       50 %   Natural gas (mcf)     33,747,972       29,053,832       4,694,140       16 %     96,205,898       84,029,611       12,176,287       14 %   Total (mcfe)(a)     40,212,396       35,684,336       4,528,060       13 %     117,085,070       104,048,635       13,036,435       13 %                                                                       Average daily production:                                                                   Crude oil (bbls)     5,809       8,255       (2,446 )     (30 %)     7,281       8,552       (1,271 )     (15 %)   NGLs (bbls)     5,902       3,757       2,145       57 %     5,466       3,625       1,841       51 %   Natural gas (mcf)     366,826       315,803       51,023       16 %     352,403       306,677       45,726       15 %   Total (mcfe)(a)     437,091       387,873       49,218       13 %     428,883       379,740       49,143       13 %                (a)   Oil and NGLs are converted at the rate of one barrel equals six mcfe.   23    Table of Contents   Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements) received for oil and gas was $6.35 per mcfe in third quarter 2009 compared to $9.02 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year.

Derivative fair value (loss) income is a loss of $482,000 in third quarter 2009 compared to income of $272.9 million in the same period of 2008. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and gas production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. All unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in the consolidated statement of operations caption “Derivative fair value income (loss).” We have also entered into basis swap agreements, which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are also marked to market. Not using hedge accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from non-hedge derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in our balance sheet caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in this statement of operations category, is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Codification.  24    Table of Contents   The following table presents information about the components of derivative fair value income (loss) for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2009     2008     2009     2008                                           Hedge ineffectiveness — realized(c)   $ 1,581     $ (213 )   $ 3,159     $ 2     — unrealized(a)     (386 )     4,553       (483 )     1,862     Change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting(a)     (53,323 )     294,317       (83,393 )     (3,184 )   Realized gain (loss) on settlements — gas(b)(c)     51,619       (18,520 )     138,361       (30,192 )   Realized gain (loss) on settlements — oil(b)(c)     27       (7,268 )     7,565       (16,070 )                               Derivative fair value (loss) income   $ (482 )   $ 272,869     $ 65,209     $ (47,582 )                                            (a)   These amounts are unrealized and are not included in average sales price calculations.

Other revenue for third quarter 2009 decreased to a loss of $443,000 compared to income of $544,000 in the same period of 2008. Third quarter 2009 includes a loss from equity method investments of $1.0 million compared to income of $151,000 in the same period of the prior year. Other revenue for the first nine months of 2009 decreased to a loss of $6.6 million from a gain of $20.8 million in the same period of the prior year. The first nine months of 2009 includes a loss from equity method investments of $6.5 million. The first nine months of 2008 includes a gain on the sale of certain East Texas properties of $20.1 million.   We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about these expenses on an mcfe basis for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008:                                                                              Three Months Ended   Nine Months Ended       September 30,   September 30,       2009   2008   Change   %   2009   2008   Change   %                                                                         Direct operating expense   $ 0.77     $ 1.02     $ (0.25 )     (25 %)   $ 0.87     $ 1.03     $ (0.16 )     (16 %)   Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.19       0.43       (0.24 )     (56 %)     0.20       0.43       (0.23 )     (53 %)   General and administrative expense     0.76       0.69       0.07       10 %     0.72       0.63       0.09       14 %   Interest expense     0.76       0.71       0.05       7 %     0.74       0.70       0.04       6 %   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     2.42       2.15       0.27       13 %     2.31       2.10       0.21       10 %      Direct operating expense declined $5.4 million in third quarter 2009 to $31.1 million. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties. In the third quarter 2009, this effect was more than offset by lower overall industry costs, lower workovers and asset sales. On an absolute dollar basis, our spending for direct operating expense (excluding workovers) is virtually unchanged for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 despite higher production levels, due to cost containment measures and lower overall industry costs. We incurred $2.7 million ($0.07 per mcfe) of workover costs in third quarter 2009 versus $3.7 million ($0.10 per mcfe) in 2008. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses for third quarter 2009 decreased $0.25 or 25% from the same period of 2008 with the decrease consisting primarily of lower workover costs ($0.03 per mcfe) and lower utility costs ($0.04 per mcfe) and lower well service costs. Direct operating expense was $101.5 million in the first nine months of 2009 compared to $106.7 million in the same period of the prior year. We incurred $5.3 million ($0.05 per mcfe) of workover costs in the first nine months of 2009 versus $9.1 million ($0.09 per mcfe) in 2008. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses for the first nine months of 2009 decreased $0.16 or 16% from the same time period of 2008 with the decrease consisting primarily of lower workover costs ($0.04 per mcfe), lower utility costs ($0.02 per mcfe) and lower well service costs. Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008:  25    Table of Contents                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2009     2008     Change     %     2009     2008     Change     %                                                                           Lease operating expense   $ 0.68     $ 0.90     $ (0.22 )     (24 %)   $ 0.80     $ 0.92     $ (0.12 )     (13 %)   Workovers     0.07       0.10       (0.03 )     (30 %)     0.05       0.09       (0.04 )     (44 %)   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.02       0.02       —       — %     0.02       0.02       —       — %                                                           Total direct operating expenses   $ 0.77     $ 1.02     $ (0.25 )     (25 %)   $ 0.87     $ 1.03     $ (0.16 )     (16 %)                                                              Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. For the third quarter, these taxes decreased $7.6 million or 50% from the same period of the prior year due to the significant decline in wellhead prices. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes decreased to $0.19 in third quarter 2009 from $0.43 in the same period of 2008 primarily due to a 66% decrease in pre-hedge prices. For the first nine months of 2009, these taxes decreased $21.7 million or 48% from the same period of the prior year due to the significant decline in pre-hedge prices, which declined 64%.  General and administrative expense for third quarter 2009 increased $5.9 million from the same period of the prior year due primarily to higher salaries and benefits ($2.4 million) reflecting salary increases and an increase in the number of employees as we continue the expansion of our Marcellus Shale team, higher stock-based compensation ($2.0 million) and higher office expenses, including rent and information technology. Third quarter 2009 also includes $840,000 ($0.02 per mcfe) accrued severance costs related to the closing of our Houston office and $1.1 million ($0.03 per mcfe) bad debt expense. We have increased our employee count by 3% from September 2008. General and administrative expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 increased $18.6 million or 28% from the same period of the prior year due primarily to higher salaries and benefits ($10.3 million), higher stock-based compensation ($5.6 million) and higher office expenses, including rent costs and an increase in legal expenses. Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008:                                                                             Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2009     2008     Change     %     2009     2008     Change     %                                                                           General and administrative   $ 0.57     $ 0.53     $ 0.04       8 %   $ 0.53     $ 0.47     $ 0.06       13 %   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.19       0.16       0.03       19 %     0.19       0.16       0.03       19 %                                                           Total general and administrative expenses   $ 0.76     $ 0.69     $ 0.07       10 %   $ 0.72     $ 0.63     $ 0.09       14 %                                                              Interest expense for third quarter 2009 increased $5.3 million from the same period of the prior year to $30.6 million due to the refinancing of certain debt from floating to higher fixed rates combined with higher overall debt balances. In May 2009, we issued $300.0 million of 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019, which added $6.0 million of interest costs in third quarter 2009. The proceeds from the issuance were used to retire lower floating interest rate bank debt, to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for third quarter 2009 was $430.7 million compared to $384.6 million for the same period of the prior year and the weighted average interest rates were 2.2% in third quarter 2009 compared to 4.3% in the same period of the prior year. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 increased $14.5 million or 20% also due to the refinancing of certain debt from floating to higher fixed rates and higher overall debt balances. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for the first nine months of 2009 was $644.5 million compared to $425.5 million for the first nine months of 2008 and the weighted average interest rate was 2.5% in the first nine months 2009 compared to 4.7% in the same period of 2008.  Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) increased $20.5 million, or 27%, to $97.2 million in third quarter 2009 with a 13% increase in production and an 12% increase in depletion rates. On a per mcfe basis, DD&A increased from $2.15 in third quarter 2008 to $2.42 in third quarter 2009. In the first nine months of 2009, DD&A increased $51.3 million to $270.2 million with a 13% increase in production and an 9% increase in depletion rates. The increase in DD&A per mcfe is primarily due to significant early stage exploratory and development costs associated with our shale plays and the mix of our production. We generally adjust our D,D&A rates in the fourth quarter of each year. The following table summarizes DD&A expenses per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008: 26    Table of Contents                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2009     2008     Change     %     2009     2008     Change     %                                                                           Depletion and amortization   $ 2.26     $ 2.01     $ 0.25       12 %   $ 2.15     $ 1.97     $ 0.18       9 %   Depreciation     0.12       0.11       0.01       9 %     0.12       0.10       0.02       20 %   Accretion and other     0.04       0.03       0.01       33 %     0.04       0.04       —       — %                                                           Total DD&A expense   $ 2.42     $ 2.15     $ 0.27       13 %   $ 2.31     $ 2.11     $ 0.20       9 %                                                              Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties and deferred compensation plan expenses. In the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, stock-based compensation represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and expenses related to SAR grants. In third quarter 2009, stock-based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($798,000), exploration expense ($979,000) and general and administrative expense ($7.5 million) for a total of $9.5 million. In third quarter 2008, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($762,000), exploration expense ($1.0 million) and general and administrative expense ($5.5 million) for a total of $7.4 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2009, stock-based compensation is a component of directing operating expense ($2.4 million), exploration expense ($2.9 million) and general and administrative expense ($22.7 million) for a total of $28.7 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2008, stock based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($2.1 million) exploration expense ($3.1 million) and general and administrative expense ($17.1 million) for a total of $22.6 million.   Exploration expense decreased $8.0 million in third quarter 2009 primarily due to lower seismic costs. Exploration expense declined $19.4 million in the first nine months 2009 due to lower dry hole and seismic costs. The following table details our exploration-related expenses for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2009     2008     Change     %     2009     2008     Change     %                                                                           Dry hole expense   $ 212     $ 81     $ 131       162 %   $ 343     $ 9,337     $ (8,994 )     (96 %)   Seismic     6,267       14,090       (7,823 )     (56 %)     20,182       30,616       (10,434 )     (34 %)   Personnel expense     2,727       2,736       (9 )     — %     8,432       8,291       141       2 %   Stock-based compensation expense     979       1,020       (41 )     (4 %)     2,933       3,128       (195 )     (6 %)   Delay rentals and other     917       1,222       (304 )     (25 %     3,919       3,832       88       2 %                                                           Total exploration expense   $ 11,102     $ 19,149     $ (8,046 )     (42 %)   $ 35,809     $ 55,204     $ (19,394 )     (35 %)                                                              Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties expense was $24.1 million and $84.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009 as compared to $5.1 million and $10.7 million during the same respective periods of 2008. In the first nine months of 2009, abandonment and impairment expense of $84.6 million includes the expiration of certain Barnett Shale leases. We continue to experience increases in lease expirations and impairment expenses caused by (1) current economic conditions, which have impacted our future drilling plans thereby increasing the amount of expected lease expirations and (2) the expansion of our unproved property positions in new shale plays.   Deferred compensation plan expense was $16.4 million in the third quarter 2009 compared to income of $37.5 million in the same period of the prior year. Our stock price increased from $41.41 at June 30, 2009 to $49.36 at September 30, 2009. During the same period in the prior year, our stock price decreased from $65.54 at June 30, 2008 to $42.87 at September 30, 2008. This non-cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in the deferred compensation plan. Our deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Deferred compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $29.6 million compared to income of $9.4 million in the same period of the prior year. Our stock price increased from $34.39 at December 31, 2008 to $49.36 at September 30, 2009. During the same nine-month period of 2008, our stock price decreased from $51.36 at December 31, 2007 to $42.87 at September 30, 2008.   Income tax (benefit) expense for third quarter 2009 decreased to a benefit of $15.3 million from expense of $172.6 million in third quarter 2008, reflecting a 110% decrease in income from operations before taxes compared to the same period of 2008. Third quarter 2009 provided for a tax benefit at an effective rate of 33.9% compared to tax expense at an effective rate of 37.7% in the same period of 2008. Current income taxes in third quarter 2009 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 are related to state income taxes and include a $1.0 million federal income tax refund. Income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, decreased from an expense of $156.8 million to a benefit of $19.0 million reflecting a 114% decline in income from operations before taxes when compared to the same period of 2008. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36% for 2009.  27    Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with both uncommitted and committed availability, asset sales and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. In a continuing effort to mitigate the effect of the deterioration in the capital markets and the decline in oil and gas commodity prices, which began in mid 2008, we have taken additional measures during the first nine months of 2009 to enhance our liquidity. In May 2009 we issued $300.0 million of 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019 at a discount. We used the $285.2 million of proceeds received from the issuance of the 8.0% senior subordinated notes to repay outstanding bank debt, increasing the availability of our credit line. Also in 2009, we entered into commodity derivative contracts covering 61.9 Bcf for the 2010 year at weighted average floor and cap prices of $5.50 to $7.47 per mcfe to protect our cash flow. We also sold certain West Texas oil properties for proceeds of $182.0 million with the proceeds used to repay outstanding bank debt. We currently estimate our 2009 capital spending will approximate $740.0 million, excluding acquisitions, which incorporates significantly reduced spending in all areas except our Marcellus Shale play. As part of our semi-annual bank review completed September 30, 2009, our borrowing base and facility amounts were reaffirmed at $1.5 billion and $1.25 billion.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, our cash provided from operating activities was $443.8 million and we spent $447.3 million on capital expenditures and $118.7 million of acreage purchases. We sold certain West Texas oil properties for proceeds of $182.0 million. At September 30, 2009, we had $859,000 in cash, total assets of $5.4 billion and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 42.8%. Long-term debt at September 30, 2009 totaled $1.8 billion including $398.0 million of bank credit facility debt and $1.4 billion of senior subordinated notes. Available committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility at September 30, 2009 was $852.0 million.   Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves, which is typical in the capital-intensive oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. Sustained lower oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We currently have approximately 48% of our 2010 production subject to hedging agreements. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices, which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.   Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Credit Arrangements   On September 30, 2009, the bank credit facility had a $1.5 billion borrowing base and a $1.25 billion facility amount. The borrowing base represents an amount approved by the bank group that can be borrowed based on our assets, while our $1.25 billion facility amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the credit agreement. The bank credit facility provides for a borrowing base subject to redeterminations semi-annually each April and October and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. Remaining credit availability is $829.0 million on October 20, 2009. Our bank group is comprised of twenty-six commercial banks, with no one bank holding more than 5.0% of the bank credit facility. We believe our large number of banks and relatively low hold levels allow for significant lending capacity should we elect to increase our $1.25 billion commitment up to the $1.5 billion borrowing base and also allow for flexibility should there be additional consolidation within the banking sector.  28    Table of Contents   Our bank credit facility and our indentures governing our senior subordinated notes all contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, enter into hedging contracts change the nature of our business or operations, merge or consolidate or make certain investments. In addition, we are required to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0 and a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2009. Please see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.  Cash Flow   Cash flows from operations primarily are affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operating activities also are impacted by changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our oil and gas production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. However, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12 to 24 months. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowing under the credit facility. As of September 30, 2009, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 27.4 Bcfe for 2009 and 61.9 Bcfe for 2010.   Net cash provided from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $443.8 million compared to $600.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2008. Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2009 was lower than same period of the prior year, as higher production from development activity was more than offset by lower prices. Net cash provided from continuing operations is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows) in the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was a negative $11.1 million compared to a negative $45.8 million in the same period of the prior year.   Net cash used in investing for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $385.1 million compared to $1.4 billion in the same period of 2008. The first nine months of 2009 included $425.4 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $118.7 million of acreage purchases offset by proceeds of $182.2 million from asset sales. Acquisitions for the first nine months of 2009 include the purchase of certain Marcellus Shale leasehold acreage for $77.4 million and Barnett Shale acreage for $14.1 million. The first nine months of 2008 included $646.4 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $805.4 million of acreage purchases and other investments, offset by proceeds of $66.7 million from asset sales.   Net cash used in financing for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was $58.6 million compared to net cash provided from financing activities of $783.6 million in the first nine months of 2008. The prior year included net proceeds from a public stock offering of $282.2 million. In the first nine months of 2009, we borrowed $582.0 million under our bank credit facility compared to borrowings of $1.2 billion in the same period of the prior year. During the first nine months of 2009, total debt decreased $9.2 million. In the first nine months of 2008, total debt increased $496.8 million.  Dividends   On September 1, 2009, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.3 million) on our common stock, which was paid on September 30, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 15, 2009.  Capital Requirements, Contractual Cash Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   We currently estimate our 2009 capital spending will approximate $740.0 million (excluding proved property acquisitions) and based on current projections, is expected to be funded with internal cash flow and property sales. We may, from time to time during 2009, make borrowings under our credit facility but expect that for all of 2009 to require no significant incremental borrowing from ending 2008 levels. Acreage purchases during the year include $77.4 million of purchases in the Marcellus Shale and $14.1 million in the Barnett Shale which were funded with borrowings under the credit facility. In addition, in second and third quarter 2009, we issued 474,572 shares of stock to purchase $20.5 million of additional Marcellus acreage. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, $453.1 million of development and exploration spending was funded with internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting the amount up or down and between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may sell assets, issue subordinated notes or other debt securities, or issue additional shares of stock to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions, extend maturities or repay debt.  29    Table of Contents   Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, transportation commitments and other liabilities. Since December 31, 2008, the material changes to our contractual obligations included the issuance of $300.0 million of 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019 and an increase in our transportation commitments (see table and discussion below).   We have entered into firm transportation contracts with various pipelines. Under these contracts, we are obligated to transport minimum daily gas volumes, as calculated on a monthly basis, or pay for any deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate. As of September 30, 2009, future minimum transportation fees under our gas transportation commitments were as follows (in thousands):                    2009 remaining   $ 8,891     2010     34,663     2011     34,180     2012     31,220     2013     30,349     2014     27,070     Thereafter     207,240                   $ 373,613                 Other Contingencies   We are involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or consolidated financial position.  Hedging — Oil and Gas Prices   We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. These contracts consist of collars and fixed price swaps. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital program. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. In light of current worldwide economic uncertainties, we recently have employed a strategy to hedge a portion of our production looking out 12 to 15 months from each quarter. At September 30, 2009, we had open swap contracts covering 7.1 Bcf of gas at prices averaging $8.16 per mcf. We also have collars covering 78.9 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $5.96 and $7.70 per mcf and 0.6 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $63.43 and $76.01 per barrel. Their fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination, based on a comparison of contract prices and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on September 30, 2009 was a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $80.5 million. The contracts expire monthly through December 2010. Settled transaction gains and losses for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases in oil and gas sales in the period the hedged production is sold. In the first nine months of 2009, oil and gas sales included realized hedging gains of $158.8 million compared to losses of $86.0 million in the first nine months of 2008.   At September 30, 2009, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                                      Average   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Hedge Price                                 Natural Gas                           2009   Swaps   76,739 Mmbtu/day   $ 8.16     2009   Collars   184,837 Mmbtu/day   $ 7.64-$8.53     2010   Collars   169,671 Mmbtu/day   $ 5.50-$7.47                                 Crude Oil                           2009   Collars   6,000 bbl/day   $ 63.43-$76.01        Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and gas production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value on our balance sheet under the captions “Unrealized derivative gains and losses.” We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in our consolidated statement of operations caption called “Derivative fair value income (loss).” As of September 30, 2009, derivatives on 21.7 Bcfe no longer qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting.  30    Table of Contents   In addition to the swaps and collars above, we have entered into basis swap agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market. The price we receive for our production can be less than NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a net unrealized pre-tax loss of $16.9 million at September 30, 2009.  Interest Rates   At September 30, 2009, we had $1.8 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.4 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.4%. Bank debt totaling $398.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 2.2% at September 30, 2009. The 30-day LIBOR rate on September 30, 2009 was 0.2%.  Debt Ratings   We receive debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, Inc. (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”), which are subject to regular reviews. S&P’s rating for us is BB with a stable outlook. Moody’s rating for us is Ba2 with a stable outlook. We believe that S&P and Moody’s consider many factors in determining our ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels, asset, and proved reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing.  Inflation and Changes in Prices   Our revenues, the value of our assets, our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Oil and gas prices are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. During third quarter 2009, we received an average of $63.38 per barrel of oil and $2.87 per mcf of gas before derivative contracts compared to $113.91 per barrel of oil and $9.72 per mcf of gas in the same period of the prior year. During the first nine months of 2009, we received an average of $51.26 per barrel of oil and $3.13 per mcf of gas before derivative contracts compared to $109.95 per barrel and $9.23 per mcf in the first nine months of the prior year. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and continued through the first six months of 2008, commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly. The higher prices led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on capital costs. The last half of 2008 and the first nine months of 2009 we have experienced declines in commodity prices and while we have realized some cost savings, operating costs have not decreased at the same rate as commodity prices. We expect to see further cost reductions in 2009 but we are uncertain how quickly costs will decline and by how much.  Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted   In December 2008, the SEC announced that it had approved revisions to its oil and gas reporting disclosures. The new disclosure requirements include provisions that:       •   Introduce a new definition of oil and gas producing activities. This new definition allows companies to include in their reserve base volumes from unconventional resources. Such unconventional resources include bitumen extracted from oil sands and oil and gas extracted from coal beds and shale formations.        •   Require companies to report oil and gas reserves using an unweighted average price using the prior 12-month period, based on the closing prices on the first day of each month, rather than year-end prices. The SEC indicated they will continue to communicate with the FASB staff to align FASB’s accounting standards with these rules. The FASB currently requires a single-day, year-end price for accounting purposes.        •   Permit companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves on a voluntary basis. In the past, proved reserves were the only reserves allowed in the disclosures.        •   Require companies to provide additional disclosure regarding the aging of proved undeveloped reserves.        •   Permit the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes.        •   Replace the existing “certainty” test for areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a productive well with a “reasonable certainty” test.    31    Table of Contents      •   Require additional disclosures regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the company’s overall reserve estimation process. Additionally, disclosures regarding internal controls over reserve estimation, as well as a report addressing the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor will be mandatory.     We will begin complying with the disclosure requirements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. The new rules may not be applied to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required. We are currently in the process of evaluating the new requirements.  32    Table of Contents     Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposures. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Financial Market Risk   The debt and equity markets have exhibited adverse conditions since late 2007. The unprecedented volatility and upheaval in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets. At this point, we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent events in the global markets and we do not expect our liquidity to be materially impacted in the near future. We will continue to monitor our liquidity and the capital markets. Additionally, we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our twenty-six lenders in the bank credit facility.  Market Risk   Our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years.  Commodity Price Risk   We periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production. These arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. Certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. Historically, we applied hedge accounting to derivatives utilized to manage price risk associated with our oil and gas production. Accordingly, we recorded change in the fair value of our swap and collar contracts under the balance sheet caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” and into oil and gas sales when the forecasted sale of production occurred. Any hedge ineffectiveness associated with contracts qualifying for and designated as a cash flow hedge is reported currently each period under our consolidated statement of operations caption “Derivative fair value income (loss).” Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and gas production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet under the captions “Unrealized derivative gains and losses.” We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in our consolidated statement of operations under the caption “Derivative fair value income (loss).” Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Our derivative counterparties include thirteen financial institutions, eleven of which are in our bank group. Mitsui & Co. and J. Aron & Company are the two counterparties not in our bank group. At September 30, 2009, our net derivative asset includes a payable to J. Aron & Company of $965,000 and a receivable from Mitsui & Co. for $4.9 million. None of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that would require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date.   As of September 30, 2009, we had swaps in place covering 7.1 Bcf of gas. We also had collars covering 78.9 Bcf of gas and 0.6 million barrels of oil. These contracts expire monthly through December 2010. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of September 30, 2009, approximated a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $80.5 million.  33    Table of Contents   At September 30, 2009, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                          Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Average Hedge Price   Fair Market Value                               (in thousands)     Natural Gas                                   2009   Swaps   76,739 Mmbtu/day   $ 8.16     $ 24,698     2009   Collars   184,837 Mmbtu/day   $ 7.64-$8.53     $ 51,011     2010   Collars   169,671 Mmbtu/day   $ 5.50-$7.47     $ 5,362                                         Crude Oil                                   2009   Collars   6,000 bbl/day   $ 63.43-$76.01     $ (618 )     Other Commodity Risk   We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. In addition to the collars and swaps detailed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements, which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market. The price we receive for our gas production can be less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a net realized pre-tax loss of $16.9 million at September 30, 2009.   The following table shows the fair value of our swaps and collars and the hypothetical change in the fair value that would result from a 10% change in commodity prices at September 30, 2009. The hypothetical change in fair value would be a gain or loss depending on whether prices increase or decrease (in thousands):                                      Hypothetical Change       Fair Value   in Fair Value                         Swaps   $ 24,698     $ 3,300     Collars   $ 55,755     $ 34,000        Interest rate risk. At September 30, 2009, we had $1.8 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.4 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.4%. Senior bank debt totaling $398.0 million bore interest at floating rates averaging 2.2%. A 1% increase or decrease in short-term interest rates would affect interest expense by approximately $4.0 million per year.     Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2009 at the reasonable assurance level.  34    Table of Contents     PART II — OTHER INFORMATION     Item 6.
