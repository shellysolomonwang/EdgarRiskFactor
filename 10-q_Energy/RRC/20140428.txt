Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2014. Overview of Our Business We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company primarily engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian and Southwestern regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area.Our objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect:—the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures;—our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; and—the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce.We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities.Market Conditions Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for commodities are inherently volatile. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGL composite price for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,         2014     2013     Average NYMEX prices (a)                   Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 4.89     $ 3.35     Oil (per bbl)   $ 98.61     $ 94.25     Mont Belvieu NGL Composite (per gallon)   $ 0.91     $ 0.78    (a) Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices. Consolidated Results of Operations Overview of First Quarter 2014 Results During first quarter 2014, we achieved the following financial and operating results: —increased revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil by 44% from the same period of 2013; 23 —achieved 21% production growth over the same period of 2013; —continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania by growing production, proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage; —excluding workovers, our direct operating expenses per mcfe remained flat from the same period of 2013;—reduced our depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) rate 8% over the same period of 2013; —entered into additional derivative contracts for 2014, 2015 and 2016; and —realized $181.2 million of cash flow from operating activities. Our first quarter 2014 net income was $32.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share compared to a net loss of $75.6 million, or a loss of $0.47 per diluted common share in the same period 2013. During first quarter 2014, we had an increase in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil driven by higher production volumes of 21%. Our first quarter 2014 production growth was due to the continued success of our drilling program, particularly in the Marcellus Shale. First quarter 2014 production for NGLs increased 137% from the same period of 2013 due to our sales of ethane based on our new ethane sales/transport agreements which commenced initial deliveries in late 2013. When comparing first quarter 2014 to the same period of 2013, we also experienced a favorable increase in our non-cash mark-to-market related to our deferred compensation plans along with favorable non-cash fair value adjustments on our commodity derivatives, a non-GAAP measure and lower general and administrative expense, all of which were somewhat offset by lower realized prices. Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials. Average natural gas differentials were $0.66 per mcf above NYMEX in the first quarter 2014 compared to $0.15 per mcf above NYMEX in the same quarter 2013. This increase was more than offset by realized losses on our basis hedging in the first quarter 2014 of $0.90 per mcfe.We believe natural gas, NGLs and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new technology and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for the remainder of 2014 and for 2015 and 2016, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices that we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future. Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices, production volumes and the value of certain of our derivative contracts. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales include netback arrangements where we sell natural gas and oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. In this instance, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. Revenues are also realized from sales arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at a specific delivery point and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation deduction. Third party transportation costs we incur to get our commodity to the delivery point are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense. Hedges included in natural gas, NGLs and oil sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting. Cash settlements and changes in the market value of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in derivative fair value income or loss in the statement of operations. For more information on revenues from derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges, see the derivative fair value loss discussion below. Effective March 1, 2013, we elected to de-designate all commodity contracts that were previously designated as cash flow hedges and elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 24 In first quarter 2014, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 44% compared to the same period of 2013 with a 21% increase in production and a 19% increase in realized prices. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate sales for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):        Three Months Ended March 31,         2014     2013     Change   % Change     Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                 Gas wellhead   $ 346,226     $ 217,088     $ 129,138     59 %   Gas hedges realized (a)     1,168       35,478        (34,310 )    (97 %)   Total gas revenue   $ 347,394     $ 252,566     $ 94,828     38 %   Total NGLs revenue   $  135,504     $ 67,571     $  67,933     101 %   Oil and condensate wellhead   $  88,121     $ 77,080     $  11,041     14 %   Oil hedges realized (a)     998       1,022       (24 )    (2 %)   Total oil and condensate revenue   $  89,119     $ 78,102     $ 11,017     14 %   Combined wellhead   $  569,851     $ 361,739     $ 208,112     58 %   Combined hedges (a)      2,166       36,500       (34,334 )    (94 %)   Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales   $  572,017     $ 398,239     $ 173,778     44 %  (a) Cash settlements related to derivatives that qualified or were historically designated for hedge accounting. Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production partially offset by the natural decline of our natural gas and oil wells and asset sales. When compared to the same period of 2013, our first quarter 2014 production volumes increased 25% in our Appalachian region and decreased 5% in our Southwestern region. When compared to the same period of 2013, our Marcellus production volumes increased 29% for the first quarter. The decline in natural gas production volumes is primarily related to the increased sales of ethane, the extraction of which reduces natural gas volumes to be sold and, to a lesser extent, adverse weather conditions during first quarter 2014. Ethane production volumes are reported with NGLs in the table below. Our production for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 is set forth in the following table:        Three Months Ended March 31,         2014     2013     Change     % Change     Production (a)                                       Natural gas (mcf)     62,017,581       62,023,956        (6,375   )     %       NGLs (bbls)      4,471,481       1,889,424       2,582,057         151 %     Crude oil and condensate (bbls)      1,035,145       912,662        122,483         13 %     Total (mcfe) (b)      95,057,337       78,836,472       16,220,865         21 %     Average daily production (a)                                       Natural gas (mcf)      689,084       689,155        (71   )     %       NGLs (bbls)      49,683       20,994        28,689         137 %     Crude oil and condensate (bbls)      11,502       10,141        1,361         13 %     Total (mcfe) (b)      1,056,193       875,961        180,232         21 %    (a) Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced. (b) Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not necessarily indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices. 25 Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received during first quarter 2014 was $4.14 per mcfe compared to $4.26 per mcfe in the same period of 2013. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualified for hedge accounting. Average sales prices (wellhead) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying statements of operations. Average sales prices (wellhead) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers. Average realized price calculations for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 are shown below:        Three Months EndedMarch 31,         2014     2013     Average Prices                   Average sales prices (wellhead):                   Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 5.58     $ 3.50     NGLs (per bbl)      30.30       35.76     Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)      85.13       84.46     Total (per mcfe) (a)      5.99       4.59     Average realized prices (including derivative settlements that qualified for hedge accounting):           Natural gas (per mcf)   $  5.60     $ 4.07     NGLs (per bbl)     30.30       35.76     Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)      86.09       85.58     Total (per mcfe) (a)      6.02       5.05     Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements):           Natural gas (per mcf)   $  4.20     $ 4.09     NGLs (per bbl)      27.34       35.29     Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)      82.03       85.46     Total (per mcfe) (a)      4.92       5.06     Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range):           Natural gas (per mcf)   $  3.14     $ 3.14     NGLs (per bbl)      25.35       33.61     Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)      82.03       85.46     Total (per mcfe) (a)      4.14       4.26    (a) Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices. Derivative fair value loss was $146.9 million in first quarter 2014 compared to $99.9 million in the same period of 2013. Through February 28, 2013, some of our derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting and were accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value income or loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Effective March 1, 2013, we discontinued hedge accounting prospectively. Since March 1, 2013, all of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment results in volatility of our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. Loss on the sale of assets was $353,000 in first quarter 2014 compared to a loss of $166,000 in the same period of 2013. In first quarter 2014 and 2013, we sold miscellaneous proved and unproved oil and gas properties and inventory for proceeds received of $294,000 in first quarter 2014 compared to $38.2 million in the same period of 2013.Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in first quarter 2014 was $32.5 million compared to $21.0 million in the same period of 2013. The first three months 2014 includes a loss from equity method investments of $133,000 and $33.2 million of revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas. The first three months 2013 includes loss from equity method investments of $80,000 and $21.1 million of revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas. These revenues increased due to an increase in brokered volumes.26 We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:        Three Months Ended March 31,         (per mcfe)         2014     2013     Change     %Change     Direct operating expense   $ 0.42     $ 0.38     $ 0.04       11 %   Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.12       0.14        (0.02 )      (14 %)   General and administrative expense      0.52       1.07        (0.55 )      (51 %)   Interest expense      0.48       0.54        (0.06 )      (11 %)   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense      1.35       1.46        (0.11 )      (8 %)  Direct operating expense was $39.8 million in first quarter 2014 compared to $30.2 million in the same period of 2013. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and manage existing properties. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Our production volumes increased 21% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for first quarter 2014 increased 32% with an increase in the number of producing wells, higher workover costs, higher water handling and winter operations costs somewhat offset by the sale of certain non-core assets at the beginning of second quarter 2013. We incurred $5.6 million of workover costs in first quarter 2014 compared to $1.4 million of workover costs in the same period of 2013. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in first quarter 2014 increased 11% from the same period of 2013 with the increase consisting of higher workover costs. We expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas. However, our operating costs in the Mississippian play are higher on a per mcfe basis than the Marcellus Shale play. As production increases from the Mississippian play, our direct operating expenses per mcfe are expected to increase. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:        Three Months Ended March 31,         (per mcfe)         2014     2013     Change     %Change     Lease operating expense   $ 0.35     $ 0.35     $ ¾       ¾ %   Workovers     0.06       0.02       0.04       200 %   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.01       0.01       ¾       ¾ %   Total direct operating expense   $  0.42     $ 0.38     $ 0.04       11 %  Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee that was initially assessed in 2012. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $5.2 million in first quarter 2014 compared to $4.2 million in the same period of 2013. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) was $0.05 in both first quarter 2014 and first quarter 2013 with an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes more than offset by higher prices. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” on unconventional natural gas and oil production which includes the Marcellus Shale. Included in first quarter 2014 is a $6.5 million impact fee ($0.07 per mcfe) compared to $7.1 million ($0.09 per mcfe) in the same period of the prior year. 27 General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $49.2 million in first quarter 2014 compared to $84.1 million for the same period of 2013. The first quarter 2014 decrease of $34.8 million when compared to 2013 is primarily due to lower lawsuit settlements. The first quarter 2013 included an accrual of $35.0 million related to an Oklahoma lawsuit that was settled in second quarter 2013 for $87.5 million. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and performance shares granted to our employees and non-employee directors as part of compensation. On a per mcfe basis, G&A expense decreased 51% from first quarter 2013 primarily due to the settlement of the Oklahoma lawsuit which was partially accrued in first quarter 2013 and lower salaries and benefits. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:        Three Months Ended March 31,         (per mcfe)         2014     2013     Change     %Change     General and administrative   $ 0.40     $ 0.50     $ (0.10 )      (20 %)   Oklahoma legal settlement     ¾       0.44        (0.44 )     (100 %)   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.12       0.13       (0.01 )     (8 %)   Total general and administrative expenses   $  0.52     $ 1.07       (0.55 )     (51 %)  Interest expense was $45.4 million for first quarter 2014 compared to $42.2 million for first quarter 2013. The following table presents information about interest expense per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:        Three Months Ended March 31,         (per mcfe)         2014     2013     Change     %Change     Bank credit facility   $ 0.05     $ 0.06     $ (0.01 )      (17 %)   Subordinated notes     0.41       0.45        (0.04 )     (9 %)   Amortization of deferred financing costs and other     0.02       0.03       (0.01 )     (33 %)   Total interest expense   $ 0.48     $ 0.54       (0.06 )     (11 %)  On an absolute basis, the increase in interest expense for first quarter 2014 from the same period of 2013 was primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt balances. In March 2013, we issued $750.0 million of 5.0% senior subordinated notes due 2023. We used the proceeds to repay our outstanding bank debt which carries a lower interest rate. We used the proceeds to repay $350.0 million of our outstanding credit facility balance and for general corporate purposes. The 2013 note issuance was undertaken to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for first quarter 2014 was $611.8 million compared to $685.6 million in the same period of 2013 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.0% in first quarter 2014 compared to 2.1% in the same period of 2013. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) was $128.7 million in first quarter 2014 compared to $115.1 million in the same period of 2013. The increase in first quarter 2014 when compared to the same period of 2013 is due to a 7% decrease in depletion rates more than offset by a 21% increase in production. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $1.28 per mcfe in first quarter 2014 compared to $1.38 per mcfe in the same period of 2013. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to our drilling success in the Marcellus Shale. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:        Three Months Ended March 31,         (per mcfe)         2014     2013     Change     %Change     Depletion and amortization   $  1.28     $ 1.38     $  (0.10 )      (7 %)   Depreciation      0.03       0.05        (0.02 )      (40 %)   Accretion and other     0.04       0.03       0.01       33 %   Total DD&A expense   $  1.35     $ 1.46     $  (0.11 )      (8 %)  28 Other Operating Expenses Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, transportation, gathering and compression expense, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties and deferred compensation plan expense. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants, PSUs and SARs grants. The following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation that is allocated to functional expense categories for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):        Three Months EndedMarch 31,         2014     2013     Direct operating expense   $  852     $ 661     Brokered natural gas and marketing expense      528       249     Exploration expense      1,153       1,070     General and administrative expense     11,604       10,306     Total stock-based compensation   $  14,137     $ 12,286    Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $74.2 million in first quarter 2014 compared to $62.4 million in the same period of 2013. These third party costs are higher than 2013 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering, compression and transportation agreements. First quarter 2014 also includes the impact of an ethane transportation contract. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range). Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $34.1 million in first quarter 2014 compared to $22.3 million in the same period of 2013. These costs are higher than 2013 primarily due to an increase in brokered volumes. Exploration expense was $14.8 million in first quarter 2014 compared to $16.8 million in the same period of 2013 due to lower seismic costs and delay rental payments. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):        Three Months Ended March 31,         2014     2013     Change     %Change     Seismic   $ 5,245     $ 7,168     $  (1,923 )      (27 %)   Delay rentals and other      4,094       5,050        (956 )      (19 %)   Personnel expense      4,353       3,651        702       19 %   Stock-based compensation expense      1,153       1,070       83       8 %   Dry hole expense     1       (159 )      160       (101 %)   Total exploration expense   $  14,846     $ 16,780     $  (1,934 )      (12 %)  Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $10.0 million in first quarter 2014 compared to $15.2 million in the same period of 2013. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments will likely be recorded. The decline in first quarter 2014 when compared to the same quarter of 2013 is primarily due to lower expected forfeiture rates in the Marcellus Shale. Deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of $2.0 million in first quarter 2014 compared to a loss of $42.4 million in the same period of 2013. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price decreased from $84.31 at December 31, 2013 to $82.97 at March 31, 2014. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price increased from $62.83 at December 31, 2012 to $81.04 at March 31, 2013. Income tax expense (benefit) was an expense of $19.0 million in first quarter 2014 compared to a benefit of $47.2 million in first quarter 2013. The increase in income taxes in first quarter 2014 reflects a 142% increase in income from operations when 29 compared to the same period of 2013. For the first quarter, the effective tax rate was 36.8% in 2014 compared to 38.4% in 2013. The 2014 and 2013 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, permanent differences and changes in our valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets associated with senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation, which includes distributions from the deferred compensation plan, is expected to exceed the $1.0 million deductible limit provided under section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39% for the remainder of 2014, before any discrete tax items.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash Flow Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and since our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of March 31, 2014, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 234.5 Bcfe for the remainder of 2014, 151.8 Bcfe for 2015 and 22.0 Bcfe for 2016. We have also entered into basis hedges for 254,164 Mmbtu/day through March 2015.Net cash provided from operations in the first three months 2014 was $181.2 million compared to $201.2 million in the same period of 2013. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities from 2013 to 2014 reflects a 21% increase in production offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 3%), higher operating costs and unfavorable working capital. As of March 31, 2014, we have hedged approximately 78% of our projected production for the remainder of 2014, with approximately 89% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first three months 2014 was negative $69.7 million compared to positive $35.8 million for the same period of 2013. The prior year working capital was impacted by a lawsuit settlement accrual of $35.0 million.Net cash used in investing activities from operations in first three months 2014 was $276.2 million compared to $241.0 million in the same period of 2013. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, we: —spent $226.3 million on natural gas and oil property additions; —spent $50.7 million on acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and —received proceeds from asset sales of $294,000. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, we: —spent $259.6 million on natural gas and oil property additions; —spent $8.8 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and —received proceeds from asset sales of $38.2 million. Net cash provided from financing activities in first three months 2014 was $94.9 million compared to $39.7 million in the same period of 2013. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, we: —borrowed $412.0 million and repaid $318.0 million under our bank credit facility, ending the quarter with a $594.0 million outstanding balance on our bank debt. 30 During the three months ended March 31, 2013, we: —borrowed $368.0 million and repaid $1.1 billion under our bank credit facility, ending the quarter with $47.0 million outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility; and—issued $750.0 million principal amount of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2023, at par, with net proceeds of approximately $738.8 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first three months 2014, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2014, 2015 and 2016 to protect future cash flows. On April 3, 2014, our borrowing base and our credit facility amounts were reaffirmed. During first three months 2014, our net cash provided from operating activities of $181.2 million and borrowing under our bank credit facility were used to fund $280.1 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At March 31, 2014, we had $246,000 in cash and total assets of $7.5 billion. Long-term debt at March 31, 2014 totaled $3.2 billion, including $594.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility and $2.6 billion of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at March 31, 2014 was $1.0 billion. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A material drop in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year. Our 2014 capital budget is $1.52 billion. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves. Credit Arrangements As of March 31, 2014, we maintained a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of February 18, 2016. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders semi-annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors but primarily on the lenders’ assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of two thirds of the lenders; increases to the borrowing base require 97% lender approval. On April 3, 2014, the facility amount on our bank credit facility was reaffirmed at $1.75 billion and our borrowing base was reaffirmed at $2.0 billion. Our current bank group is currently composed of twenty-eight financial institutions. Our bank debt and our subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt and our subordinated notes). The debt agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. We are in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2014. Cash Dividend Payments On March 1, 2014, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.6 million) on our common stock, which was paid on March 31, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 14, 2014. The amount of future 31 dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors.Cash Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation and gathering commitments. As of March 31, 2014, we do not have any capital leases. As of March 31, 2014, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of March 31, 2014, we had a total of $127.4 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility. Since December 31, 2013, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $94.0 million increase in our outstanding bank credit facility balance and new transportation contracts which increased these commitments by approximately $628.4 million over the next 25 years. Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives, as we typically utilize commodity swap and collar contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our on-going development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax loss of $53.4 million at March 31, 2014. The contracts expire monthly through December 2016. At March 31, 2014, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:    Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   WeightedAverage Hedge Price   Natural Gas               2014   Collars   447,500 Mmbtu/day   $3.84–$ 4.48   2015   Collars   145,000 Mmbtu/day   $4.07–$ 4.56   2014   Swaps   240,145 Mmbtu/day   $4.18   2015   Swaps   234,966 Mmbtu/day   $4.19   2016   Swaps   60,000 Mmbtu/day   $4.18   Crude Oil               2014   Collars   2,000 bbls/day   $85.55–$ 100.00   2014   Swaps   9,169 bbls/day   $94.40   2015   Swaps   6,000 bbls/day   $89.48    NGLs (C3-Propane)               2014   Swaps   12,000 bbls/day   $ 1.02/gallon    NGLs (NC4-Normal butane)               2014   Swaps   4,000 bbls/day   $ 1.34/gallon    NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)               2014   Swaps   1,000 bbls/day   $ 2.11/gallon  Interest Rates At March 31, 2014, we had approximately $3.2 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.7 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.8%. Bank debt totaling $594.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 1.9% at March 31, 2014. The 30-day LIBOR rate on March 31, 2014 was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on March 31, 2014 would cost us approximately $5.9 million in additional annual interest expense. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations. 32 Inflation and Changes in Prices Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2014 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.  ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated. Market Risk We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivatives instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Natural gas prices affect us more than oil prices because approximately 69% of our December 31, 2013 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2013 to March 31, 2014. Commodity Price Risk We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. At March 31, 2014, our derivatives program includes swaps and collars. These contracts expire monthly through December 2016. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of March 31, 2014, approximated a net unrealized pretax loss of $53.4 million. At March 31, 2014, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:    Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   WeightedAverage Hedge Price   FairMarketValue                   (in thousands)   Natural Gas                   2014   Collars   447,500 Mmbtu/day   $ 3.84–$ 4.48   $ (22,369)   2015   Collars   145,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.07–$ 4.56   $ 2,959   2014   Swaps   240,145 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.18   $ (18,737)   2015   Swaps   234,966 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.19   $ (1,249)   2016   Swaps   60,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.18   $ 613                       Crude Oil                   2014   Collars   2,000 bbls/day   $ 85.55–$ 100.00   $ (972)   2014   Swaps   9,169 bbls/day   $ 94.40   $ (7,976)   2015   Swaps   6,000 bbls/day   $ 89.48   $ (871)                       NGLs (C3-Propane)                   2014   Swaps   12,000 bbls/day   $ 1.02/gallon   $ (7,816)                       NGLs (NC4-Normal butane)                   2014   Swaps   4,000 bbls/day   $ 1.34/gallon   $ 3,159  33   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   WeightedAverage Hedge Price   FairMarketValue                   (in thousands)                      NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                   2014   Swaps   1,000 bbls/day   $ 2.11/gallon   $ (101)  We expect our NGLs production to continue to increase. In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGLs production and we believe NGL prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional markets. Currently, there is little demand, or facilities to supply the existing demand, for ethane in the Appalachian region. We have previously announced three ethane agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. The remaining facility is expected to begin operations in mid-2015. We cannot assure you that this last facility will become available. If we are not able to sell ethane, we may be required to curtail production or purchase natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas, which will adversely affect our revenues.Other Commodity Risk We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. In addition to the collars and swaps discussed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a loss of $3.6 million at March 31, 2014, the volumes are for 254,164 Mmbtu/day and they expire monthly through March 2015.The following table shows the fair value of our collars, swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at March 31, 2014. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                Hypothetical Changein Fair Value     Hypothetical Changein Fair Value                 Increase of     Decrease of           Fair Value     10%     25%     10%     25%     Collars   $ (20,381 )   $ (61,374 )    $ (168,347 )     $  53,858  $     147,812     Swaps     (32,979 )      (137,656 )       (344,130 )       139,462        349,499     Basis swaps      (3,639 )      1,254        3,134        (1,340 )       (3,254 )  Our commodity-based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with the majority of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At March 31, 2014, our derivative counterparties include fourteen financial institutions, of which all but two are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts have been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At March 31, 2014, we had $3.2 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.7 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.8%. Bank debt totaling $594.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 1.9% on March 31, 2014. On March 31, 2014, the 30-day LIBOR rate was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates 34 on the floating-rate debt outstanding on March 31, 2014, would cost us approximately $5.9 million in additional annual interest expense.  ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2014 at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    35 PART II – OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS See Note 15 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part I Item 1 above for a summary of our legal proceedings, such information being incorporated herein by reference.  ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.  ITEM 6.EXHIBITS
