Item 1A. Risk Factors as filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 as filed with the SEC on February 22, 2012.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company primarily engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian and Southwestern regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. Unless otherwise indicated, the information included herein relates to our continuing operations.  Our objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Our corporate headquarters is located at 100 Throckmorton Street, Fort Worth, Texas.  Recent Developments  On October 9, 2012, we signed a definitive agreement to sell certain of our oil and gas properties in southern Oklahoma which includes approximately 45 producing wells for a purchase price of $135.0 million, subject to normal post-closing adjustments. The completion of the sale is dependent on prospective buyer due diligence procedures and there can be no assurance the sale will be completed or that there will not be changes to the sales price. The closing date is currently expected to be November 19, 2012.  Market Conditions  Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for commodities are inherently volatile. The following table lists average NYMEX prices for natural gas and oil for three months and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011.

Total revenues decreased $75.7 million or 20% in third quarter 2012 over the same period of 2011. This decrease was due to a decrease in mark-to-market gain from derivatives and lower realized prices partially offset by higher production. Our third quarter 2012 production growth was due to the continued success of our drilling program, particularly in the Marcellus Shale. Third quarter 2012 natural gas production increased over 50% and, as we continue to focus our efforts on growth of our liquids production, third quarter production for oil and NGLs increased over 30%.  During the first nine months 2012, we achieved the following financial and operating results:        •    increased revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGL and oil by 13% from the same period of 2011;        •    achieved 50% production growth (excluding our Barnett Shale properties which were sold in April 2011);        •    reduced direct operating expenses per mcfe 35%;        •    reduced our DD&A rate 9%;        •    maintained a strong balance sheet by issuing $600.0 million of new 5.00% 10-year senior subordinated notes;        •    entered into additional derivative contracts for 2012, 2013 and 2014; and        •    realized $461.1 million of cash flow from operating activities.  Total revenues increased $65.6 million or 7% in the first nine months 2012 over the same period of 2011. This increase was due to higher production partially offset by lower realized prices and a decrease in the mark-to-market gain from derivatives. Our first nine months 2012 production growth is due to our continued successful drilling program, particularly in the Marcellus Shale.  We believe natural gas, NGLs and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new technology and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for the remainder of 2012, 2013 and 2014, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices that we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future. As a result of the decline in natural gas prices, we continue to focus our capital budget expenditures on oil and liquids-rich-gas drilling activities.  Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices, production volumes and the value of certain of our derivative contracts. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales include netback arrangements where we sell natural gas and oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. In this instance, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. Revenues are also realized from sales arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at a specific delivery point and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation deduction. Third party transportation costs we incur to get our commodity to the delivery point are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense. Hedges included in natural gas, NGLs and oil sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Cash settlements and changes in the market value of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in derivative fair value income or loss in the statement of operations. For more information on revenues from derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges, see Derivative fair value (loss) income discussion below.    24    Table of Contents In third quarter 2012, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 11% from the same period of 2011 with a 48% increase in production partially offset by a 25% decrease in realized prices. In the first nine months 2012, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 13% from the same period of 2011 with a 50% increase in production partially offset by a 25% decrease in realized prices. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):                                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2012     2011     Change     %     2012     2011     Change     %               Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                                     Gas wellhead   $ 159,525     $ 165,581     $ (6,056 )      (4 %)    $ 399,006     $ 446,564     $ (47,558 )      (11 %)    Gas hedges realized (a)     62,150       26,758       35,392       132 %      198,675       80,659       118,016       146 %                                                                            Total gas revenue   $ 221,675     $ 192,339     $ 29,336       15 %    $ 597,681     $ 527,223     $ 70,458       13 %                                                                                      Total NGLs revenue   $ 56,826     $ 69,430     $ (12,604 )      (18 %)    $ 189,604     $ 188,851     $ 753       —  %                                                                                      Oil wellhead   $ 59,221     $ 42,461     $ 16,760       39 %    $ 166,718     $ 125,472     $ 41,246       33 %    Oil hedges realized (a)     (682 )      —        (682 )      —  %      (997 )      —        (997 )      —  %                                                                            Total oil revenue   $ 58,539     $ 42,461     $ 16,078       38 %    $ 165,721     $ 125,472     $ 40,249       32 %                                                                                      Combined wellhead   $ 275,572     $ 277,472     $ (1,900 )      (1 %)    $ 755,328     $ 760,887     $ (5,559 )      (1 %)    Combined hedges (a)     61,468       26,758       34,710       130 %      197,678       80,659       117,019       145 %                                                                            Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales   $ 337,040     $ 304,230     $ 32,810       11 %    $ 953,006     $ 841,546     $ 111,460       13 %                                                                               (a)   Cash settlements related to derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting.  Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production offset by the natural decline of our natural gas and oil wells and asset sales. For third quarter 2012, our production volumes increased 62% in our Appalachian region and increased 1% in our Southwestern region when compared to the same period of 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, our production volumes increased 66% in our Appalachian region and increased 6% in our Southwestern region when compared to the same period of 2011. Our production for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 is set forth in the following table:                                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2012     2011     Change     %     2012     2011     Change     %               Production (a)                                           Natural gas (mcf)     57,347,638       37,441,857       19,905,781       53 %      156,274,072       100,058,851       56,215,221       56 %    NGLs (bbls)     1,843,667       1,430,568       413,099       29 %      4,975,086       3,798,635       1,176,451       31 %    Crude oil (bbls)     712,858       523,074       189,784       36 %      1,943,961       1,462,168       481,793       33 %    Total (mcfe) (b)     72,686,788       49,163,709       23,523,079       48 %      197,788,354       131,623,669       66,164,685       50 %              Average daily production (a)                                           Natural gas (mcf)     623,344       406,977       216,367       53 %      570,343       366,516       203,827       56 %    NGLs (bbls)     20,040       15,550       4,490       29 %      18,157       13,914       4,243       30 %    Crude oil (bbls)     7,748       5,686       2,062       36 %      7,095       5,356       1,739       32 %    Total (mcfe) (b)     790,074       534,388       255,686       48 %      721,855       482,138       239,717       50 %       (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.    (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.  Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received during third quarter 2012 was $4.17 per mcfe compared to $5.75 per mcfe in the same period of 2011. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received was $4.24 per mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to $5.80 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualify for hedge accounting. Average sales prices (wellhead) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are    25    Table of Contents  reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying statements of operations. Average sales prices (wellhead) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds.

Derivative fair value (loss) income was a loss of $40.7 million in third quarter 2012 compared to income of $65.8 million in the same period of 2011. Derivative fair value (loss) income was income of $47.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to income of $78.0 million in the same period of 2011. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Mark-to-market accounting treatment results in volatility of our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. The decrease in the mark-to-market gain or loss in the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 is primarily due to the change in the fair value of our oil and NGL derivatives. Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in derivative fair value (loss) income, is associated with contracts that qualify for hedge accounting. The ineffective portion is calculated as the difference between the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the estimated change in future cash flows from the item being hedged.    26    Table of Contents The following table presents information about the components of derivative fair value (loss) income for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2012     2011     2012     2011           Change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting (a)   $ (53,646 )    $ 58,990     $ 30,075     $ 67,093     Realized gain (loss) on settlements – natural gas (b) (c)     —        5,334       —        8,424     Realized gain (loss) on settlements – oil (b) (c)     1,955       285       (1,899 )      (7,727 )    Realized gain (loss) on settlements – NGLs (b) (c)     14,682       3,087       20,442       3,087     Hedge ineffectiveness – realized (c)     988       2,036       3,451       4,558      – unrealized (a)     (4,707 )      (3,971 )      (5,061 )      2,531                                               Derivative fair value (loss) income   $ (40,728 )    $ 65,761     $ 47,008     $ 77,966                                                  (a)   These amounts are unrealized and are not included in average realized price calculations.    (b)   These amounts represent realized gains and losses on settled derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.    (c)  These settlements are included in average realized price calculations (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range).  Gain (loss) on the sale of assets was a gain of $949,000 in third quarter 2012 compared to a gain of $203,000 in the same period of 2011. In third quarter 2012, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $746,000 on the sale of unproved property in Pennsylvania where we received proceeds of $13.9 million. Gain (loss) on the sale of assets was a loss of $12.7 million in the first nine months 2012 compared to a loss of $1.3 million in the same period of 2011. In the first nine months 2012, we also sold a seventy-five percent interest in an East Texas prospect which included a suspended exploratory well and unproved properties for proceeds of $8.6 million resulting in a pre-tax loss of $10.9 million and recorded a $2.5 million pre-tax loss on the sale of a Marcellus exploratory well where we received proceeds of $2.5 million. In the first nine months 2011, we recorded a loss of $1.7 million related to the sale of certain derivatives included with the sale of our Barnett Shale properties.  Other revenue in third quarter 2012 was a loss of $2.4 million compared to a gain of $442,000 in the same period of 2011. The third quarter 2012 includes loss from equity method investments of $1.0 million and a transportation and gathering loss of $1.4 million. The third quarter 2011 includes loss from equity method investments of $641,000 offset by transportation and gathering revenue of $817,000. Other revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was a loss of $3.1 million compared to a gain of $357,000 in the same period of 2011. The nine months ended September 30, 2012 includes loss from equity method investments of $195,000 and a transportation and gathering loss of $3.3 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2011 includes various lawsuit proceeds and refunds partially offset by a loss from equity method investments of $1.4 million.  We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, production and ad valorem tax expense includes a Pennsylvania impact fee of $0.21 per mcfe of which $0.12 per mcfe is a retroactive adjustment for wells drilled prior to 2012.

We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and manage existing properties. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Even though our production volumes increased 48%, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for third quarter 2012 decreased 1% with an increase in the number of producing wells more than offset by lower water hauling and disposal costs, equipment rental and well services. We incurred $1.4 million of workover costs in third quarter 2012 compared to $1.2 million of workover costs in the same period of 2011.    27    Table of Contents On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in third quarter 2012 declined 33% to $0.41 from the same period of 2011, with the decrease consisting of lower water hauling and disposal costs, workover costs, equipment rental and well services. We expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our dry gas Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas somewhat offset by higher operating costs on our liquids-rich wells. However, operating costs in the Mississippian play are higher on a per mcfe basis than the Marcellus Shale play. As production increases from the Mississippian play, our direct operating expense per mcfe will begin to increase.  Direct operating expense was $85.7 million in the first nine months 2012 compared to $87.1 million in the same period of 2011. Even though our production volumes increased 50%, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses decreased 2% with an increase in the number of producing wells and higher workover costs offset by lower water hauling and disposal costs, equipment rental and well service costs. We incurred $3.5 million of workover costs in the first nine months 2012 compared to $2.2 million in the same period of 2011.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in the first nine months 2012 decreased 35% to $0.43 from the same period of 2011, with the decrease consisting of lower water hauling and disposal costs, lower equipment rental and well services. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and SARs as part of the compensation of field employees. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011:                                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2012     2011     Change     %Change     2012     2011     Change     %Change               Lease operating expense   $ 0.38     $ 0.57     $ (0.19 )      (33 %)    $ 0.40     $ 0.63     $ (0.23 )      (37 %)    Workovers     0.02       0.03       (0.01 )      (33 %)      0.02       0.02       —        —  %    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.01       0.01       —        —  %      0.01       0.01       —        —  %                                                                            Total direct operating expense   $ 0.41     $ 0.61     $ (0.20 )      (33 %)    $ 0.43     $ 0.66     $ (0.23 )      (35 %)                                                                           Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the new Pennsylvania impact fee. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $3.4 million in third quarter 2012 compared to $7.3 million in the same period of 2011. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) decreased to $0.05 in third quarter 2012 compared to $0.15 in the same period of 2011 due to lower natural gas and oil prices and an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” on unconventional natural gas and oil production which includes the Marcellus Shale. Included in third quarter 2012 is a $5.4 million impact fee ($0.07 per mcfe) accrual.  Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $14.5 million ($0.07 per mcfe) in the first nine months 2012 compared to $21.7 million ($0.17 per mcfe) in the same period of 2011 due to lower natural gas and oil prices and an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes. The nine months ended September 30, 2012 also includes a $24.7 million ($0.12 per mcfe) retroactive impact fee which covers all wells drilled prior to 2012 which was paid in September 2012. Also included in first nine months 2012 is a $18.0 million impact fee ($0.09 per mcfe) for wells drilled prior to 2012 and wells drilled in the first nine months 2012 to be paid April 2013.  General and administrative expense was $44.5 million in third quarter 2012 compared to $35.9 million for the same period of 2011. The 2012 increase of $8.6 million when compared to 2011 is due to higher salaries and benefits ($2.4 million), an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.6 million and higher legal and office expenses, including information technology. We continue to incur higher wages which we consider necessary to remain competitive in the industry. Our number of general and administrative (“G&A”) employees increased 12% at September 30, 2012 when compared to September 30, 2011. General and administrative expense for the first nine months 2012 increased $18.2 million or 17% from the same period of the prior year primarily due to higher salaries and benefits ($10.0 million), an increase in stock-based compensation of $3.3 million, higher advertising costs ($1.5 million) and higher office expenses, including information technology, partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses which also includes an insurance recovery. Our personnel costs continue to increase as we invest in our technical teams and other staffing to support our expansion into our various shale plays. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights granted to our G&A employees and directors as part of compensation. On a per mcfe basis, G&A expense decreased 16% from the third quarter 2011 and 23% from the nine months 2011 with an increase in spending more than offset by higher production volumes.

The following table presents information about interest expense for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2012     2011     2012     2011           Bank credit facility   $ 3,224     $ 1,443     $ 7,884     $ 6,854     Subordinated notes     38,344       30,843       109,365       92,877     Amortization of deferred financing costs and other     2,429       1,895       6,841       5,403     Allocated to discontinued operations     —        —        —        (14,791 )                                              Total interest expense   $ 43,997     $ 34,181     $ 124,090     $ 90,343                                              The increase in interest expense for third quarter 2012 from the same period of 2011 was primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt balances. In March 2012, we issued $600.0 million of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay $350.0 million of our outstanding credit facility balance and for general corporate purposes. In May 2011, we issued $500.0 million of 5.75% senior subordinated notes due 2021. We used the proceeds for general corporate purposes and to purchase or redeem $150.0 million of our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 and $250.0 million of our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016. The 2012 and 2011 note issuances were undertaken to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for third quarter 2012 was $375.2 million compared to no outstanding bank debt for the same period of 2011 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.1% in 2012.  The increase in interest expense for the first nine months 2012 from the same period of 2011 was due to an increase in outstanding debt balances and higher interest rates. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $239.9 million compared to $197.5 million for 2011 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.2% in the first nine months 2012 compared to 2.2% in the same period of 2011.  Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) was $123.1 million in third quarter 2012 compared to $93.6 million in the same period of 2011. The increase in third quarter 2012 when compared to the same period of 2011 is due to a 9% decrease in depletion rates more than offset by a 48% increase in production. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $1.61 per mcfe in third quarter 2012 compared to $1.77 per mcfe in the same period of 2011. Depletion expense in the three months ended 2011 includes an adjustment of $4.2 million to record prior years depletion related to our Oklahoma properties.  DD&A was $332.0 million in the first nine months 2012 compared to $244.1 million in the same period of 2011. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011 is due to an 8% decrease in depletion rates more than offset by a 50% increase in production. Depletion expense was $1.60 per mcfe in the first nine months 2012 compared to $1.73 per mcfe in the same period of 2011. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011:    29    Table of Contents                                         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2012     2011     Change     %Change     2012     2011     Change     %Change               Depletion and amortization   $ 1.61     $ 1.77     $ (0.16 )      (9 %)    $ 1.60     $ 1.73     $ (0.13 )      (8 %)    Depreciation     0.04       0.10       (0.06 )      (60 %)      0.05       0.09       (0.04 )      (44 %)    Accretion and other     0.04       0.03       0.01       33 %      0.03       0.03       —        —  %                                                                            Total DD&A expense   $ 1.69     $ 1.90     $ (0.21 )      (11 %)    $ 1.68     $ 1.85     $ (0.17 )      (9 %)                                                                           Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, transportation, gathering and compression, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties and deferred compensation plan expenses. In third quarter 2012, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($598,000), exploration expense ($1.1 million) and general and administrative expense ($10.1 million) for a total of $12.2 million. In third quarter 2011, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($463,000), exploration expense ($902,000) and general and administrative expense ($8.5 million) for a total of $10.2 million. In the first nine months 2012, stock-based compensation was allocated to direct operating expense ($1.6 million), exploration expense ($3.0 million) and general and administrative expense ($30.8 million) for a total of $36.8 million. In the first nine months 2011, stock-based compensation was allocated to direct operating expense ($1.4 million), exploration expense ($3.2 million) and general and administrative expense ($27.5 million) for a total of $33.2 million. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants and SARs grants.  Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $51.6 million in third quarter 2012 compared to $32.4 million in the same period of 2011. Transportation, gathering and compression expenses was $137.2 million in the first nine months 2012 compared to $86.2 million in the same period of 2011. These third party costs are higher than 2011 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering and compression agreements. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range).  Exploration expense was $14.8 million in third quarter 2012 compared to $17.6 million in the same period of 2011. Exploration expense was lower in third quarter 2012 when compared to 2011 due to lower seismic costs and lower dry hole costs. The nine months ended September 30, 2012 also includes lower dry hole costs compared to the same period of 2011, and lower delay rentals. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 (in thousands):                                            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,        2012     2011     Change     %Change     2012     2011     Change     %Change               Seismic   $ 6,995     $ 8,619     $ (1,624 )      (19 %)    $ 26,763     $ 26,156     $ 607       2 %    Delay rentals and other     3,495       2,572       923       36 %      11,084       14,365       (3,281 )      (23 %)    Personnel expense     3,121       3,058       63       2 %      10,059       10,234       (175 )      (2 %)    Stock-based compensation expense     1,126       849       277       33 %      3,047       3,115       (68 )      (2 %)    Dry hole expense     15       2,508       (2,493 )      (99 %)      832       2,515       (1,683 )      (67 %)                                                                            Total exploration expense   $ 14,752     $ 17,606     $ (2,854 )      (16 %)    $ 51,785     $ 56,385     $ (4,600 )      (8 %)                                                                           Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $40.1 million in third quarter 2012 compared to $16.6 million in the same period of 2011. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $104.0 million in the first nine months 2012 compared to $52.1 million in the same period of 2011. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments will likely be recorded. The increase from 2011 to 2012 is primarily related to our Marcellus Shale operations and is due, in part, to lower    30    Table of Contents  natural gas prices and plans to move towards areas with higher expectation of wet gas. In third quarter 2012, we impaired individually significant unproved properties in the Barnett shale of North Texas (the last of our unproved properties in the area) for $19.6 million because we have determined we will not drill and will allow the leases to expire. Also, due to a transaction in second quarter 2012, we impaired individually significant unproved properties in Pennsylvania for $23.1 million because we will not drill in these areas.  Deferred compensation plan expense was $20.1 million in third quarter 2012 compared to $8.7 million in the same period of 2011. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price increased from $61.87 at June 30, 2012 to $69.87 at September 30, 2012. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price increased from $55.50 at June 30, 2011 to $58.46 at September 30, 2011. Deferred compensation plan expense was $21.6 million for the nine months ended 2012 compared to $33.6 million in the same period of 2011. During the first nine months 2012, our stock price increased from $61.94 at December 31, 2011 to $69.87 at September 30, 2012. In the first nine months 2011, our stock price increased from $44.98 at December 31, 2010 to $58.46 at September 30, 2011.  Loss on extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 was $18.6 million. In May and June 2011, we purchased or redeemed our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 at a price equal to 102.31% and we purchased or redeemed our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016 at a price equal to 103.95%. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $18.6 million which includes a call premium and other consideration of $13.3 million and expensing of related deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt. The purchase and redemption of our 6.375% senior subordinated notes and our 7.5% senior subordinated notes was funded by the proceeds received from the issuance, in May 2011, of our $500.0 million 5.75% senior subordinated notes due in 2021.  Impairment of proved properties and other assets was $1.3 million in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2012. The third quarter 2012 includes $1.3 million impairment on surface acreage in Texas. Impairment expense in the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2011 includes $31.2 million related to our East Texas proved oil and gas properties and $7.5 million related to our Gulf Coast onshore proved properties.  Income tax (benefit) expense was a benefit of $29.1 million in third quarter 2012 compared to income tax expense of $22.5 million in third quarter 2011. The decrease in income taxes in third quarter 2012 reflects a 249% decrease in income from continuing operations when compared to the same period of 2011. For the third quarter, the effective tax rate was 35.1% in 2012 compared to 40.4% in 2011. Income tax benefit was $17.9 million in the first nine months 2012 compared to income tax expense of $35.3 million in the same period of 2011. The decrease in income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 reflects a 172% decrease in income from continuing operations when compared to the same period of 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the effective tax rate was 30.9% compared to 43.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The 2012 and 2011 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, permanent differences and changes in our valuation allowances related to our deferred tax asset for future deferred compensation plan distributions to senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation (including these distributions) would exceed the $1.0 million deductible limit provided under section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40% for the remainder of 2012.  Discontinued operations include the operating results and impairment losses related to our Barnett Shale properties. Substantially all of these properties were sold in April 2011 for proceeds of $889.3 million including certain derivatives assumed by the buyer and we recorded a gain of $4.9 million on the sale. See also Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements. Interest expense is allocated to discontinued operations based on the ratio of net assets of discontinued operations to our consolidated net assets plus long-term debt.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In the first nine months 2012, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2012, 2013 and 2014 to protect future cash flows. In March 2012, we issued $600.0 million of new 5.00% ten-year senior subordinated notes. On April 9, 2012, we increased our committed facility amount under our bank credit facility from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion and on October 4, 2012, our borrowing base and facility amount were reaffirmed.  During first nine months 2012, our net cash provided from continuing operations of $461.1 million, proceeds from the sale of assets of $32.1 million, proceeds from the issuance of our 5.00% senior subordinated notes and borrowings under our bank credit facility were used to fund $1.3 billion of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At September 30, 2012, we had $151,000 in cash and total assets of $6.7 billion.  Long-term debt at September 30, 2012 totaled $2.8 billion, including $461.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility and $2.4 billion of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at September 30, 2012 was $1.2 billion. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term    31    Table of Contents  financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A material drop in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Credit Arrangements  As of September 30, 2012, we maintained a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of February 18, 2016. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders semi-annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors but primarily on the lenders’ assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of two thirds of the lenders; increases to the borrowing base require 97% lender approval. On April 9, 2012, the facility amount on our bank credit facility was increased from $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion and we added three additional banks and, on October 4, 2012, our borrowing base was reaffirmed at $2.0 billion and our facility amount was also reaffirmed at $1.75 billion. Our current bank group is currently comprised of twenty-eight financial institutions.  Our bank debt and our subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt and our subordinated notes). The debt agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2012.  Capital Requirements  Our primary capital requirements are for exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. During the first nine months 2012, $1.2 billion of capital was expended on drilling projects. Also in the first nine months 2012, $173.7 million was expended on acquisitions of unproved acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale and in the horizontal Mississippian oil play. Our 2012 capital program, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be funded by net cash flow from operations, a debt offering, proceeds from asset sales and borrowings under our credit facility. Our capital expenditure budget for 2012 is currently set at $1.6 billion, excluding proved property acquisitions. To the extent capital requirements exceed internally generated cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and our committed capacity under our bank credit facility, then debt or equity may be issued in capital market transactions to fund these requirements. On October 9, 2012, we signed a definitive agreement to sell certain of our oil and gas properties in southern Oklahoma for a purchase price of $135.0 million. We monitor our capital expenditures on an ongoing basis, adjusting the amount up or down and also between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt.  The forward-looking statements about our capital budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for natural gas and oil, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorists acts and the government or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.    32    Table of Contents Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and since our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of September 30, 2012, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 62.5 Bcfe for 2012, 195.3 Bcfe for 2013 and 131.8 Bcfe for 2014.  Net cash provided from continuing operations in first nine months 2012 was $461.1 million compared to $428.9 million in the same period of 2011. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2011 to 2012 reflects a 50% increase in production partially offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 27%) and higher operating costs. As of September 30, 2012, we have hedged approximately 81% of our projected production for the remainder of 2012, with approximately 84% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first nine months 2012 was a positive $26.3 million compared to negative $30.8 million for the same period of 2011.  Net cash provided from discontinued operations for the first nine months 2011 was $19.5 million. Substantially all of our Barnett Shale properties were sold in April 2011 with a February 1, 2011 effective date.  Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations in first nine months 2012 was $1.3 billion compared to $983.7 million in the same period of 2011.  During the first nine months 2012, we:        •    spent $1.2 billion on natural gas and oil property additions;        •    spent $175.0 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and        •    received proceeds from asset sales of $32.1 million.  During the first nine months 2011, we:        •    spent $859.8 million on natural gas and oil property additions;        •    spent $151.1 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and        •    received proceeds from asset sales of $40.3 million.  Net cash provided from financing activities in the first nine months ended 2012 was an increase of $848.6 million compared to a decrease of $256.3 million in the same period of 2011. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings.  During the first nine months 2012, we:        •    borrowed $1.1 billion and repaid $865.0 million under our bank credit facility; ending the quarter with a $461.0 million outstanding balance on our bank debt;        •    issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amounts of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2022 with net proceeds of approximately $589.5 million; and        •    spent $12.6 million related to debt issuance costs.    33    Table of Contents During the first nine months 2011, we:        •    borrowed $490.8 million and repaid $764.8 million under our bank credit facility, ending the period with no outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility;        •    issued $500.0 million principal amount of 5.75% senior subordinated notes due 2021, at par;        •    purchased or redeemed $150.0 million principal amount of our 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 at a redemption price of 102.31% and purchased or redeemed $250.0 million principal amount of our 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016 at a redemption price of 103.9%;        •    spent $22.0 million related to debt issuance costs; and        •    recorded a decrease of $39.8 million in cash overdrafts.  Cash Dividend Payments  The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures and various other factors. On September 4, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.5 million) on our common stock, which was paid on September 28, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 17, 2012.  Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation commitments. As of September 30, 2012, we do not have any capital leases. As of September 30, 2012, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of September 30, 2012, we had a total of $62.1 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility supporting obligations in the table below.  The following table summarizes our contractual financial obligations at September 30, 2012 and their future maturities. In addition to the table below, we have contracted with several pipeline companies through 2029 to deliver natural gas and NGL production volumes from Marcellus Shale wells, which is contingent on physical pipeline construction and modifications and therefore, is not included below. We expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facility, additional debt issuances and proceeds from asset sales (in thousands).

Interest paid on our bank credit facility would be approximately $8.2 million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance.    (b)   Derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of September 30, 2012. While such payments will be funded by proceeds received from the sale of our production, production receipts may be received after our payments to counterparties, which can result in borrowings under our bank credit facility.    (c)   The ultimate settlement amount and timing cannot be precisely determined in advance. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.    (d)   This table excludes the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets.    34    Table of Contents Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives, as we typically utilize commodity swap, collar and call option contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. In 2011, we also entered into “sold” NGL derivative swap contracts for the natural gasoline component of natural gas liquids and in 2012 we entered into “purchased” derivative swaps for natural gasoline. In addition, in second quarter 2012, we entered into NGL derivative swap contracts for propane. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets.  At September 30, 2012, we had open swap contracts covering 89.6 Bcf of natural gas at prices averaging $3.62 per mcf, 3.3 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $95.70 per barrel, 3.0 million net barrels of NGLs (the C5 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $95.80 per barrel and 2.4 million barrels of NGLs (the C3 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $36.27 per barrel. We had collars covering 232.0 Bcf of natural gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $4.23 to $4.83 per mcf and 2.0 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $86.88 to $98.17 per barrel. We also have sold call options covering 0.4 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $85.00 per barrel and purchased put options for 0.2 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $80.00 per barrel. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax gain of $139.3 million at September 30, 2012. The contracts expire monthly through December 2014.  At September 30, 2012, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                 Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   WeightedAverage Hedge Price          Natural Gas              2012   Collars   279,641 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.76–$ 5.22     2013   Collars   240,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.73–$ 5.20     2014   Collars   325,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.75–$ 4.47     2012   Swaps   270,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.77     2013   Swaps   177,521 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.57          Crude Oil              2012   Collars   2,000 bbls/day   $  70.00–$ 80.00     2013   Collars   3,000 bbls/day   $  90.60–$ 100.00     2014   Collars   2,000 bbls/day   $  85.55–$ 100.00     2012   Call Options   4,700 bbls/day     $ 85.00     2012   Put Options   2,500 bbls/day     $ 80.00     2013   Swaps   5,081 bbls/day     $ 96.59     2014   Swaps   4,000 bbls/day     $ 94.56          NGLs (Natural Gasoline)              2012   Sold Swaps   12,000 bbls/day     $ 96.28     2013   Sold Swaps   8,000 bbls/day     $ 89.64     2012   Purchased Swaps   5,500 bbls/day     $ 82.37     2013   Purchased Swaps   1,500 bbls/day     $ 76.30          NGLs (Propane)              2012   Swaps   6,000 bbls/day     $ 38.67     2013   Swaps   5,000 bbls/day     $ 35.55    The United States Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as Range, that participate in that market. The new regulation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act required the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. In July 2012 certain definitions were adopted by the SEC and the CFTC and based on those definitions, we believe we will qualify for the end-user exception related to the clearing requirement for swaps but we will be required to adhere to new reporting requirements.    35    Table of Contents Interest Rates  At September 30, 2012, we had $2.8 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.4 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 6.4%. Bank debt totaling $461.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 1.8% at September 30, 2012. The 30-day LIBOR rate on September 30, 2012 was 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2012 would cost us approximately $4.6 million in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2012 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.    36    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are US dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivatives instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Natural gas prices affect us more than oil prices because approximately 79% of our December 31, 2011 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2011 to September 30, 2012.  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. We have also entered into call option derivative contracts under which we sold call options in exchange for a premium from the counterparty. At the time of settlement of these monthly call options, if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option, we will pay the counterparty such excess and if the market settles below the fixed price of the call option, no payment is due from either party. At September 30, 2012, our derivatives program includes swaps (both purchased and sold NGL swaps), collars, call and put options. As of September 30, 2012, we had open swap contracts covering 89.6 Bcf of natural gas at prices averaging $3.62 per mcf, 3.3 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $95.70 per barrel, 3.0 million net barrels of NGLs (the C5 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $95.80 per barrel and 2.4 million barrels of NGLs (the C3 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $36.27 per barrel. We had collars covering 232.0 Bcf of natural gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $4.23 to $4.83 per mcf and 2.0 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $86.88 to $98.17 per barrel. We also have sold call options covering 0.4 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $85.00 per barrel and purchased put options for 0.2 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $80.00 per barrel. These contracts expire monthly through December 2014. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of September 30, 2012, approximated a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $139.3 million.    37    Table of Contents At September 30, 2012, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   WeightedAverageHedge Price   FairMarketValue                    (in thousands)     Natural Gas                 2012   Collars   279,641 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.76–$ 5.22   $ 38,267     2013   Collars   240,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.73–$ 5.20   $ 82,549     2014   Collars   325,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 3.75–$ 4.47   $ (9,887 )    2012   Swaps   270,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 3.77   $ 11,975     2013   Swaps   177,521 Mmbtu/day   $ 3.57   $ (17,662 )          Crude Oil                 2012   Collars   2,000 bbls/day   $ 70.00–$ 80.00   $ (2,396 )    2013   Collars   3,000 bbls/day   $ 90.60–$ 100.00   $ 975     2014   Collars   2,000 bbls/day   $ 85.55–$ 100.00   $ 121     2012   Call options   4,700 bbls/day   $ 85.00   $ (3,733 )    2012   Put options   2,500 bbls/day   $ 80.00   $ 77     2013   Swaps   5,081 bbls/day   $ 96.59   $ 5,401     2014   Swaps   4,000 bbls/day   $ 94.56   $ 4,447           NGLs (Natural Gasoline)                 2012   Sold Swaps   12,000 bbls/day   $ 96.28   $ 13,264     2013   Sold Swaps   8,000 bbls/day   $ 89.64   $ 18,195     2012   Purchased Swaps   5,500 bbls/day   $ 82.37   $ 952     2013   Purchased Swaps   1,500 bbls/day   $ 76.30   $ 3,831           NGLs (Propane)                 2012   Swaps   6,000 bbls/day   $ 38.67   $ (87 )    2013   Swaps   5,000 bbls/day   $ 35.55   $ (7,033 )   We expect our NGL production to continue to increase. In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGL production and we also believe NGL prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the percentage of NGL prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional markets.  As of September 30, 2012, the relationship between the price of oil and the price of natural gas is at an unprecedented spread. Normally, natural gas liquids production is a by-product of natural gas production. Due to the current differences in prices, we and other producers may choose to sell natural gas at or below cost or otherwise dispose of natural gas to allow for the sale of only natural gas liquids.  Currently, because there is little demand, or facilities to supply the existing demand, for ethane in the Appalachian region, for our Appalachian production volumes, ethane remains in the natural gas stream. We currently have waivers from two transmission pipelines that allow us to leave ethane in the residue natural gas. We believe the limits are sufficient to cover our production through 2014. We have announced three ethane agreements where we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, which are expected to begin operations in late 2013, early 2014 and early 2015. We cannot assure you that these facilities will become available. If we are not able to sell ethane, we may be required to curtail production which will adversely affect our revenues.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. At times, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements in the past that effectively fix the basis adjustments. We currently have no financial basis swap agreements outstanding.    38    Table of Contents The following table shows the fair value of our collars, swaps, put and call options and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at September 30, 2012. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                                      Hypothetical Changein Fair ValueIncrease of     Hypothetical Changein Fair ValueDecrease of        Fair Value     10%     25%     10%     25%     Collars   $ 109,629     $ (92,408 )    $ (232,482 )    $ 92,916     $ 235,577     Call options     (3,732 )      (3,696 )      (9,622 )      2,677       3,677     Swaps     33,282       (96,597 )      (241,050 )      97,103       243,151     Put options     77       (63 )      (75 )      302       2,409    Our commodity-based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with the majority of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At September 30, 2012, our derivative counterparties include sixteen financial institutions, of which all but two are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts have been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At September 30, 2012, we had $2.8 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.4 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 6.4%. Bank debt totaling $461.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 1.8% on September 30, 2012. On September 30, 2012, the 30-day LIBOR rate was 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2012, would cost us approximately $4.6 million in additional annual interest expense.    39    Table of Contents   ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2012 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2012 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    40    Table of Contents PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  We are the subject of, or party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, we believe that the amount of liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to proceedings or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position as a whole or on our liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operation.      ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.    41    Table of Contents   ITEM 6.  EXHIBITS
