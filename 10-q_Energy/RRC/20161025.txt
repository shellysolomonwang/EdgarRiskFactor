Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on February 25, 2016.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties primarily in the Appalachian and North Louisiana regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area-by-area basis. Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions and divestitures of non-core assets. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices continue to be depressed. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect:        •  revenues, profitability and cash flow;        •  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce;         •  the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures; and        •  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Market Conditions Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for these commodities are inherently volatile. Since year-end 2015, prices have remained under pressure given the current oversupply of such commodities. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGL composite price for the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,           Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2016           2015           2016           2015       Average NYMEX prices (a)                                                 Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.82        $  2.76        $  2.31        $  2.79       Oil (per bbl)     44.96           46.61           41.24           51.18       Mont Belvieu NGLs composite (per gallon) (b)     0.40           0.37           0.38           0.40             (a)  Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.         (b)  Based on our estimated NGLs product component per barrel.  26  Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview of Third Quarter 2016 Results  During third quarter 2016, we achieved the following financial and operating results:         •  completed the Memorial Merger (see “Memorial Merger” below);           •  4% production growth over the same period of 2015;           •  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil increased 21% from the same period of 2015 with a 16% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and an increase in production volumes;           •  revenue realized from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives declined 8% from the same period of 2015;           •  continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania by growing production and proving up and holding acreage;            •  reduced direct operating expenses per mcfe by 38% from the same period of 2015;           •  reduced general and administrative expense per mcfe 14% from the same period of 2015;           •  reduced our depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) rate per mcfe by 18% from the same period of 2015;            •  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2016, 2017 and 2018; and           •  realized $32.4 million of cash flow from operating activities.    Our financial results have been significantly impacted by lower commodity prices. We experienced a decrease in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 28% decrease in realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by us) partially offset by 4% higher production volumes when compared to third quarter 2015. During third quarter 2016, we recognized a net loss of $42.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted common share compared to net loss of $300.9 million, or $1.81 per diluted common share, during third quarter 2015. Overview of the First Nine Months 2016 Results During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we achieved the following financial and operating results:        •  completed the Memorial Merger (see “Memorial Merger” below);           •  4% production growth over the same period of 2015;           •  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil decreased 12% from the same period of 2015 with a 15% decline in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) partially offset by our increase in production volumes;           •  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives declined 16% from the same period of 2015;           •  continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania by growing production, proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage;           •  reduced direct operating expense per mcfe by 39% from the same period of 2015;           •  reduced general and administrative expense per mcfe 20% from the same period of 2015;           •  reduced interest expense per mcfe 6% from the same period of 2015;           •  reduced our DD&A rate by 21% from the same period of 2015;           •  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2016, 2017 and 2018;            •  received proceeds of $111.5 million from the sale of our non-operated interest in certain wells and gathering facilities in Northeast Pennsylvania and $78.6 million of proceeds from the sale of certain properties in Western Oklahoma; and           •  realized $202.0 million of cash flow from operating activities.     27  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized a net loss of $358.6 million, or $2.09 per diluted common share compared to net loss of $391.9 million or $2.36 per diluted common share in the same period of 2015. In first nine months 2016, we experienced a decrease in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 37% decrease in realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by us) partially offset by 4% higher production volumes.  Memorial Merger On September 16, 2016, we completed the Memorial Merger. This merger adds a premier onshore U.S. natural gas resource play to our existing core operating areas. The North Louisiana location provides geographic and marketing diversity to our high quality Appalachia basin assets. We anticipate continuing to improve drilling and well performance in this play by applying best practices from our Marcellus division and capitalizing on synergies. On September 16, 2016, we issued approximately 77.0 million shares of common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Memorial using an exchange ratio of 0.375 of a share of Range common stock for each share of Memorial common stock. The transaction was approved by Range and Memorial stockholders at special meetings held September 15, 2016. See also Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Both types include transportation charges. One type of agreement is a netback agreement, under which we sell natural gas or oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation costs incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. At times, for NGLs, we receive a net price from the purchaser (which is net of processing costs) which is also recorded as revenue at the net price we receive from the purchaser. Under the other type of agreement, we sell natural gas, NGLs or oil at a specific delivery point, pay transportation to a third party and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation cost deduction. In that case, we record transportation costs that we pay to third parties as transportation, gathering and compression expense.  In third quarter 2016, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 21% compared to third quarter 2015 with a 16% increase in average realized prices and a 4% increase in average daily production. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016 natural gas, NGLs and oil sales decreased 12% compared to the same period of 2015 with a 15% decrease in average realized prices partially offset by a 4% increase in average daily production. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, oil and condensate sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,           Nine Months Ended September 30,             2016           2015           Change        %           2016           2015           Change     %       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                                                                        Gas   $  197,476        $  189,113        $  8,363        4  %     $  464,098        $  589,517        $  (125,419  )  (21  %)     NGLs     75,259           31,066           44,193        142  %         198,877           131,822           67,055     51  %     Oil      31,742           31,886           (144  )     ¾  %        75,595           114,262           (38,667  )  (34  %)     Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales  $  304,477        $  252,065        $  52,412        21  %     $  738,570        $  835,601        $  (97,031  )  (12  %)      28  Our production continues to grow through drilling success, additional NGLs extraction and newly acquired production but is partially offset by the natural production decline of our wells and non-core asset sales. When compared to the same period of 2015, our third quarter 2016 production volumes increased 1% in our Appalachian region, despite the sale of our Virginia and West Virginia properties at the end of 2015. Production volumes from the Marcellus Shale in third quarter 2016 were 1.4 Bcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2015, our Marcellus production volumes increased 9% for third quarter 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our production volumes increased 5% in our Appalachian region when compared to the same period of 2015. Production volumes from the Marcellus Shale for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were 1.3 Bcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2015, our Marcellus production volumes increased 14%. Our production for the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is set forth in the following table:         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2016        2015        Change        %        2016     2015     Change     %       Production (a)                                                                                  Natural gas (mcf)     93,466,385           97,273,739           (3,807,354  )     (4  %)         261,331,126        265,511,105        (4,179,979  )  (2  %)    NGLs (bbls)     6,739,161           4,985,092           1,754,069        35  %         19,579,843        15,449,495        4,130,348     27  %    Crude oil (bbls)     810,878           958,628           (147,750  )     (15  %)         2,504,757        3,187,005        (682,248  )  (21  %)    Total (mcfe) (b)     138,766,619           132,936,059           5,830,560        4  %         393,838,726        377,330,105        16,508,621     4  %    Average daily production (a)                                                                                Natural gas (mcf)     1,015,939           1,057,323           (41,384  )     (4  %)         953,763        972,568        (18,805  )  (2  %)    NGLs (bbls)     73,252           54,186           19,066        35  %         71,459        56,592        14,867     26  %    Crude oil (bbls)     8,814           10,420           (1,606  )     (15  %)         9,141        11,674        (2,533  )  (22  %)    Total (mcfe) (b)     1,508,333           1,444,957           63,376        4  %         1,437,368        1,382,162        55,206     4  %       (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.      (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) during third quarter 2016 was $1.58 per mcfe compared to $2.18 per mcfe in third quarter 2015. Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs) was $1.52 per mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.42 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Although we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.   29  Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials. The price we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location, relative quality and other factors. Average natural gas differentials were $0.71 per mcf below NYMEX in third quarter 2016 compared to $0.82 per mcf below NYMEX in third quarter 2015. We also realized gains on our basis hedging in third quarter 2016 of $0.03 per mcf compared to a realized gain of $0.04 per mcf in third quarter 2015. Average natural gas differentials were $0.53 per mcf below NYMEX in first nine months 2016 compared to $0.57 per mcf below NYMEX in first nine months 2015. We also realized gains on basis hedging of $0.04 per mcf in first nine months 2016 compared to a loss of $0.01 per mcf in first nine months 2015. Average realized price calculations for the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are shown below:        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2016        2015        Change        %        2016     2015     Change     %       Average Prices                                                                                  Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements):                                                                                  Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.11        $  1.94        $  0.17        9  %     $  1.78     $  2.22     $  (0.44  )  (20  %)    NGLs (per bbl)     11.17           6.23           4.94        79  %        10.16        8.53        1.63      19  %    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     39.15           33.26           5.89        18  %        30.18        35.85        (5.67  )  (16  %)    Total (per mcfe) (a)     2.19           1.89           0.30        16  %        1.88        2.21        (0.33  )  (15  %)    Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements):                                                                                  Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.50        $  2.77        $  (0.27  )     (10  %)      $  2.56     $  3.06     $  (0.50  )  (16  %)    NGLs (per bbl)     12.43           9.45           2.98        32  %         11.45        10.58        0.87     8  %    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     49.97           76.25           (26.28  )     (34  %)         41.87        68.93        (27.06  )  (39  %)    Total (per mcfe) (a)     2.58           2.93           (0.35  )     (12  %)        2.54        3.17        (0.63  )  (20  %)    Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range):                                                                                  Natural gas (per mcf)  $  1.43        $  1.87        $  (0.44  )     (24  %)     $  1.46     $  2.13     $  (0.67  )  (31  %)    NGLs (per bbl)     6.60           7.09           (0.49  )     (7  %)        5.71        8.21        (2.50  )  (30  %)    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     49.97           76.25           (26.28  )     (34  %)        41.87        68.93        (27.06  )  (39  %)    Total (per mcfe) (a)     1.58           2.18           (0.60  )     (28  %)        1.52        2.42        (0.90  )  (37  %)       (a)  Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  Transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense was $138.8 million in third quarter 2016 compared to $99.6 million in third quarter 2015. Transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense was $400.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $284.3 million in the same period of 2015. These third party costs are higher than 2015 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering, processing, compression and transportation agreements. In addition, first nine months 2016 includes additional expenses related to the commencement of a new NGLs pipeline project where we are able to sell both ethane and propane for export internationally. Also included are additional ethane pipeline capacity charges for ethane transportation to the Gulf Coast. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range).

Derivative fair value income (loss) was a loss of $11.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to an income of $290.1 million in the same period of 2015. All of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment can result in more volatility of our revenues as the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions is included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. The following table summarizes the impact of our commodity derivatives for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):           Three Months Ended September 30,           Nine Months Ended September 30,          2016           2015           2016           2015       Derivative fair value income (loss) per consolidated statements of operations  $  64,556        $  202,004        $  (11,334  )     $  290,052                                                         Non-cash fair value gain (loss): (1)                                                 Natural gas derivatives  $  25,441        $  38,604        $  (195,038  )     $  (26,380  )    Oil derivatives     (5,221  )        5,822           (35,556  )        (60,798  )    NGLs derivatives     (8,656  )        19,649           (41,242  )        16,585       Freight derivatives     (121  )        ¾           (155  )        ¾       Total non-cash fair value gain (loss) (1)  $  11,443        $  64,075        $  (271,991  )     $  (70,593  )                                                      Net cash receipt on derivative settlements:                                                 Natural gas derivatives  $  35,822        $  80,675        $  205,985        $  223,603       Oil derivatives     8,777           41,207           29,277           105,434       NGLs derivatives     8,514           16,047           25,395           31,608       Total net cash receipt (payment)  $  53,113        $  137,929        $  260,657        $  360,645             (1)  Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives only represent the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. We believe that non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to differentiate non-cash fair market value adjustments from settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP, nor should it be considered a substitute for derivative fair value income or loss as reported in our consolidated statements of operations. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in third quarter 2016 was $44.2 million compared to $25.9 million in third quarter 2015 with significantly higher brokered natural gas volumes and higher average sales prices. The third quarter 2015 included $5.4 million of gathering, marketing and broker revenue from our Virginia and West Virginia properties which were sold in fourth quarter 2015. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenues in first nine months 2016 was $119.2 million compared to $61.7 million in the same period of the prior year with significantly higher brokered natural gas volumes offset by slightly lower average sales prices. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we also received $8.9 million from the sale of brokered propane and ethane compared to no revenue from such sales in the same period of 2015. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $9.6 million of gathering, marketing and broker revenue from our Virginia and West Virginia properties which were sold in fourth quarter 2015.  31  Operating Costs Per mcfe We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2016        2015        Change        %        2016     2015     Change     %       Direct operating expense  $  0.16        $  0.26        $  (0.10  )     (38  %)     $  0.17     $  0.28     $  (0.11  )  (39  %)    Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.05           0.06           (0.01  )     (17  %)         0.05        0.07        (0.02  )  (29  %)    General and administrative expense     0.30           0.35           (0.05  )     (14  %)         0.32        0.40        (0.08  )  (20  %)    Interest expense     0.33           0.32           0.01        3  %         0.31        0.33        (0.02  )  (6  %)    Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     0.95           1.16           (0.21  )     (18  %)         0.95        1.20        (0.25  )  (21  %)   Direct operating expense was $22.4 million in third quarter 2016 compared to $35.1 million in third quarter 2015. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Our production volumes increased 4% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for third quarter 2016 declined 36% from the prior year quarter. Our direct operating costs have declined as a result of our cost reduction efforts and the sale of non-core assets. We have experienced cost decreases in most categories of direct operating expenses including lower well service costs, lower personnel expenses, lower water handling and disposal costs, lower workover costs and lower utilities. We incurred $1.6 million of workover costs in third quarter 2016 compared to $2.6 million in third quarter 2015.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in third quarter 2016 decreased 38% from the same period of 2015 with the decrease consisting of lower well service costs, lower water handling and disposal costs and lower personnel costs. We expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost, especially in the dry area of the play, relative to our other operating areas.  Direct operating expense was $67.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $107.0 million in the same period of 2015. Our production volumes increased 4% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses decreased 37% from the same period of the prior year. We have experienced cost decreases in most categories of direct operating expenses due to our cost cutting measures and the sale of certain non-core assets. We incurred $3.0 million of workover costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.1 million in the same period of 2015.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 39% to $0.17 from $0.28 in the same period of 2015, with the decrease consisting of lower well service costs, lower water handling and disposal costs and lower field personnel costs. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of the compensation of field employees. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2016        2015        Change        %        2016     2015     Change     %       Lease operating expense  $  0.15        $  0.24        $  (0.09  )     (38  %)     $  0.16     $  0.26     $  (0.10  )  (38  %)    Workovers     0.01           0.02           (0.01  )     (50  %)         0.01        0.01        ¾     ¾  %    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     ¾           ¾           ¾        ¾  %         ¾        0.01        (0.01  )  (100  %)    Total direct operating expense  $  0.16        $  0.26        $  (0.10  )     (38  %)      $  0.17     $  0.28     $  (0.11  )  (39  %)   Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $946,000 in third quarter 2016 compared to $1.8 million in third quarter 2015. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $0.01 in third quarter 2016 compared to $0.02 in third quarter 2015 due to an increase in volumes not subject to production or ad valorem taxes and lower prices. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” which functions as a tax on unconventional natural gas and oil production from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Included in third quarter 2016 is a $5.8 million impact fee ($0.04 per mcfe) compared to $5.5 million ($0.04 per mcfe) in third quarter 2015.  32  Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $1.9 million ($0.01 per mcfe) in first nine months 2016 compared to $8.4 million ($0.02 per mcfe) in the same period of 2015 due to lower prices and an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes. Included in first nine months 2016 is a $16.8 million ($0.04 per mcfe) impact fee compared to $18.1 million ($0.05 per mcfe) in the same period of 2015. The properties acquired in the Memorial Merger are subject to Louisiana severance tax. General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $41.0 million in third quarter 2016 compared to $46.2 million for third quarter 2015. The third quarter 2016 decrease of $5.2 million when compared to the same period of 2015 is primarily due to lower salaries and benefits, lower stock-based compensation, lower legal expenses, lower professional fees and lower office expenses. At September 30, 2016, the number of G&A employees declined 13% when compared to September 30, 2015 (excluding the personnel impact of the Memorial Merger). G&A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $22.7 million when compared to the same period prior year due to lower salaries and benefits, lower stock-based compensation, lower public relations costs, lower office expenses and lower legal expenses. On a per mcfe basis, third quarter 2016 G&A expense decreased 14% from third quarter 2015 and 20% from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The following table summarizes G&A expenses per mcfe for the three months ended and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2016        2015        Change        %        2016     2015     Change     %       General and administrative  $  0.22        $  0.26        $  (0.04  )     (15  %)     $  0.22     $  0.30     $  (0.08  )  (27  %)    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.08           0.09           (0.01  )     (11  %)        0.10        0.10        ¾     ¾  %    Total general and administrative expense  $  0.30        $  0.35        $  (0.05  )     (14  %)     $  0.32     $  0.40     $  (0.08  )  (20  %)   Interest expense was $46.0 million for third quarter 2016 compared to $42.9 million for third quarter 2015 and was $121.5 million in the nine months ended 2016 compared to $125.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The following table presents information about interest expense per mcfe for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2016        2015        Change        %        2016     2015     Change     %       Bank credit facility  $  0.03        $  0.03        $  ¾        ¾  %     $  0.02     $  0.03     $  (0.01  )  (33  %)    Senior notes     0.10           0.07           0.03        43  %        0.08        0.04        0.04     100  %    Subordinated notes     0.14           0.20           (0.06  )     (30  %)         0.17        0.24        (0.07  )  (29  %)    Amortization of deferred financing costs and other     0.06           0.02           0.04        200  %        0.04        0.02        0.02     100  %    Total interest expense  $  0.33        $  0.32        $  0.01        3  %      $  0.31     $  0.33     $  (0.02  )  (6  %)      Average debt outstanding (in thousands)  $  2,875,991        $  3,587,772        $  (711,781  )     (20  %)     $  2,768,873     $  3,415,762     $  (646,889  )  (19  %)    Average interest rate (a)     5.2  %        4.6  %        0.6  %     13  %        5.3  %     4.7  %     0.6  %  13  %   (a) Includes commitment fees but excludes debt issue costs and amortization of discounts. On an absolute basis, the increase in interest expense for third quarter 2016 from the same period of 2015 was primarily due to higher average interest rates and senior subordinated debt exchange fees partially offset by lower average outstanding debt balances. In August 2015, we redeemed all of our $500.0 million 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020. In May 2015, we issued $750.0 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2025. The third quarter 2016 includes an additional $6.6 million of transaction costs associated with our senior subordinated note exchange. See Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for third quarter 2016 was $226.1 million compared to $810.8 million in third quarter 2015 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.3% in third quarter 2016 compared to 1.7% in third quarter 2015.  On an absolute basis, the decrease in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the same period of 2015 was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances somewhat offset by higher average interest rates. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $151.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $790.5 million for the same period of 2015 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1.7% in the same period of 2015. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) expense was $131.5 million in third quarter 2016 compared to $154.0 million in third quarter 2015. This decrease is due to a 17% decrease in depletion rates somewhat offset by a 4% increase in production volumes. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $0.91 per mcfe in third quarter 2016 compared to $1.10 per mcfe in third quarter 2015. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on  33  the year-end reserve report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to the mix of our production from our properties with lower depletion rates, impairment of properties in 2015 and early 2016 which reduced our carrying values and asset sales. We do not expect our DD&A rate to be materially impacted by the Memorial acquisition. DD&A expense was $374.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $453.2 million in the same period of 2015. This decrease is due to a 21% decrease in depletion rates somewhat offset by a 4% increase in production volumes. Depletion expense was $0.90 per mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.14 per mcfe in the same period of 2015. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2016        2015        Change        %        2016     2015     Change     %       Depletion and amortization  $  0.91        $  1.10        $  (0.19  )     (17  %)     $  0.90     $  1.14     $  (0.24  )  (21  %)    Depreciation     0.01           0.02           (0.01  )     (50  %)        0.02        0.02        ¾     ¾  %    Accretion and other     0.03           0.04           (0.01  )     (25  %)        0.03        0.04        (0.01  )  (25  %)    Total DD&A expense  $  0.95        $  1.16        $  (0.21  )     (18  %)      $  0.95     $  1.20     $  (0.25  )  (21  %)   Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, Memorial Merger expenses, termination costs, deferred compensation plan expenses and impairment of proved properties. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants, PSUs and SARs grants. The following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation to functional expense categories for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):         Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,          2016        2015        2016     2015       Direct operating expense  $  497        $  609        $  1,781     $  2,149       Brokered natural gas and marketing expense     455           618           1,349        1,743       Exploration expense     608           688           1,669        2,171       General and administrative expense     11,126           11,512           37,682        38,545       Termination costs     ¾           (1  )        ¾        1,720       Total stock-based compensation  $  12,686        $  13,426        $  42,481     $  46,328      Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $44.6 million in third quarter 2016 compared to $32.3 million in third quarter 2015. The increase reflects significantly higher brokered natural gas volumes, higher purchase prices somewhat offset by lower expenses related to company owned gathering lines (which were sold in fourth quarter 2015). Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $122.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $80.9 million in the same period of 2015. The increase reflects significantly higher brokered natural gas volumes and $8.5 million of brokered propane and ethane purchases somewhat offset by lower expenses related to company owned gathering lines (which were sold in fourth quarter 2015) and lower purchase prices. Exploration expense was $6.9 million in third quarter 2016 compared to $4.2 million in third quarter 2015 due to higher delay rental costs. Exploration expense was $18.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $17.1 million in the same period of 2015 due to lower personnel expense partially offset by higher delay rentals. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2016        2015        Change        %        2016     2015     Change     %       Seismic  $  236        $  110        $  126        115  %     $  1,417     $  1,685     $  (268  )  (16  %)    Delay rentals and other     2,804           819           1,985        242  %         7,432        3,577        3,855     108  %    Personnel expense     3,293           2,637           656        25  %         8,121        9,626        (1,505  )  (16  %)    Stock-based compensation expense     608           688           (80  )     (12  %)         1,669        2,171        (502  )  (23  %)    Dry hole expense     2           (19  )        21        111  %        2        87        (85  )  (98  %)    Total exploration expense  $  6,943        $  4,235        $  2,708        64  %     $  18,641     $  17,146     $  1,495     9  %   34  Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $6.1 million in third quarter 2016 compared to $12.4 million in third quarter 2015. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $23.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $36.2 million in the same period of 2015. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.  Memorial Merger expenses of $33.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $36.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 represents amounts paid through September 30, 2016 in connection with the merger with Memorial including consulting, investment banking, advisory, legal and other merger-related fees. See “Memorial Merger” above. Termination costs were $136,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $77,000 in the same period of 2015. Termination costs were $303,000 for nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $6.3 million in the same period of 2015. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, these costs represent additional building lease costs related to the closing of our Oklahoma City office. In 2015, these costs included $3.2 million of accrued building lease costs for our Oklahoma City office, additional severance and stock-based compensation for accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants for both our Oklahoma City office employees and employees from other areas where we determined a need to reduce personnel due to the commodity price environment. Deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of $11.6 million in third quarter 2016 compared to a gain of $43.7 million in third quarter 2015. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price decreased from $43.14 at June 30, 2016 to $38.75 at September 30, 2016. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price decreased from $49.38 at June 30, 2015 to $32.12 at September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, deferred compensation was a loss of $30.2 million compared to a gain of $56.6 million in the same period of 2015. Our stock price increased from $24.61 at December 31, 2015 to $38.75 at September 30, 2016. In the same period of 2015, our stock price decreased from $53.45 at December 31, 2014 to $32.12 at September 30, 2015. Impairment of proved properties was $43.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $502.2 million in both the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We assess our proved natural gas and oil properties whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The cash flows we use to assess proved property impairment includes numerous assumptions including (1) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves (2) results of future drilling activities (3) future commodity prices and (4) increases or decreases in production and capital costs. All inputs are evaluated at each measurement date. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, impairment expense was recorded related to certain of our oil and gas properties in Oklahoma. In the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2015, impairment was recorded related to certain of our oil and gas properties in Northern Oklahoma and our legacy producing assets in Northwest Pennsylvania. Due to falling commodity prices, our analysis of these properties, which included the possibility of a sale of certain of these properties, determined that undiscounted future cash flows were less than their carrying values.  Loss (gain) on the sale of assets was $2.6 million in third quarter 2016 compared to a loss of $681,000 in third quarter 2015. Loss on the sale of assets was $7.5 million in the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $2.1 million for the same period of 2015. In third quarter 2016, we sold certain properties in Western Oklahoma for proceeds of $900,000 and recognized a loss of $2.6 million. In second quarter 2016, we sold certain properties in Western Oklahoma for proceeds of $77.7 million and we recorded a $2.7 million loss, after closing adjustments. In first quarter 2016, we sold our non-operated interest in certain wells and gathering facilities in Northeast Pennsylvania for proceeds of $111.5 million and, after closing adjustments, we recognized a loss of $2.1 million related to this sale. In third quarter 2015, we sold miscellaneous unproved properties and inventory for proceeds of $524,000 resulting in a loss of $681,000. In first six months 2015, we sold miscellaneous unproved and proved properties along with inventory for proceeds of $14.3 million and recognized a gain of $2.7 million. 35  Income tax benefit was $13.7 million in third quarter 2016 compared to $134.8 million in third quarter 2015. For the third quarter, the effective tax rate was 24.6% in 2016 compared to 30.9% in 2015. Income tax benefit was $187.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $174.4 million in the same period of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the effective tax rate was 34.3% compared to 30.8% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In third quarter 2016, we recorded additional tax expense related to the non-deductible Memorial Merger transaction costs. In third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we increased our valuation allowances for state net operating loss carryforwards we do not believe are realizable and decreases to our valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset related to future deferred compensation plan distributions of our senior executives. The 2016 and 2015 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, permanent differences, changes in our valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets associated with senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation, which includes distributions from the deferred compensation plan, is expected to exceed the $1.0 million annual deductible limit provided under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, changes to our valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards and additional tax expense related to the tax impact of excess financial accounting compensation expense over the corresponding corporate income tax deduction for equity compensation awards that have fully vested. There is no additional paid-in capital pool available to offset these reduced tax benefits. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 38% for the remainder of 2016, before any discrete tax items. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and because our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year-to-year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. As of September 30, 2016, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 128.7 Bcfe for the remainder of 2016, 288.9 Bcfe for 2017 and 26.6 Bcfe for 2018. We have also entered into natural gas basis hedges for 59,385,000 Mmbtus through December 2017 and propane spread swaps for 525,000 barrels in 2016 and 1,837,500 barrels in 2017. 36  The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):                   Nine Months Ended September 30,             2016           2015       Sources of cash and cash equivalents                         Operating activities  $  202,037        $  515,560       Disposal of assets     191,834           14,825       Borrowing on credit facility     1,887,000           1,940,000       Issuance of debt     ¾           750,000       Memorial Merger, net of cash acquired     7,180           ¾       Other     48,717           36,106       Total sources of cash and cash equivalents  $  2,336,768        $  3,256,491                                 Uses of cash and cash equivalents                         Additions to natural gas and oil properties  $  (339,446  )     $  (901,227  )    Repayment of debt     (273,011  )        (516,875  )    Acreage purchases     (29,203  )        (61,213  )    Other property     (1,542  )        (2,878  )    Repayments on credit facility     (1,045,000  )        (1,676,000  )    Repayment of Memorial credit facility     (597,000  )        ¾       Dividends paid     (11,654  )        (20,308  )    Other     (39,841  )        (77,948  )    Total uses of cash and cash equivalents  $  (2,336,697  )     $  (3,256,449  )   Net cash provided from operating activities in first nine months 2016 was $202.0 million compared to $515.6 million in first nine months 2015. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities from 2015 to 2016 reflects a 4% increase in production and lower operating costs more than offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 37%), expenses related to the Memorial Merger and costs related to the senior subordinated note exchange. As of September 30, 2016, we have hedged more than 80% of our projected total production for the remainder of 2016, with more than 80% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first nine months 2016 were negative $51.8 million compared to positive $4.1 million for first nine months 2015.  Disposal of assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $78.6 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain Western Oklahoma properties which closed in May and July, 2016 and $111.5 million of proceeds received from the sale of our non-operated interest in certain wells and gathering facilities in Northeast Pennsylvania which closed in March 2016. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes $10.5 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain of our West Texas properties which closed in February 2015. Issuance of debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes the issuance of $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2025. Repayment of debt in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the cash paid for the cash tender offer and cash tender premium for the senior notes assumed in the Memorial Merger. The nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes the redemption of our 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020 at 103.375% of par. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first nine months 2016, we significantly reduced our operating costs per unit of production and we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2016, 2017 and 2018 to protect future cash flows. In March 2016, our borrowing base and credit facility commitment were reaffirmed through May 1, 2017.  37  During first nine months 2016, our net cash provided from operating activities of $202.0 million and the proceeds we received from asset sales were used to fund approximately $370.2 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). Cash payments for capital expenditures in the first nine months 2016 include payments for services incurred in the prior year capital budget. At September 30, 2016, we had $542,000 in cash and total assets of $11.3 billion.  Long-term debt at September 30, 2016 totaled $3.9 billion, including $937.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility, $2.9 billion of senior notes and $49.0 million of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at September 30, 2016 was $809.1 million. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A further material decline in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and operate profitably. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year, taking into account various factors including the commodity price environment. Our 2016 capital budget, excluding the Memorial Merger, is $495.0 million. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Credit Arrangements  As of September 30, 2016, we maintained a revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of $2.0 billion, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility, during a non-investment grade period, is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of October 16, 2019. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. Availability under the bank credit facility, during an investment grade period, is limited to aggregate lender commitments. As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance under our credit facility was $937.0 million. Additionally, we had $253.9 million of undrawn letters of credit leaving $809.1 million of committed borrowing capacity available under the facility at the end of third quarter 2016.  Our bank credit facility imposes limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under our bank credit facility). These agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, investments and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2016. See Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our bank debt. Cash Dividend Payments  In February 2016, the Board of Directors approved a reduction of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.02 per share. On September 1, 2016, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of two cents per share ($4.9 million) on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on September 30, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 16, 2016. The amount of future dividends is subject to discretionary declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors.  Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation and gathering commitments. As of September 30, 2016, we do not have any capital leases. As of September 30, 2016, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of September 30, 2016, we had a total of $253.9 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2015, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $842.0 million increase in our outstanding bank credit facility balance and additional firm transportation, gathering and new delivery commitments in connection with the start-up of Mariner East and the Memorial Merger. Our contractual obligations for firm transportation and gathering contracts increased by approximately $2.8 billion over the next fifteen years.   38  In conjunction with the Memorial Merger, we have various midstream service agreements in North Louisiana for gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas and NGLs. Pursuant to the gas processing agreement, we must pay a quarterly deficiency payment based on the firm-commitment fixed fee if the cumulative minimum volume commitment as of the end of a quarter exceeds the sum of (i) the cumulative volumes processed under the processing agreement as of the end of the quarter plus (ii) volumes corresponding to deficiency payments incurred prior to each quarter. All net costs associated with these agreements are reflected in transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives, as we typically utilize commodity swap and option contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our on-going development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. The fair value of these contracts which is represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination is based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX for natural gas and oil or Mont Belvieu for NGLs, approximated a pretax gain of $150.9 million at September 30, 2016. The contracts expire monthly through December 2018. At September 30, 2016, the following commodity-based derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed separately below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price                           Natural Gas                      2016     Swaps (1)     901,739 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.32    2017     Swaps (1)     478,192 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.14    2018     Swaps     70,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 2.92    2016     Collar (1)     32,609 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.00-$ 4.71    2017     Collar (1)     34,521 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.00-$ 5.06    2016     Purchased Put (1)     218,478 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.54 (2)    2017     Purchased Put (1)     175,890 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.48 (3)                           Crude Oil                      2016     Swaps (1)     8,640 bbls/day     $ 69.49    2017     Swaps (1)     5,416 bbls/day     $ 57.18    2018     Swaps     500 bbls/day     $ 54.25    2016     Collar (1)     848 bbls/day     $ 80.00-$ 99.70                           NGLs (C2-Ethane)                      2016     Swaps (1)     5,839 bbls/day     $ 0.46/gallon    2017     Swaps     3,000 bbls/day     $ 0.27/gallon                             NGLs (C3-Propane)                      2016     Swaps (1)     11,142 bbls/day     $ 0.75/gallon    2017     Swaps     6,966 bbls/day     $ 0.52/gallon                             NGLs (iC4-isobutane)                      2016     Swaps (1)     1,969 bbls/day     $ 1.21/gallon                             NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                      2016     Swaps (1)     6,071 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon    2017     Swaps     1,500 bbls/day     $ 0.65/gallon      NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                      2016     Swaps (1)     8,142 bbls/day     $ 1.36/gallon    2017     Swaps     2,000 bbls/day     $ 0.98/gallon   (1) Includes derivative instruments assumed in connection with the Memorial Merger. (2) Weighted average deferred premium is ($0.34). (3) Weighted average deferred premium is ($0.32). 39  In addition to the swaps discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we received for our natural gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a gain of $13.8 million at September 30, 2016. The volumes are for 59,385,000 Mmbtu and they expire through December 2017. At September 30, 2016, we also had propane spread swap contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. These contracts settle monthly through December 2017 and include total volume of 525,000 barrels in 2016 and 1,837,500 barrels in 2017. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $4.1 million on September 30, 2016. Interest Rates  At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $3.9 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $937.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 2.0% at September 30, 2016. The 30-day LIBOR Rate on September 30, 2016 was approximately 0.5%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2016 would cost us approximately $9.4 million in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any significant off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments, some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2016 to continue to be a function of supply and demand and we believe, based on a continuing lower commodity price environment, we expect to see continued cost reductions. However, the timing and amount of such cost reductions cannot be predicted.  Critical Accounting Estimates On September 16, 2016, we issued approximately 77.0 million shares of common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Memorial using an exchange ratio of 0.375 of a share of Range common stock for each share of Memorial common stock. In connection with the allocation of purchase price for this merger, approximately $1.6 billion has been recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below carrying value. The impairment test requires allocating goodwill and other assets and liabilities to a reporting unit level. The fair value of a reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the book value, including goodwill, then the recorded goodwill is impaired to its implied fair value with a charge to impairment expense. We assess goodwill for impairment annually on November 1, or more frequently as circumstances require. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which is represented by our oil and natural gas operations in the United States.    ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide  40  prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Changes in natural gas prices affect us more than changes in oil prices because approximately 63% of our December 31, 2015 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016.  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program can also include collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. At September 30, 2016, our derivative program includes swaps and options. These contracts expire monthly through December 2018. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of September 30, 2016, approximated a net unrealized pretax gain of $150.9 million. At September 30, 2016, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price     Fair MarketValue                               (in thousands)       Natural Gas                                  2016     Swaps (1)     901,739 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.32     $  26,845       2017     Swaps (1)     478,192 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.14     $  9,536       2018     Swaps      70,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 2.92     $  132       2016     Collar (1)      32,609 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.00-$ 4.71     $  2,982       2017     Collar (1)      34,521 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.00-$ 5.06     $  12,104       2016     Purchased Put (1)     218,478 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.54 (2)     $  11,747       2017     Purchased Put (1)     175,890 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.48 (3)     $  39,045                                          Crude Oil                                  2016     Swaps (1)     8,640 bbls/day     $ 69.49     $  16,235       2017     Swaps (1)     5,416 bbls/day     $ 57.18     $  10,886       2018     Swaps      500 bbls/day     $ 54.25     $  119       2016     Collar (1)      848 bbls/day     $ 80.00-$ 99.70     $  2,416                                          NGLs (C2-Ethane)                                  2016     Swaps (1)     5,839 bbls/day     $ 0.46/gallon     $  5,348       2017     Swaps     3,000 bbls/day     $ 0.27/gallon     $  798                                          NGLs (C3-Propane)                                  2016     Swaps (1)     11,142 bbls/day     $ 0.75/gallon     $  8,508       2017     Swaps      6,966 bbls/day     $ 0.52/gallon     $  (3,511  )                                       NGLs (iC4-isobutane)                                  2016     Swaps (1)     1,969 bbls/day     $ 1.21/gallon     $  3,557                                          NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                                  2016     Swaps (1)     6,071 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon     $  48       2017     Swaps     1,500 bbls/day     $ 0.65/gallon     $  (1,173  )                                       NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                                  2016     Swaps (1)     8,142 bbls/day     $ 1.36/gallon     $  8,726       2017     Swaps     2,000 bbls/day     $ 0.98/gallon     $  (3,451  )   (1) Includes derivative instruments assumed in connection with the Memorial Merger. (2) Weighted average deferred premium is ($0.34). (3) Weighted average deferred premium is ($0.32). 41  In the future, we expect our NGLs production to continue to increase. We believe NGLs prices are somewhat seasonal, particularly for propane. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional and international markets. If we are not able to sell or store NGLs, we may be required to curtail production or shift our drilling activities to dry gas areas. Currently, the Appalachian region has limited local demand and infrastructure to accommodate ethane. We have previously announced three ethane agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. Our Mariner East transportation agreement and our terminal/storage arrangements at Sunoco’s Marcus Hook Industrial Complex facility near Philadelphia began ethane operations late in first quarter 2016. We cannot assure you that these facilities will remain available. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these agreements, we may be required to curtail production or, as we have in the past, purchase or divert natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. Therefore, in addition to the swaps discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of basis adjustments, relative quality and other factors. Basis swap agreements effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the natural gas basis swaps was a gain of $13.8 million at September 30, 2016 and they settle monthly through December 2017. At September 30, 2016, we also had propane basis spread contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. The contracts settle monthly through December 2017 and include a total volume of 525,000 barrels in 2016 and 1,837,500 barrels in 2017. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $4.1 million on September 30, 2016. The following table shows the fair value of our swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical changes in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at September 30, 2016. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                       Hypothetical Changein Fair Value        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value                         Increase of        Decrease of             Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%       Swaps     $  82,603        $  (111,809  )     $  (279,140  )     $  112,679        $  281,911       Collars        17,502           (4,126  )        (9,776  )        4,391           11,367       Puts        50,792           (13,638  )        (28,143  )        16,674           46,517       Basis swaps        17,867           10           174           (102  )        (268  )    Freight swap        (155  )        66           163           (65  )        (163  )   Our commodity-based derivative contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified primarily among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At September 30, 2016, our derivative counterparties include twenty-four financial institutions, of which all but six are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are primarily major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial. Our propane sales from the Marcus Hook facility near Philadelphia are short-term and are to a single purchaser. Ethane sales from Marcus Hook are to a single international customer bearing a credit rating similar to Range. Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior and senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At September 30, 2016, we had $3.9 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $937.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 2.0% on September 30, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the 30-day LIBOR Rate was approximately 0.5%. A 1% increase in  42  short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2016, would cost us approximately $9.4 million in additional annual interest expense.      ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 15 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part I Item 1 above for a summary of our legal proceedings, such information being incorporated herein by reference.  Environmental Proceedings Our subsidiary, Range Resources – Appalachia, LLC, was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”), in the second quarter of 2015, that it intends to assess a civil penalty under the Clean Streams Law and the 2012 Oil and Gas Act in connection with one well in Lycoming County. The DEP has directed us to prevent methane and other substances from escaping from this gas well into groundwater and a stream. We have considerable evidence that this well is not leaking and pre-drill testing of surrounding water wells showed the presence of methane in the water before commencement of our operations. While we intend to vigorously assert this position with the DEP; resolution of this matter may nonetheless result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.     ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.     ITEM 6.  EXHIBITS
