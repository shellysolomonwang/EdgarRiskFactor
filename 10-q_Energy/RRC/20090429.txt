Item 1A. Risk Factors, in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Except where noted, discussions in this report relate only to our continuing operations.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. These policies and estimates are described in the 2008 Form 10-K except as updated below. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: accounting for oil and gas revenue, oil and gas properties, stock-based compensation, derivative financial instruments, asset retirement obligations and deferred taxes.   We adhere to SFAS No. 19 “Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies,” for recognizing impairment of capitalized costs related to unproved properties. These costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated (at least quarterly) as to recoverability based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management. We consider time, geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs. We continue to experience an increase in lease expirations and impairment expense caused by current economic conditions, which have impacted our future drilling plans thereby increasing the amount of expected lease expirations, and our rapid expansion of our unproved property positions in new shale plays. As economic conditions change and we continue to prove up unproved properties, our estimates of expirations likely will change and we may increase or decrease impairment expense.  Results of Continuing Operations  Overview   Total revenues increased $71.1 million, or 35% for first quarter 2009 over the same period of 2008. The increase includes a $199.3 million increase in derivative fair value income offset by a $104.2 million, or 34% decrease in oil and gas sales. Oil and gas sales vary due to changes in volumes of production sold and realized commodity prices. For first quarter 2009, production increased 12% from the same period of the prior year with the continued success of our drilling program. Realized prices were 31% lower in first quarter 2009 when compared to first quarter 2008. We believe oil and gas prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new regulations and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide.   As a result of the significant drop in commodity prices, we continue to implement initiatives to reduce capital spending and operating costs. This plan includes reduced drilling activities until margins improve as a result of (i) increased commodity prices (ii) reduced gas price differentials relative to NYMEX quoted prices in the areas where we produce and/or (iii) decreased well costs. In the first quarter of 2009, we experienced some cost savings caused by lower commodity prices but operating costs have not decreased at the same rate as commodity prices. Therefore on average, most of our expenses increased on both an absolute and per mcfe basis. Our operating teams continue to implement initiatives to reduce controllable production costs. We expect to see further cost reductions in 2009, as we expect lower spending levels in the industry will reduce demand for goods and services and eventually lower costs, but we are uncertain how quickly costs will decline and by how much. However, as we continue to expand our Marcellus Shale team to meet the needs of this developing asset, we expect to see upward pressure on our general and administrative costs per mcfe.  20    Table of Contents  Oil and Gas Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculation   Our oil and gas sales vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and volumes of production sold. Hedges included in oil and gas sales reflect settlement on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Cash settlement of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in the income statement caption called “Derivative fair value income (loss).” The following table summarizes the primary components of oil and gas sales for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):                                              Three Months Ended March 31,         2009     2008     Change     %       Oil wellhead   $ 28,080     $ 71,419     $ (43,339 )     -61 %   Oil hedges realized     9,365       (15,392 )     24,757       161 %                                 Total oil revenue     37,445       56,027       (18,582 )     -33 %                                                                     Gas wellhead     116,920       214,516       (97,596 )     -45 %   Gas hedges realized     41,958       20,574       21,384       104 %                                 Total gas revenue     158,878       235,090       (76,212 )     -32 %                                                                     NGL     6,866       16,267       (9,401 )     -58 %                                                                     Combined wellhead     151,866       302,202       (150,336 )     -50 %   Combined hedges     51,323       5,182       46,141       890 %                                 Total oil and gas sales   $ 203,189     $ 307,384     $ (104,195 )     -34 %                                    Our production continues to grow through continued drilling success as we place new wells into production.

Our production for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 is shown below:                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2009     2008       Production:                   Crude oil (bbls)     721,960       754,545     NGLs (bbls)     423,261       312,500     Natural gas (mcf)     30,552,333       27,322,774     Total (mcfe)(a)     37,423,659       33,725,044                         Average daily production:                   Crude oil (bbls)     8,022       8,292     NGLs (bbls)     4,703       3,434     Natural gas (mcf)     339,470       300,250     Total (mcfe)(a)     415,818       370,605                  (a)   Oil and NGLs are converted at the rate of one barrel equals six mcfe.   21    Table of Contents   Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements) received for oil and gas was $6.62 per mcfe in first quarter 2009 compared to $9.55 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Our average realized price calculation (including all derivative settlements) includes all cash settlement for derivatives, whether or not they qualify for hedge accounting. Average price calculations for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 are shown below:                              Three Months Ended       March 31,       2009   2008     Average sales prices (wellhead):                   Crude oil (per bbl)   $ 38.89     $ 94.65     NGLs (per bbl)   $ 16.22     $ 52.06     Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 3.82     $ 7.85     Total (per mcfe)(a)   $ 4.06     $ 8.96                         Average realized price (including derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting):                   Crude oil (per bbl)   $ 51.87     $ 74.25     NGLs (per bbl)   $ 16.22     $ 52.06     Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 5.20     $ 8.60     Total (per mcfe)(a)   $ 5.43     $ 9.11                         Average realized price (including all derivative settlements):                   Crude oil (per bbl)   $ 59.64     $ 70.25     NGLs (per bbl)   $ 16.22     $ 52.06     Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 6.47     $ 9.25     Total (per mcfe)(a)   $ 6.62     $ 9.55                         Average NYMEX prices(b)                   Oil (per bbl)   $ 43.20     $ 97.90     Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 4.86     $ 8.07                  (a)   Oil and NGLs are converted at the rate of one barrel equals six mcfe.

Derivative fair value income (loss) includes income of $75.5 million in first quarter 2009 compared to a loss of $123.8 million in the same period of 2008. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but are, to a degree, economic hedges of our commodity price exposure. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. All unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in the income statement caption “Derivative fair value income (loss).” We have also entered into basis swap agreements, which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are also marked to market. Not using hedge accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from non-hedge derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in our balance sheet caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Due to falling commodity prices in first quarter 2009 for oil and natural gas, we reported a non-cash unrealized mark-to-market gain from our oil and gas derivatives of $31.5 million. If commodity prices for oil and natural gas continue to fall, we would expect to incur additional realized and non-cash unrealized gains from our oil and gas hedges. If this occurs, our results of operations, net income and earnings per share may be affected. Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in this income statement category, is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133.  22    Table of Contents   The following table presents information about the components of derivative fair value income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):                              Three Months Ended         March 31,         2009     2008       Hedge ineffectiveness – realized(c)   $ 497     $ 705     – unrealized(a)     (453 )     (3,249 )   Change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting(a)     31,525       (135,221 )   Realized gain on settlements – gas(b) (c)     38,372       16,584     Realized gain (loss) on settlements – oil(b)(c)     5,606       (2,586 )                   Derivative fair value income (loss)   $ 75,547     $ (123,767 )                                (a)   These amounts are unrealized and are not included in average sales price calculations.     (b)   These amounts represent realized gains and losses on settled derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.     (c)   These settlements are included in average realized price calculations (including all derivative settlements).    Other revenue for first quarter 2009 decreased to a loss of $1.8 million from a gain of $20.6 million in the same period of 2008. First quarter 2009 includes a loss from equity investments of $919,000. First quarter 2008 includes a gain of $20.7 million from the sale of certain East Texas properties and a loss from equity method investments of $275,000.   Our costs, on an absolute basis, have increased as we continue to grow. We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about these expenses on an mcfe basis for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008:                                              Three Months Ended March 31,                               %       2009   2008   Change   Change     Direct operating expense   $ 0.95     $ 0.98     $ (0.03 )     -3 %   Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.22       0.41       (0.19 )     -46 %   General and administrative expense     0.67       0.52       0.15       29 %   Interest expense     0.71       0.69       0.02       3 %   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     2.25       2.08       0.17       8 %      Direct operating expense increased $2.6 million in first quarter 2009 to $35.5 million due to higher volumes. Our operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells from development and maintain production from our existing properties. We incurred $1.7 million ($0.05 per mcfe) of workover costs in first quarter 2009 versus $1.9 million ($0.06 per mcfe) in 2008. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses for first quarter 2009 decreased $0.03 or 3% from the same period of 2008 with the decrease consisting primarily of lower workover costs ($0.01 per mcfe), lower utility costs along with lower overall industry costs. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008:                                              Three Months Ended March 31,                                 %         2009     2008     Change     Change       Lease operating expense   $ 0.88     $ 0.90     $ (0.02 )     -2 %   Workovers     0.05       0.06       (0.01 )     -17 %   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.02       0.02       —       - %                                 Total direct operating expenses   $ 0.95     $ 0.98     $ (0.03 )     -3 %                                   23    Table of Contents   Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. For the first quarter, these taxes decreased $5.6 million or 40% from the same period of the prior year due to the significant decline in pre-hedge prices. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes decreased to $0.22 in first quarter 2009 from $0.41 in the same period of 2008 primarily due to a 55% decrease in pre-hedge prices.   General and administrative expense for first quarter 2009 increased $7.5 million from the first quarter of the prior year due primarily to higher salaries and benefits ($4.2 million) due to our continued expansion of our Marcellus Shale team, higher stock-based compensation ($1.5 million) and higher office expenses, including rent and information technology. The stock-based compensation represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for first quarter of 2009 and 2008:                                              Three Months Ended March 31,                                 %         2009     2008     Change     Change       General and administrative   $ 0.50     $ 0.38     $ 0.12       32 %   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.17       0.14       0.03       21 %                                 Total general and administrative expenses   $ 0.67     $ 0.52     $ 0.15       29 %                                    Interest expense for first quarter 2009 increased $3.5 million to $26.6 million due to the refinancing of certain debt from floating to higher fixed rates in second quarter 2008 combined with higher overall debt balances. In May 2008, we issued $250.0 million of 7.25% Notes due 2018, which added $4.5 million of interest costs in first quarter 2009. The proceeds from the issuance were used to retire lower interest bank debt, to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for first quarter 2009 was $787.2 million compared to $539.8 million for first quarter 2008 and the weighted average interest rates were 2.6% in first quarter 2009 compared to 5.0% in first quarter 2008.   Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) increased $14.2 million, or 20%, to $84.3 million in first quarter 2009 with a 12% increase in production and a 7% increase in depletion rates. On a per mcfe basis, DD&A increased from $2.08 in first quarter 2008 to $2.25 in first quarter 2009. The increase in DD&A per mcfe is related to increasing drilling costs, higher acquisition costs and the mix of our production. The following table summarizes DD&A expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008:                                              Three Months Ended March 31,                                 %         2009     2008     Change     Change       Depletion and amortization   $ 2.09     $ 1.95     $ 0.14       7 %   Depreciation     0.12       0.10       0.02       20 %   Accretion and other     0.04       0.03       0.01       33 %                                 Total DD&A expense   $ 2.25     $ 2.08     $ 0.17       8 %                                    Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties and deferred compensation plan expenses. In the three months ended March 31, 2008 and 2009, stock-based compensation represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and expenses related to SAR grants. In first quarter 2009, stock-based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($730,000), exploration expense ($1.1 million) and general and administrative expense ($6.2 million) for a total of $8.3 million. In first quarter 2008, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($578,000), exploration expense ($1.1 million) and general and administrative expense ($4.6 million) for a total of $6.4 million.  24    Table of Contents   Exploration expense decreased $3.3 million in first quarter 2009 primarily due to lower dry hole costs. The following table details our exploration-related expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):                                              Three Months Ended March 31,                                 %         2009     2008     Change     Change       Dry hole expense   $ 123     $ 4,968     $ (4,845 )     -98 %   Seismic     8,198       6,744       1,454       22 %   Personnel expense     2,856       2,638       218       8 %   Stock-based compensation expense     1,074       1,089       (15 )     -1 %   Delay rentals and other     1,088       1,154       (66 )     -6 %                                 Total exploration expense   $ 13,339     $ 16,593     $ (3,254 )     -20 %                                    Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties expense was $19.6 million in first quarter 2009 compared to $1.4 million in the same period of the prior year. We continue to experience increases in lease expirations and impairment expenses caused by current economic conditions which have impacted our future drilling plans and our rapid expansion of our unproved property positions in new shale plays.   Deferred compensation plan expense was $12.4 million compared to $20.6 million in the same period of the prior year. Our stock price increased from $34.39 at December 31, 2008 to $41.16 at March 31, 2009. During the same period in the prior year, our stock price increased from $51.36 at December 31, 2007 to $63.45 at March 31, 2008. This non-cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of our common stock that is vested and held in the deferred compensation plan. Our deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense.   Income tax expense for the first quarter 2009 increased to $18.8 million, reflecting a 458% increase in income from operations before taxes compared to the same period of 2008. First quarter 2009 provided for tax expense at an effective rate of 36.6% compared to tax expense at an effective rate of 81.1% in the same period of 2008. First quarter 2008 included $3.8 million of additional tax expense for discrete items. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 37% for the remainder of 2009.  Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with both uncommitted and committed availability, asset sales and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. During the last six months, we have taken several steps to improve our liquidity as a result of the deterioration in the capital markets and the decrease in oil and gas commodity prices. In December 2008, we elected to utilize the expansion option under our bank credit facility and increased our credit facility commitment by $250.0 million which made the current bank commitment $1.25 billion. In March 2009, we completed our semi-annual borrowing base redetermination with our bank group reaffirming our $1.5 million borrowing base. We have announced a $700.0 million 2009 capital budget, which reflects reduced spending all areas except the Marcellus Shale play. We are currently considering the possible sale of certain oil properties in West Texas as well as properties in other areas.   During the three months ended March 31, 2009, our cash provided from continuing operations was $149.2 million and we spent $169.8 million on capital expenditures and $84.4 million of acreage purchases. During this period, financing activities provided net cash of $100.9 million. At March 31, 2009, we had $756,000 in cash, total assets of $5.7 billion and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 43.2%. Long-term debt at March 31, 2009 totaled $1.9 billion including $807.0 million of bank credit facility debt and $1.1 billion of senior subordinated notes. Available committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility at March 31, 2009 was $443.0 million.   Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves, which is typical in the capital-intensive oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. Sustained lower oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce  25    Table of Contents  our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We currently have not entered into any hedging agreements for 2010 and beyond except for a limited amount of basis swaps. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices, which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.   Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Credit Arrangements   On March 31, 2009, the bank credit facility had a $1.5 billion borrowing base and a $1.25 billion facility amount. The borrowing base represents an amount approved by the bank group that can be borrowed based on our assets, while our $1.25 billion facility amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the credit agreement. Remaining credit availability is $368.0 million on April 24, 2009. Our bank group is comprised of twenty-six commercial banks, with no one bank holding more than 5.0% of the bank credit facility. We believe our large number of banks and relatively low hold levels allow for significant lending capacity should we elect to increase our $1.25 billion commitment up to the $1.5 billion borrowing base and also allow for flexibility should there be additional consolidation within the banking sector.   Our bank credit facility and our indentures governing our senior subordinated notes all contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and incur additional indebtedness. We were in compliance with these covenants at March 31, 2009. Please see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.  Cash Flow   Cash flows from operations primarily are affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital. We sell substantially all of our oil and gas production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. However, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next 12 to 24 months. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowing under the credit facility. As of March 31, 2009, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 92.3 Bcfe for 2009.   Net cash provided from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $149.2 million compared to $206.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2008. Cash flow from operations was lower than the prior year with higher production from development activity and acquisitions more than offset by lower prices. Net cash provided from continuing operations is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows) in the three months ended March 31, 2009 was a positive $1.7 million compared to a negative $24.7 million in the same period of the prior year.   Net cash used in investing for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $250.1 million compared to $485.2 million in the same period of 2008. The 2009 period included $159.2 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $84.4 million of acreage purchases. Acquisitions for the first three months of 2009 include the purchase of certain Marcellus Shale leasehold acreage for $56.7 million. The 2008 period included $207.1 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $333.4 million of acquisitions and other investments, offset by proceeds of $63.3 million from asset sales.   Net cash provided from financing for the three months ended March 31, 2009 was $100.9 million compared to $275.0 million in the first three months of 2008. This decrease was primarily due to the lower borrowings on our bank credit facility. During the first three months of 2009, total debt increased $114.1 million.  26    Table of Contents  Dividends   On March 3, 2009, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.3 million) on our common stock, which was paid on March 31, 2009 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2009.  Capital Requirements, Contractual Cash Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   The 2009 capital budget is currently set at $700.0 million (excluding proved property acquisitions) and based on current projections, is expected to be funded with internal cash flow. We may, from time to time during 2009, make borrowings under our credit facility but expect that for all of 2009 to require no significant incremental borrowings from ending 2008 levels. Acreage purchases during the year include $56.7 million of purchases in the Marcellus Shale and $6.4 million in the Barnett Shale which were funded with borrowings under the credit facility. For the three months ended March 31, 2009, $178.9 million of development and exploration spending was funded with internal cash flow and borrowings under our bank credit facility. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting the amount up or down and between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestiture and continued growth. We may sell assets, issue subordinated notes or other debt securities, or issue additional shares of stock to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions, extend maturities or repay debt.   Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, transportation commitments and other liabilities. Since December 31, 2008, the material changes to our contractual obligations included a $114.1 million increase in long-term debt and an increase in our transportation commitments (see table and discussion below).   We have entered into firm transportation contracts with various pipelines. Under these contracts, we are obligated to transport minimum daily gas volumes, as calculated on a monthly basis, or pay for any deficiencies at a specified reservation fee rate. As of March 31, 2009, future minimum transportation fees under our gas transportation commitments were as follows (in thousands):                    2009 remaining   $ 23,002     2010     29,790     2011     29,308     2012     26,348     2013     25,476     Thereafter     185,587       Other Contingencies   We are involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or consolidated financial position.  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices   We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. These contracts consist of collars and fixed price swaps. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At March 31, 2009, we had open swaps contracts covering 24.6 Bcf of gas at prices averaging $7.47 per mcf. We also have collars covering 54.5 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $7.39 and $8.01 per mcf and 2.2 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $64.01 and $76.00 per barrel. Their fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination, based on a comparison of contract prices and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on March 31, 2009 was a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $274.6 million. The contracts expire monthly through December 2009. Settled transaction gains and losses for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases in oil and gas sales in the period the hedged production is sold. In the first three months of 2009, oil and gas sales included realized hedging gains of $51.3 million compared to gains of $5.2 million in the same period of 2008.  27    Table of Contents   At March 31, 2009, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                  Average   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Hedge Price     Natural Gas               2009    Swaps    89,436 Mmbtu/day    $7.47   2009    Collars    198,255 Mmbtu/day    $7.39-$ 8.01                   Crude Oil               2009    Collars    8,000 bbl/day    $64.01-$ 76.00      Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but are, to a degree, economic hedges of our commodity price exposure. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value on our balance sheet under the captions “Unrealized derivative gains and losses.” We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in our income statement caption called “Derivative fair value income (loss).” As of March 31, 2009, derivatives on 49.7 Bcfe no longer qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting.   In addition to the swaps and collars above, we have entered into basis swap agreements that do not qualify as hedges for hedge accounting purposes and are marked to market. The price we receive for our production can be less than NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $5.8 million at March 31, 2009.  Interest Rates   At March 31, 2009, we had $1.9 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.1 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.3%. Bank debt totaling $807.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 2.6% at March 31, 2009. The 30 day LIBOR rate on March 31, 2009 was 0.5%.  Debt Ratings   We receive debt credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group, Inc. (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. (“Moody’s”), which are subject to regular reviews. S&P’s rating for us is BB with a stable outlook. Moody’s rating for us is Ba2 with a stable outlook. We believe that S&P and Moody’s consider many factors in determining our ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels, asset, and proved reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing.  Inflation and Changes in Prices   Our revenues, the value of our assets, our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. During first quarter 2009, we received an average of $38.89 per barrel of oil and $3.82 per mcf of gas before derivative contracts compared to $94.65 per barrel of oil and $7.85 per mcf of gas in the same period of the prior year. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and continued through the first six months of 2008, commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly. The higher prices led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on capital costs. The last half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 saw sharp declines in commodity prices and while we have realized some cost savings, operating costs have not decreased at the same rate as commodity prices. We expect to see further cost reductions in 2009 but we are uncertain how quickly costs will decline and by how much. Except for certain basis swaps, we currently do not have any oil or gas derivative contracts in place for 2010 or beyond.  Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted   In December 2008, the SEC announced that it had approved revisions to its oil and gas reporting disclosures. The new disclosure requirements include provisions that:  28    Table of Contents       •   Introduce a new definition of oil and gas producing activities. This new definition allows companies to include in their reserve base volumes from unconventional resources. Such unconventional resources include bitumen extracted from oil sands and oil and gas extracted from coal beds and shale formations.        •   Report oil and gas reserves using an unweighted average price using the prior 12-month period, based on the closing prices on the first day of each month, rather than year-end prices. The SEC indicated that they will continue to communicate with the FASB staff to align their accounting standards with these rules. The FASB currently requires a single-day, year-end price for accounting purposes.        •   Permit companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves on a voluntary basis. In the past, proved reserves were the only reserves allowed in the disclosures.        •   Requires companies to provide additional disclosure regarding the aging of proved undeveloped reserves.        •   Permit the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes.        •   Replace the existing “certainty” test for areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a productive well with a “reasonable certainty” test.        •   Require additional disclosures regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the company’s overall reserve estimation process. Additionally, disclosures regarding internal controls over reserve estimation, as well as a report addressing the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor will be mandatory.     We will begin complying with the disclosure requirements in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. The new rules may not be applied to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required. We are currently in the process of evaluating the new requirements.  29    Table of Contents     Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposures. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Financial Market Risk   The debt and equity markets have recently exhibited adverse conditions. The unprecedented volatility and upheaval in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets. At this point, we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent events in the global markets and we do not expect our liquidity to be materially impacted in the near future. We will continue to monitor our liquidity and the capital markets. Additionally, we will continue to monitor events and circumstances surrounding each of our twenty-six lenders in the bank credit facility.  Market Risk   Our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Except for a limited number of basis swaps, we currently do not have any oil or gas derivative contracts in place for 2010 or beyond (see discussion below).  Commodity Price Risk   We periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production. These arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. Certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. Historically, we applied hedge accounting to derivatives utilized to manage price risk associated with our oil and gas production. Accordingly, we recorded change in the fair value of our swap and collar contracts under the balance sheet caption “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” and into oil and gas sales when the forecasted sale of production occurred. Any hedge ineffectiveness associated with contracts qualifying for and designated as a cash flow hedge is reported currently each period under the income statement caption “Derivative fair value income (loss).” Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but are, to a degree, economic hedges of our commodity price exposure. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheet under the captions “Unrealized derivative gains and losses.” We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in our income statement under the caption “Derivative fair value income (loss).” Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Our derivative counterparties include twelve financial institutions, ten of which are in our bank group. Mitsui & Co. and J. Aron & Company are the two counterparties not in our bank group. At March 31, 2009, our net derivative asset includes a receivable from J. Aron & Company of $517,000 and a receivable from Mitsui & Co. for $19.8 million. None of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that would require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date.   As of March 31, 2009, we had swaps in place covering 24.6 Bcf of gas. We also had collars covering 54.5 Bcf of gas and 2.2 million barrels of oil. These contracts expire monthly through December 2009. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of March 31, 2009, approximated a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $274.6 million.  30    Table of Contents   At March 31, 2009, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                          Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Average Hedge Price   Fair Market Value                   (in thousands)     Natural Gas                   2009    Swaps    89,436 Mmbtu/day    $7.47    $ 78,852   2009    Collars    198,255 Mmbtu/day    $7.39-$ 8.01    $171,035      Crude Oil                   2009    Collars    8,000 bbl/day    $64.01-$ 76.00    $ 24,758     Other Commodity Risk   We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. In addition to the collars and swaps detailed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements, which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market. The price we receive for our gas production can be less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a net realized pre-tax gain of $5.8 million at March 31, 2009.   The following table shows the fair value of our swaps and collars and the hypothetical change in the fair value that would result from a 10% change in commodity prices at March 31, 2009. The hypothetical change in fair value would be a gain or loss depending on whether prices increase or decrease (in thousands):                                      Hypothetical               Change               in Fair       Fair Value   Value     Swaps   $ 78,852     $ 10,000     Collars   $ 195,793     $ 32,000        Interest rate risk. At March 31, 2009, we had $1.9 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.1 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.3%. Senior bank debt totaling $807.0 million bore interest at floating rates averaging 2.6%. A 1% increase or decrease in short-term interest rates would affect interest expense by approximately $8.1 million per year.     Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting us to material information required to be included in this report. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  31    Table of Contents     Part II. – OTHER INFORMATION     Item 6.
