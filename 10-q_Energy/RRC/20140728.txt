Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2014.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company primarily engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian and Southwestern regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. Our objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect:     —  the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures;     —  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital; and     —  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Market Conditions  Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for commodities are inherently volatile. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGL composite price for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:         Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2014        2013        2014        2013       Average NYMEX prices (a)                                                 Natural gas (per mcf)  $  4.67        $  4.09        $  4.79        $  3.73       Oil (per bbl)     102.97           94.20           100.74           94.23       Mont Belvieu NGL Composite (per gallon)     0.81           0.74           0.86           0.76          (a)   Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.  24  Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview of Second Quarter 2014 Results  During second quarter 2014, we achieved the following financial and operating results:      —  increased revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil by 9% from the same period of 2013;      —  achieved 21% production growth over the same period of 2013;      —  continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania by growing production, proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage;      —  reduced direct operating expenses per mcfe by 10% over the same period of 2013;     —  reduced our depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) rate by 8% over the same period of 2013;      —  completed the Conger Exchange on June 16, 2014 and received proceeds of $145.8 million from the sale of non-core assets;     —  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2014, 2015 and 2016;      —  issued 4.56 million shares of common stock as part of a public offering where we received net proceeds of $396.7 million;     —  redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% senior subordinated notes due 2019; and     —  realized $260.3 million of cash flow from operating activities.  Our second quarter 2014 net income was $171.4 million, or $1.04 per diluted common share compared to $144.0 million, or $0.88 per diluted common share in the same period of 2013. During second quarter 2014, we recognized a gain related to the Conger Exchange of $280.1 million compared to a gain on the sale of our New Mexico and certain of our West Texas properties of $79.4 million in the same quarter of 2013. We also experienced an increase in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil driven by 21% higher production volumes. Our second quarter 2014 production growth was due to the continued success of our drilling program, particularly in the Marcellus Shale. Second quarter 2014 production for NGLs increased 111% from the same period of 2013 due to increased sales of ethane based on our new ethane sales/transport agreements which commenced initial deliveries in late 2013. When comparing second quarter 2014 to the same period of 2013, we also reported an unfavorable non-cash fair value adjustment on our commodity derivatives, a non-GAAP measure, along with an unfavorable non-cash mark-to-market adjustment related to our deferred compensation plans and lower realized prices. Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials. The price we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments of delivery location, relative quality and other factors. Average natural gas differentials were $0.60 per mcf below NYMEX in second quarter 2014 compared to $0.04 per mcf above NYMEX in the same quarter of 2013. This decrease was partially offset by realized gains on our basis hedging in second quarter 2014 of $0.02 per mcf. Overview of the First Six Months 2014 Results During the six months ending June 30, 2014, we achieved the following financial and operating results:     —  increased revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil by 26% from the same period of 2013;     —  achieved 21% production growth from the same period of 2013;     —  reduced direct operating expense per mcfe by 3% from the same period of 2013;     —  reduced our DD&A rate by 8% from the same period of 2013;     —  issued 4.56 million shares of common stock as part of a public offering where we received net proceeds of $396.7 million;     —  redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% senior subordinated notes due 2019;     —  completed the Conger Exchange and received proceeds of $146.1 million from the sale of non-core assets;     —  entered into additional firm transportation commitments over the next 25 years along with delivery commitments which begin in 2016;     —  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2014, 2015 and 2016; and     —  realized $441.5 million of cash flow from operating activities. 25  Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $203.9 million or $1.24 per diluted common share compared to $68.4 million or $0.42 per diluted common share in the same period of 2013. In the first six months 2014, we recognized a $280.1 million gain related to the Conger Exchange compared to a gain on the sale of our New Mexico and certain of our West Texas properties of $79.4 million in the same period of 2013. We also experienced increased revenues from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil driven by 21% higher production volumes. When comparing the first six months 2014 to the same period of 2013, we also reported a favorable non-cash mark-to-market adjustment related to our deferred compensation plans and lower general and administrative expenses which were offset by lower realized prices, higher non-cash proved property impairment and an unfavorable non-cash fair value adjustment on our commodity derivatives, a non-GAAP measure. Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials. Average natural gas differentials were equal to NYMEX in the first six months 2014 compared to $0.09 per mcf above NYMEX in the same period of 2013. This increase was more than offset by realized losses on our basis hedging during the first six months 2014 of $0.42 per mcf. We believe natural gas, NGLs and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, worldwide geopolitical events, new technology, the timing of infrastructure build out and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for the remainder of 2014 and for 2015 and 2016, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices that we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future.  Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices, production volumes and the value of certain of our derivative contracts. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Revenues from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales include netback arrangements where we sell natural gas and oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation costs incurred by the purchaser. In this instance, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. Revenues are also realized from sales arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at a specific delivery point and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation cost deductions. Third party transportation costs we incur to get our commodity to the delivery point are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense. Hedges included in natural gas, NGLs and oil sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting. Cash settlements and changes in the market value of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in derivative fair value income or loss in our statements of operations. For more information on revenues from derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges, see the derivative fair value (loss) income discussion below. Effective March 1, 2013, we elected to de-designate all commodity contracts that were previously designated as cash flow hedges and elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.  In second quarter 2014, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 9% compared to the same period of 2013 with a 21% increase in production and a 10% decrease in realized prices. In the six months ended June 30, 2014, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 26% compared to the same period of 2013 with a 21% increase in production and a 4% increase in realized prices. NGLs revenues in second quarter 2014 were negatively impacted by maintenance down time at a third party NGLs processing facility and a weather event which caused a decline in processing ability and efficiency at that same plant. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate sales for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):           Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2014        2013     Change        %        2014        2013        Change     %       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                                                                           Gas wellhead  $  275,726        $  268,069     $  7,657           3  %     $  621,952        $  485,157        $  136,795        28  %    Gas hedges realized (a)     3,626           29,345        (25,719  )        (88  %)        4,794           64,823           (60,029  )     (93  %)    Total gas revenue  $  279,352        $  297,414     $  (18,062  )        (6  %)     $  626,746        $  549,980        $  76,766        14  %    Total NGLs revenue  $   109,998        $  66,587     $  43,411           65  %     $  245,502        $  134,158        $  111,344        83  %    Oil wellhead  $   86,881        $  72,504     $  14,377           20  %     $  175,002        $  149,584        $  25,418        17  %    Oil hedges realized (a)     1,286           1,173        113           10  %        2,284           2,195           89        4  %    Total oil revenue  $   88,167        $  73,677     $  14,490           20  %     $  177,286        $  151,779        $  25,507        17  %    Combined wellhead  $   472,605        $  407,160     $  65,445           16  %        1,042,456           768,899           273,557        36  %    Combined hedges (a)      4,912           30,518        (25,606  )        (84  %)        7,078           67,018           (59,940  )     (89  %)    Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales  $   477,517        $  437,678     $  39,839           9  %     $  1,049,534        $  835,917        $  213,617        26  %       (a)   Cash settlements related to derivatives that qualified or were historically designated for hedge accounting.  26  Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production partially offset by the natural decline of our natural gas and oil wells and asset sales. When compared to the same period of 2013, our second quarter 2014 production volumes increased 25% in our Appalachian region and decreased 3% in our Southwestern region. For the first six months 2014, our production volumes increased 25% in our Appalachian region and decreased 4% in our Southwestern region when compared to the same period of 2013. When compared to the same periods of 2013, our Marcellus production volumes increased 28% for the second quarter and 29% for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Ethane production volumes are reported with NGLs in the table below. Our production for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 is set forth in the following table:           Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2014        2013        Change     %        2014        2013        Change     %       Production (a)                                                                                           Natural gas (mcf)     67,761,616           64,926,278           2,835,338        4  %         129,779,197           126,950,234           2,828,963        2  %    NGLs (bbls)     4,470,854           2,115,489           2,355,365        111  %         8,942,335           4,004,913           4,937,422        123  %    Crude oil (bbls)     989,609           864,517           125,092        14  %         2,024,754           1,777,179           247,575        14  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     100,524,394           82,806,314           17,718,080        21  %         195,581,731           161,642,786           33,938,945        21  %    Average daily production (a)                                                                                         Natural gas (mcf)     744,633           713,476           31,157        4  %         717,012           701,383           15,629        2  %    NGLs (bbls)     49,130           23,247           25,883        111  %         49,405           22,127           27,278        123  %    Crude oil (bbls)     10,875           9,500           1,375        14  %         11,186           9,819           1,367        14  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     1,104,664           909,959           194,705        21  %         1,080,562           893,054           187,508        21  %       (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.      (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not necessarily indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received during second quarter 2014 was $3.73 per mcfe compared to $4.23 per mcfe in the same period of 2013. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received was $3.93 per mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $4.24 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualified for hedge accounting. Average sales prices (wellhead) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying statements of operations. Average sales prices (wellhead) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.

Through February 28, 2013, some of our derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting and were accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value income or loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Effective March 1, 2013, we discontinued hedge accounting prospectively. Since March 1, 2013, all of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment results in volatility of our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues.  Gain on the sale of assets was $282.1 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $83.3 million in the same period of 2013. In second quarter 2014, we recognized a gain related to the Conger Exchange of $280.1 million, after selling expenses. In second quarter 2013, we recognized a gain of $79.4 million, after selling expenses on the sale of our New Mexico and certain of our West Texas properties. Gain on the sale of assets was $281.7 million in the first six months ended June 20, 2014 compared to $83.1 million in the same period of 2013. In addition to the Conger Exchange and the New Mexico sale mentioned above, in the first six months 2014 and 2013, we also sold miscellaneous proved and unproved oil and gas properties and inventory for proceeds received of $1.1 million in first six months 2014 compared to $25.2 million in the same period of 2013 and recognized a gain of $1.6 million in 2014 compared to a gain of $3.8 million in 2013. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in second quarter 2014 was $30.1 million compared to $14.6 million in the same period of 2013. The second quarter 2014 includes a loss from equity method investments of $144,000 and $30.3 million of revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas. The second quarter 2013 includes income from equity method investments of $353,000 and $14.4 million of revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenues in the first six months 2014 was $62.6 million compared to $35.7 million in the same period of 2013. The first six months 2014 includes a loss from equity method investments of $277,000 and $63.5 million of revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas. The first six months ended June 30, 2013 includes income from equity method investments of $273,000 and $35.5 million of revenue from marketing and sale of brokered gas. These revenues are increasing due to an increase in brokered volumes. Effective with the closing of the Conger Exchange, we no longer have income or loss from equity method investments. We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:          Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          (per mcfe)        (per mcfe)          2014        2013        Change     %Change        2014        2013     Change     %Change       Direct operating expense  $  0.35        $  0.39        $  (0.04  )     (10  %)     $  0.38        $  0.39        $  (0.01  )     (3  %)    Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.11           0.13           (0.02  )     (15  %)        0.12           0.14           (0.02  )     (14  %)    General and administrative expense      0.57           1.23           (0.66  )     (54  %)        0.54           1.15           (0.61  )     (53  %)    Interest expense      0.45           0.54           (0.09  )     (17  %)        0.46           0.54           (0.08  )     (15  %)    Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense      1.33           1.45           (0.12  )     (8  %)        1.34           1.45           (0.11  )     (8  %)   Direct operating expense was $34.9 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $32.6 million in the same period of 2013. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and manage existing properties. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Our production volumes increased 21% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for second quarter 2014 only increased 7% with an increase in the number of producing wells, higher water handling and disposal costs and higher stock-based compensation somewhat offset by lower nitrogen blending costs. We incurred $1.9 million of workover costs in second quarter 2014 compared to $2.1 million in the same period of 2013.  28  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in second quarter 2014 decreased 10% from the same period of 2013 with the decrease consisting of lower field services, lower non-recurring well workovers and lower nitrogen blending costs. We expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas.  Direct operating expense was $74.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $62.8 million in the same period of 2013. Our production volumes increased 21%, and on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses increased 19% with an increase in the number of producing wells, higher water handling and disposal costs, higher well services, well workovers, personnel costs and stock-based compensation somewhat offset by the sale of certain non-core assets at the beginning of second quarter 2013. We incurred $7.4 million of workover costs in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $3.5 million in the same period of 2013. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in the six months ended June 30, 2014 decreased 3% to $0.38 from $0.39 the same period of 2013, with the decrease consisting of lower well services somewhat offset by higher workover costs. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of the compensation of field employees. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:          Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          (per mcfe)        (per mcfe)          2014        2013        Change        %Change        2014        2013        Change     %Change       Lease operating expense  $  0.31        $  0.35        $  (0.04  )     (11  %)     $  0.33        $  0.36        $  (0.03  )      (8  %)    Workovers     0.02           0.03           (0.01  )     (33  %)        0.04           0.02           0.02        100  %    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.02           0.01           0.01        100  %        0.01           0.01           ¾        ¾  %    Total direct operating expense  $  0.35        $  0.39        $  (0.04  )     (10  %)     $  0.38        $  0.39        $  (0.01  )     (3  %)   Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee that was initially assessed in 2012. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $4.3 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $4.1 million in the same period of 2013. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $0.04 in second quarter 2014 compared to $0.05 in second quarter 2013 with an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes and lower prices. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” on unconventional natural gas and oil production which includes the Marcellus Shale. Included in second quarter 2014 is a $6.5 million impact fee ($0.07 per mcfe) compared to $7.1 million ($0.09 per mcfe) in the same period of the prior year.  Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) was $9.5 million ($0.05 per mcfe) in the first six months 2014 compared to $8.3 million ($0.05 per mcfe) in the same period of 2013 due to higher prices partially offset by an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes. Included in the first six months 2014 is a $13.0 million ($0.07 per mcfe) impact fee compared to $14.2 million ($0.09 per mcfe) in the same period of 2013. 29  General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $56.9 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $102.0 million for the same period of 2013. The second quarter 2014 decrease of $45.1 million when compared to 2013 is primarily due to lower lawsuit settlements, which were partially offset by higher salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. The second quarter 2013 included an accrual of $52.5 million related to an Oklahoma lawsuit that was settled in second quarter 2013 for $87.5 million. G&A expense for the six months ended June 30, 2014 decreased $79.9 million when compared to the same period of 2013 primarily due to lower lawsuit settlements partially offset by higher salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. Our number of general and administrative employees increased 3% from 2013. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and performance shares granted to our employees and non-employee directors as part of compensation. The second quarter 2014 stock-based compensation increase from the same period of 2013 is primarily due to awards granted to our prior executive chairman for his service in 2013 while he was a Range officer, which were fully vested upon grant. On a per mcfe basis, G&A expense decreased 54% from second quarter 2013 and 53% from the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily due to the settlement of the Oklahoma lawsuit. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:           Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          (per mcfe)        (per mcfe)          2014        2013        Change     %Change        2014        2013        Change     %Change       General and administrative  $  0.36        $  0.44        $  (0.08  )     (18  %)     $  0.37        $  0.46        $  (0.09  )     (20  %)    Oklahoma legal settlement     ¾           0.63           (0.63  )     (100  %)        ¾           0.54           (0.54  )     (100   %)    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.21           0.16           0.05        31  %        0.17           0.15           0.02        13  %    Total general and administrative expense  $   0.57        $  1.23        $  (0.66  )     (54  %)     $  0.54        $  1.15        $  (0.61  )     (53  %)   Interest expense was $45.5 million for second quarter 2014 compared to $45.1 million for second quarter 2013 and was $90.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $87.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2013. The following table presents information about interest expense per mcfe for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:           Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          (per mcfe)        (per mcfe)          2014        2013        Change     %Change        2014        2013        Change     %Change       Bank credit facility  $  0.04        $  0.03        $  0.01        33  %     $  0.04        $  0.05        $  (0.01  )     (20  %)    Subordinated notes     0.38           0.48           (0.10  )     (21  %)        0.39           0.46           (0.07  )     (15  %)    Amortization of deferred financing costs and other     0.03           0.03           ¾        ¾  %        0.03           0.03           ¾        ¾  %    Total interest expense  $  0.45        $  0.54        $  (0.09  )     (17  %)     $  0.46        $  0.54        $  (0.08  )     (15  %)   On an absolute basis, the increase in interest expense for second quarter 2014 from the same period of 2013 was primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt balances partially offset by lower interest rates. In June 2014, we redeemed all of our $300.0 million 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019. In March 2013, we issued $750.0 million of 5.0% senior subordinated notes due 2023. We used the proceeds to partially repay our outstanding bank debt which carries a lower interest rate. The 2013 note issuance was undertaken to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for second quarter 2014 was $657.2 million compared to $163.5 million in the same period of 2013 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.1% in second quarter 2014 compared to 2.2% in the same period of 2013.  On an absolute basis, the increase in interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2014 from the same period of 2013 was primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt balances and higher interest rates. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $634.5 million compared to $424.6 million for 2013 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.1% in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to 2.1% in the same period of 2013. 30  Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) was $133.4 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $120.0 million in the same period of 2013. This increase is due to a 9% decrease in depletion rates more than offset by a 21% increase in production. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $1.26 per mcfe in second quarter 2014 compared to $1.38 per mcfe in the same period of 2013. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to our drilling success in the Marcellus Shale. DD&A was $262.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $235.1 million in the same period of 2013. Depletion expense was $1.27 per mcfe in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $1.38 per mcfe in the same period of 2013. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:        Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          (per mcfe)        (per mcfe)          2014        2013        Change     %Change        2014        2013        Change     %Change       Depletion and amortization  $  1.26        $  1.38        $  (0.12  )     (9  %)     $  1.27        $  1.38        $  (0.11  )     (8  %)    Depreciation     0.03           0.04           (0.01  )     (25  %)        0.03           0.04           (0.01  )     (25  %)    Accretion and other     0.04           0.03           0.01        33  %        0.04           0.03           0.01        33  %    Total DD&A expense  $  1.33        $  1.45        $  (0.12  )     (8  %)     $  1.34        $  1.45        $  (0.11  )     (8  %)   Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, transportation, gathering and compression expense, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties and deferred compensation plan expense. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants, PSUs and SARs grants. The following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation that is allocated to functional expense categories for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):           Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2014        2013        2014        2013       Direct operating expense  $  1,937        $  696        $  2,789        $  1,357       Brokered natural gas and marketing expense     1,130           530           1,658           779       Exploration expense     1,222           960           2,375           2,030       General and administrative expense     20,696           13,263           32,300           23,569       Total  $  24,985        $  15,449        $  39,122        $  27,735      Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $76.8 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $66.0 million in the same period of 2013. Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $151.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $128.5 million in the same period of 2013. These third party costs are higher than 2013 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering, compression and transportation agreements. Second quarter and the first six months ended June 30, 2014 also includes the impact of an ethane transportation contract. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range).  Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $34.8 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $16.7 million in the same period of 2013. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $68.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $39.0 million in the same period of 2013. These costs are higher than 2013 primarily due to an increase in brokered volumes and an increase in salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our marketing staff. The second quarter 2014 also includes transportation capacity charges where we have taken firm transportation capacity ahead of production volumes. 31  Exploration expense was $13.6 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $13.1 million in the same period of 2013 due to higher seismic costs somewhat offset by lower delay rental payments. The six months ended June 30, 2014 includes lower seismic costs and lower delay rental payments when compared to the same period of 2013. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands):           Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2014        2013        Change     %Change        2014        2013        Change     %Change       Seismic  $  6,966        $  6,077        $  889        15  %     $  12,211        $  13,245        $  (1,034  )     (8  %)    Delay rentals and other     1,460           2,052           (592  )     (29  %)        5,554           7,102           (1,548  )     (22  %)    Personnel expense     3,973           3,978           (5  )     ¾  %        8,326           7,629           697        9  %    Stock-based compensation expense     1,222           960           262        27  %        2,375           2,030           345        17  %    Dry hole expense     ¾           1           (1  )     (100  %)        1           (158  )        159        101  %    Total exploration expense  $  13,621        $  13,068        $  553        4  %     $  28,467        $  29,848        $  (1,381  )     (5  %)   Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $9.3 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $19.2 million in the same period of 2013. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $19.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $34.4 million in the same period of 2013. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments will likely be recorded. The decline in second quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2014 when compared to the same periods of 2013 is primarily due to lower than expected forfeiture rates in the Marcellus Shale.  Deferred compensation plan expense was a loss of $10.5 million in second quarter 2014 compared to income of $6.9 million in the same period of 2013. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price increased from $82.97 at March 31, 2014 to $86.95 at June 30, 2014. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price decreased from $81.04 at March 31, 2013 to $77.32 at June 30, 2013. During the six months ended June 30, 2014 deferred compensation expense was $8.5 million compared to $35.5 million in the same period of 2013. Our stock price increased from $84.31 at December 31, 2013 to $86.95 at June 30, 2014. In the same period of 2013, our stock price increased from $62.83 at December 31, 2012 to $77.32 at June 30, 2013. Loss on extinguishment of debt for the second quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $24.6 million. On June 26, 2014, we redeemed our 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019 at 104.0% of par and we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $24.6 million which includes a call premium and the expensing of related deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt. In the second quarter 2013, we redeemed our 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2018 at 103.625% of par and we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $12.3 million which includes a call premium and the expensing of related deferred financing costs. Impairment of proved properties and other assets was $25.0 million in the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2014. Impairment expense was recorded related to certain of our natural gas and oil properties in Mississippi, West Texas and North Texas. Our analysis of these properties determined that undiscounted cash flows were less than their carrying values. These assets were evaluated for impairment due to declining reserve estimates. Impairment of proved properties and other assets for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2013 includes $741,000 impairment expense related to surface acreage in North Texas. Income tax expense was $118.0 million in second quarter 2014 compared to $97.5 million in second quarter 2013. The increase in income taxes in second quarter 2014 reflects a 20% increase in income from operations when compared to the same period of 2013. For the second quarter, the effective tax rate was 40.8% in 2014 compared to 40.4% in 2013. Income tax expense was $136.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to $50.3 million in the same period of 2013. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the increase in income tax expense reflects a 187% increase in income from operations when compared to the prior year. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the effective tax rate was 40.2% compared to 42.4% in the six months ended June 30, 2013. The 2014 and 2013 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, permanent differences and changes in our valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets associated with senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation, which includes distributions from the deferred compensation plan, is expected to exceed the $1.0 million deductible limit provided under section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39% for the remainder of 2014, before any discrete tax items. 32  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and since our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of June 30, 2014, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 164.4 Bcfe for the remainder of 2014, 180.3 Bcfe for 2015 and 34.0 Bcfe for 2016. We have also entered into basis hedges for 215,693 Mmbtu/day through March 2015. Net cash provided from operations in the first six months 2014 was $441.5 million compared to $279.9 million in the same period of 2013. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2013 to 2014 reflects a 21% increase in production and lower lawsuit settlements offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 7%) and higher operating costs. As of June 30, 2014, we have hedged approximately 70% of our projected production for the remainder of 2014, with approximately 81% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first six months 2014 was negative $45.2 million compared to negative $45.1 million for the same period of 2013.  Net cash used in investing activities from operations in first six months 2014 was $512.6 million compared to $328.1 million in the same period of 2013.  During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we:      —  spent $546.4 million on natural gas and oil property additions;      —  spent $110.5 million on acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and      —  received proceeds from asset sales of $146.1 million.  During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we:      —  spent $592.7 million on natural gas and oil property additions;      —  spent $27.4 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale and the Mississippian; and      —  received proceeds from asset sales of $296.1 million.  Net cash provided from financing activities in first six months 2014 was $71.0 million compared to $48.2 million in the same period of 2013. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings.  During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we:      —  borrowed $1.2 billion and repaid $1.2 billion under our bank credit facility, ending the quarter with a $480.0 million outstanding balance on our bank debt;     —  redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019, including related expenses;      —  received proceeds of $396.7 million from the issuance of 4.56 million shares of common stock; and     —  paid dividends of $13.1 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we:      —  borrowed $893.0 million and repaid $1.3 billion under our bank credit facility, ending the quarter with $309.0 million outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility;  33      —  issued $750.0 million principal amount of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2023, at par, with net proceeds of approximately $738.8 million;     —  redeemed all $250.0 million aggregate principal amounts of 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2018 including related expenses;      —  spent $12.3 million related to debt issuance costs; and     —  paid dividends of $13.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first six months 2014, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2014, 2015 and 2016 to protect future cash flows. On April 3, 2014, our borrowing base and our credit facility amounts were reaffirmed.  During first six months 2014, our net cash provided from operating activities of $441.5 million, borrowing under our bank credit facility and an equity offering were used to fund $661.9 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions) and a redemption of our 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019. At June 30, 2014, we had $292,000 in cash and total assets of $7.8 billion.  Long-term debt at June 30, 2014 totaled $2.8 billion, including $480.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility and $2.4 billion of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at June 30, 2014 was $1.1 billion. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A material drop in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year. Our 2014 capital budget is approximately $1.52 billion. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Credit Arrangements  As of June 30, 2014, we maintained a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of February 18, 2016. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders semi-annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors but primarily on the lenders’ assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of two thirds of the lenders; increases to the borrowing base require 97% lender approval. On April 3, 2014, the facility amount on our bank credit facility was reaffirmed at $1.75 billion and our borrowing base was reaffirmed at $2.0 billion. Our current bank group is currently composed of twenty-eight financial institutions.  Our bank debt and our subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt and our subordinated notes). The debt agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. We are in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2014.  34  Cash Dividend Payments  On June 2, 2014, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.6 million) on our common stock, which was paid on June 30, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2014. The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors. Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation and gathering commitments. As of June 30, 2014, we do not have any capital leases. As of June 30, 2014, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of June 30, 2014, we had a total of $131.0 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2013, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $20.0 million decrease in our outstanding bank credit facility balance, the redemption of our 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019 and new firm transportation contracts which increased our contractual obligations by approximately $775.0 million over the next 25 years.  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives, as we typically utilize commodity swap and collar contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our on-going development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. The fair value of these contracts which is represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination is based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax loss of $68.5 million at June 30, 2014. The contracts expire monthly through December 2016. At June 30, 2014, the following commodity-based derivative contracts were outstanding excluding our basis swaps which are discussed separately below:        Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price    Natural Gas                      2014     Collars     447,500 Mmbtu/day     $3.84–$4.48    2015     Collars     145,000 Mmbtu/day     $4.07–$4.56    2014     Swaps     260,000 Mmbtu/day     $4.18    2015     Swaps     287,432 Mmbtu/day     $4.22    2016     Swaps     90,000 Mmbtu/day     $4.21    Crude Oil                      2014     Collars     2,000 bbls/day     $85.55–$100.00    2014     Swaps     9,500 bbls/day     $94.35    2015     Swaps     9,626 bbls/day     $90.57    2016     Swaps     501 bbls/day     $91.10      NGLs (C3-Propane)                      2014     Swaps     12,000 bbls/day     $1.02/gallon    2015     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day     $1.10/gallon      NGLs (NC4-Normal butane)                      2014     Swaps     4,000 bbls/day     $1.34/gallon      NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                      2014     Swaps     3,500 bbls/day     $2.17/gallon    2015     Swaps     500 bbls/day     $2.14/gallon   35  In addition to the collars and swaps discussed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we received for our gas production can be more or less that the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a gain of $8.7 million at June 30, 2014, the volumes are for 215,693 Mmbtu/day and they expire through March 2015. Interest Rates  At June 30, 2014, we had approximately $2.8 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.4 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.5%. Bank debt totaling $480.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 1.9% at June 30, 2014. The 30-day LIBO rate on June 30, 2014 was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on June 30, 2014 would cost us approximately $4.8 million in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2014 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.        ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Natural gas prices affect us more than oil prices because approximately 69% of our December 31, 2013 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2013 to June 30, 2014.  36  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. At June 30, 2014, our derivatives program includes swaps and collars. These contracts expire monthly through December 2016. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of June 30, 2014, approximated a net unrealized pretax loss of $68.5 million. At June 30, 2014, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price     Fair MarketValue                               (in thousands)       Natural Gas                                  2014     Collars     447,500 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.84–$ 4.48     $   (14,561  )    2015     Collars     145,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.07–$ 4.56     $   2,405       2014     Swaps     260,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.18     $   (12,898  )    2015     Swaps     287,432 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.22     $   (190  )    2016     Swaps     90,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.21     $   (1,041  )                                       Crude Oil                                  2014     Collars     2,000 bbls/day     $ 85.55–$ 100.00     $   (1,693  )    2014     Swaps     9,500 bbls/day     $ 94.35     $   (15,149  )    2015     Swaps     9,626 bbls/day     $ 90.57     $   (21,331  )    2016     Swaps     501 bbls/day     $ 91.10     $   (63  )                                       NGLs (C3-Propane)                                  2014     Swaps     12,000 bbls/day     $ 1.02/gallon     $   (4,953  )    2015     Swaps     1,000 bbls/day     $1.10/gallon     $  246                                          NGLs (NC4-Normal butane)                                  2014     Swaps     4,000 bbls/day     $ 1.34/gallon     $   1,108                                          NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                                  2014     Swaps     3,500 bbls/day     $ 2.17/gallon     $   (438  )    2015     Swaps     500 bbls/day     $ 2.14/gallon     $  44      We expect our NGLs production to continue to increase. In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGLs production and we believe NGL prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional markets.  Currently, there is little demand, or facilities to supply the existing demand, for ethane in the Appalachian region. We have previously announced five ethane agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. The Mariner East agreement is expected to begin operations in the second half of 2015. The remaining two contract start dates are still in the planning stage. We cannot assure you that this last facility will become available. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these agreements, we may be required to curtail production or purchase natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas, which will adversely affect our revenues. Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. In addition to the collars and swaps discussed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors. Therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a gain of $8.7 million at June 30, 2014, the volumes are for 215,693 Mmbtu/day and they expire monthly through March 2015. 37  The following table shows the fair value of our collars, swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at June 30, 2014. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments, however such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value                         Increase of        Decrease of             Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%       Collars     $  (13,849  )     $  (48,136  )     $  (131,028  )     $  40,373        $  109,891       Swaps        (54,665  )        (151,201  )        (378,065  )        152,945           383,754       Basis swaps        8,672           948           2,634           (1,171  )        (2,885  )   Our commodity-based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with the majority of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At June 30, 2014, our derivative counterparties include fourteen financial institutions, of which all but two are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts have been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At June 30, 2014, we had $2.8 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.4 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.5%. Bank debt totaling $480.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 1.9% on June 30, 2014. On June 30, 2014, the 30-day LIBO rate was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on June 30, 2014, would cost us approximately $4.8 million in additional annual interest expense.        ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2014 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        38  PART II – OTHER INFORMATION        ITEM 1.
