Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the SEC on February 22, 2017.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and crude oil properties primarily in the Appalachian and North Louisiana regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on a geographical or an area-by-area basis.  Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions and divestitures of non-core assets. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. The price risk on a portion of our production is mitigated using commodity derivative contracts. However, these derivative contracts are limited in duration. Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices continue to be depressed. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect:        •  revenues, profitability and cash flow;        •  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce;         •  the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures; and        •  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Market Conditions Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for these commodities are inherently volatile. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGL composite price for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       Average NYMEX prices (a)                                                                                  Natural gas (per mcf)  $  3.18        $  1.95        $  1.23        63  %     $  3.24     $  2.02     $  1.22     60  %    Oil (per bbl)     48.36           45.31           3.05        7  %        50.09        39.45        10.64     27  %    Mont Belvieu NGLs composite (per gallon) (b)     0.49           0.41           0.08        20  %        0.52        0.37        0.15     41  %       (a)  Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.

Our financial results are significantly impacted by commodity prices. We experienced an increase in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 25% increase in realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by us) and 37% higher production volumes when compared to second quarter 2016. During second quarter 2017, we recognized net income of $69.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted common share compared to net loss of $224.9 million, or $1.35 per diluted common share, during second quarter 2016. One of our primary focuses over the past few years has been to increase efficiencies and reduce costs throughout our organization through a number of internal initiatives. As a result, over the past several years, we have achieved reductions in our direct operating expenses per mcfe when compared to the prior year. The addition of our North Louisiana properties resulted in an increase in direct operating expenses per mcfe in second quarter 2017. We do, however, receive higher net sales prices from these same North Louisiana properties when compared to our other properties. We continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our general and administrative expenses and, in early 2017, implemented additional work force reductions. Overview of First Six Months 2017 Results  During first six months 2017, we achieved the following financial and operating results:         •  38% production growth over the same period of 2016;           •  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil increased 145% from the same period of 2016 with a 79% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and an increase in production volumes;           •  revenue realized from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives increased 66% from the same period of 2016;           •  reduced direct operating expenses per mcfe by 6% from the same period of 2016;           •  reduced general and administrative expense per mcfe 18% from the same period of 2016;           •  reduced interest expense per mcfe 10% from the same period of 2016;           •  reduced our “DD&A” rate per mcfe by 9% from the same period of 2016;            •  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2017, 2018 and 2019; and           •  realized $411.3 million of cash flow from operating activities.    Our financial results are significantly impacted by commodity prices. We experienced an increase in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 33% increase in realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by us) and 38% higher production volumes when compared to first six months 2016. During first six months 2017, we recognized net income of $239.7 million, or $0.97 per diluted common share compared to net loss of $318.7 million, or $1.91 per diluted common share, during first six months 2016.  28  Memorial Merger On September 16, 2016, we completed the MRD Merger. The MRD Merger adds a premier onshore U.S. natural gas resource play to our existing core operating areas. The North Louisiana location provides geographic and marketing diversity to our high quality Appalachia basin assets. We have seen significant improvements in drilling and completion costs by applying best practices from our Marcellus division and capitalizing on synergies. On September 16, 2016, we issued approximately 77.0 million shares of common stock and assumed approximately $1.2 billion in debt in exchange for all outstanding shares of Memorial using an exchange ratio of 0.375 of a share of Range common stock for each share of Memorial common stock. See also Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information. Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Both types of agreements include transportation charges. One type of agreement is a netback agreement, under which we sell natural gas or oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation costs incurred by the purchaser. In this case, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. For our NGLs production, we may receive a net price from the purchaser (which is net of processing costs) which is also recorded as revenue at the net price we receive from the purchaser. Under the other type of agreement, we sell natural gas, NGLs or oil at a specific delivery point, pay transportation and other costs to a third party and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation cost deduction. In that case, we record transportation costs and other costs that we pay to third parties as transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense.  In second quarter 2017, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 125% compared to second quarter 2016 with a 64% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and a 37% increase in average daily production. In the six months ended June 30, 2017, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 145% compared to the same period of 2016 with a 79% increase in average realized prices (before cash settlements on our derivatives) and a 38% increase in production. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, oil and condensate sales for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                                                                  Gas   $  336,534        $  124,187        $  212,347        171  %      $  707,886     $  266,622     $  441,264     166  %    NGLs     123,784           73,456           50,328        69  %         261,847        123,618        138,229     112  %    Oil      45,819           26,963           18,856        70  %         95,854        43,853        52,001     119  %    Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales  $  506,137        $  224,606        $  281,531        125  %     $  1,065,587     $  434,093     $  631,494     145  %   Our production continues to grow through drilling success, additional NGLs extraction and newly acquired production which is partially offset by the natural production decline of our wells and non-core asset sales. Second quarter 2017 production volumes from our newly acquired North Louisiana properties was approximately 416.0 Mmcfe per day. Production volumes from the Marcellus Shale in second quarter 2017 were 1.5 Bcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2016, our Marcellus production volumes increased 9% for second quarter 2017. In first six months 2017, production volumes from our newly acquired North Louisiana properties were 406.3 Mmcfe per day. Production volumes from the Marcellus Shale in first six months 2017 were 1.5 Bcfe per day. When compared to the same period of 2016, our Marcellus production volumes increased 10% for first six months 2017. Our production for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 is set forth in the following table:         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       Production (a)                                                                                  Natural gas (mcf)     119,487,827           82,997,371           36,490,456        44  %        235,744,164        167,864,741        67,879,423     40  %    NGLs (bbls)     8,524,267           6,865,948           1,658,319        24  %        17,060,995        12,840,682        4,220,313     33  %    Crude oil (bbls)     1,052,784           849,538           203,246        24  %        2,118,070        1,693,879        424,191     25  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     176,950,133           129,290,287           47,659,846        37  %        350,818,554        255,072,107        95,746,447     38  %    Average daily production (a)                                                                                   Natural gas (mcf)     1,313,053           912,059           400,994        44  %        1,302,454        922,334        380,120     41  %    NGLs (bbls)     93,673           75,450           18,223        24  %        94,260        70,553        23,707     34  %    Crude oil (bbls)     11,569           9,336           2,233        24  %        11,702        9,307        2,395     26  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     1,944,507           1,420,772           523,735        37  %        1,938,224        1,401,495        536,729     38  %       (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.     (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  29  Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) during second quarter 2017 was $1.80 per mcfe compared to $1.44 per mcfe in second quarter 2016. Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) was $1.98 per mcfe in first six months 2017 compared to $1.49 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Although we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.  Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials. The price we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location, relative quality and other factors. Average natural gas differentials were $0.36 per mcf below NYMEX in second quarter 2017 compared to $0.45 per mcf below NYMEX in second quarter 2016. We also realized losses on our basis hedging in second quarter 2017 of $0.03 per mcf compared to a realized gain of $0.03 per mcf in second quarter 2016. Average natural gas differentials were $0.24 per mcf below NYMEX in first six months 2017 compared to $0.43 per mcf below NYMEX in the same period of the prior year. We also realized gains on basis hedging of $0.04 per mcf in first six months 2017 compared to a gain of $0.04 in the same period of 2016. Average realized price calculations for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are shown below:        Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       Average Prices                                                                                  Average realized prices (excluding derivative settlements):                                                                                  Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.82        $  1.50        $  1.32        88  %     $  3.00     $  1.59     $  1.41     89  %    NGLs (per bbl)     14.52           10.70           3.82        36  %        15.35        9.63        5.72     59  %    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     43.52           31.74           11.78        37  %        45.26        25.89        19.37     75  %    Total (per mcfe) (a)     2.86           1.74           1.12        64  %        3.04        1.70        1.34     79  %    Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements):                                                                                  Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.82        $  2.52        $  0.30        12  %     $  3.04     $  2.60     $  0.44     17  %    NGLs (per bbl)     14.15           11.57           2.58        22  %        14.32        10.94        3.38     31  %    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     48.82           40.48           8.34        21  %        49.16        37.99        11.17     29  %    Total (per mcfe) (a)     2.88           2.50           0.38        15  %        3.04        2.52        0.52     21  %    Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range):                                                                                  Natural gas (per mcf)  $  1.74        $  1.36        $  0.38        28  %     $  1.97     $  1.48     $  0.49     33  %    NGLs (per bbl)     6.88           5.67           1.21        21  %        7.44        5.24        2.20     42  %    Crude oil and condensate (per bbl)     48.82           40.48           8.34        21  %        49.16        37.99        11.17     29  %    Total (per mcfe) (a)     1.80           1.44           0.36        25  %        1.98        1.49        0.49     33  %       (a)  Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  30  Transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense was $191.6 million in second quarter 2017 compared to $136.8 million in second quarter 2016. Transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense was $369.2 million in first six months 2017 compared to $262.1 million in the same period of 2016. These third party costs are higher in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party transportation, gathering, processing and compression agreements. For 2017, these costs also include additional third party costs for our newly acquired North Louisiana production. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range). The following table summarizes transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands) and on a per mcf and per barrel basis:        Three Months EndedJune 30,           Six Months Ended June 30,             2017           2016           Change        %           2017           2016           Change     %       Natural gas   $  129,557        $  96,298        $  33,259        35  %     $  251,750        $  188,890        $  62,860     33  %    NGLs     62,033           40,546           21,487        53  %        117,488           73,217           44,271     60  %    Total  $  191,590        $  136,844        $  54,746        40  %     $  369,238        $  262,107        $  107,131     41  %                                                                                             Natural gas (per mcf)  $  1.08        $  1.16        $  (0.08  )     (7  %)     $  1.07        $  1.13        $  (0.06  )  (5  %)    NGLs (per bbl)  $  7.28        $  5.91        $  1.37        23  %     $  6.89        $  5.70        $  1.19     21  %   Derivative fair value income (loss) was a gain of $111.2 million in second quarter 2017 compared to a loss of $162.8 million in second quarter 2016. Derivative fair value income (loss) was a gain of $276.8 million in first six months 2017 compared to a loss of $75.9 million in the same period of 2016. All of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment can result in more volatility of our revenues as the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions is included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. The following table summarizes the impact of our commodity derivatives for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):           Three Months Ended June 30,           Six Months Ended June 30,          2017           2016           2017           2016       Derivative fair value income (loss) per consolidated statements of operations  $  111,195        $  (162,798  )     $  276,752        $  (75,890  )                                                      Non-cash fair value gain (loss): (1)                                                 Natural gas derivatives  $  73,173        $  (217,534  )     $  172,236        $  (220,480  )    Oil derivatives     12,375           (20,828  )        28,942           (30,335  )    NGLs derivatives     22,268           (22,491  )        76,325           (32,585  )    Freight derivatives     (7  )        (23  )        44           (34  )    Total non-cash fair value gain (loss) (1)  $  107,809        $  (260,876  )     $  277,547        $  (283,434  )                                                      Net cash receipt on derivative settlements:                                                 Natural gas derivatives  $  942        $  84,648        $  8,397        $  170,163       Oil derivatives     5,575           7,427           8,272           20,500       NGL derivatives     (3,131  )        6,003           (17,464  )        16,881       Total net cash receipt (payment)   $  3,386        $  98,078        $  (795  )     $  207,544             (1)  Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives only represent the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. We believe that non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to differentiate non-cash fair market value adjustments from settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under U.S. GAAP, nor should it be considered a substitute for derivative fair value income or loss as reported in our consolidated statements of operations. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in second quarter 2017 was $55.8 million compared to $40.0 million in second quarter 2016 with significantly higher average sales prices and higher sales volumes for our brokered natural gas volumes. Second quarter 2016 includes $5.8 million from the sale of brokered NGLs volumes compared to none in second quarter 2017. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenues in first six months 2017 was $107.4 million compared to $75.0 million in the same period of the prior year due to significantly higher sales prices. In first six months 2016, we also received $8.9 million from the sale of brokered NGLs volumes compared to $728,000 in the same period of 2017. 31  Operating Costs Per mcfe We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:        Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       Direct operating expense  $  0.18        $  0.16        $  0.02        13  %     $  0.17     $  0.18     $  (0.01  )  (6  %)    Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.06           0.05           0.01        20  %         0.05        0.05        —     —  %    General and administrative expense     0.30           0.36           (0.06  )     (17  %)         0.28        0.34        (0.06  )  (18  %)    Interest expense     0.27           0.29           (0.02  )     (7  %)         0.27        0.30        (0.03  )  (10  %)    Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     0.86           0.95           (0.09  )     (9  %)         0.86        0.95        (0.09  )  (9  %)   Direct operating expense was $31.4 million in second quarter 2017 compared to $20.7 million in second quarter 2016. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Our production volumes increased 37% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for second quarter 2017 increased 52% from the prior year quarter. Our direct operating costs increased primarily due to our newly acquired North Louisiana properties partially offset by our continuing cost reduction efforts. We experienced cost increases in many categories of direct operating expenses including personnel costs, well service costs, water handling and disposal costs and workovers. We incurred $1.7 million ($0.01 per mcfe) of workover costs in second quarter 2017 compared to $55,000 in second quarter 2016. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in second quarter 2017 increased 13% from the same period of 2016 with the increase consisting of higher workover and well service costs.  Direct operating expense was $59.4 million in first six months 2017 compared to $44.7 million in the same period of 2016. Our production volumes increased 38%, but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses only increased 33% from the same period of the prior year. Our direct operating costs increased primarily due to our newly acquired North Louisiana properties and higher workover costs partially offset by our continuing cost reduction efforts. We incurred $3.4 million of workover costs in first six months 2017 compared to $1.4 million in the same period of 2016. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in first six months 2017 decreased 6% to $0.17 from $0.18 in the same period of 2016 with the decrease consisting of lower stock-based compensation. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:        Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       Lease operating expense  $  0.17        $  0.15        $  0.02        13  %     $  0.16     $  0.16     $  —     —  %    Workovers     0.01           —           0.01        100  %         0.01        0.01        —     —  %    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     —           0.01           (0.01  )     (100  %)         —        0.01        (0.01  )  (100  %)    Total direct operating expense  $  0.18        $  0.16        $  0.02        13  %      $  0.17     $  0.18     $  (0.01  )  (6  %)   Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $2.3 million in second quarter 2017 compared to $426,000 in second quarter 2016 due to an increase in volumes subject to production and ad valorem taxes due to our newly acquired North Louisiana properties. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $0.02 in second quarter 2017 compared to $0.01 in second quarter 2016. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” which functions as a tax on unconventional natural gas and oil production from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Included in second quarter 2017 is a $7.7 million impact fee ($0.04 per mcfe) compared to $5.6 million ($0.04 per mcfe) in second quarter 2016. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $4.3 million ($0.01 per mcfe) in the first six months 2017 compared to $952,000 ($0.01 per mcfe) in the same period of 2016 due to an increase in volumes subject to production and ad valorem taxes. Included in first six months 2017 is $14.9 million ($0.04 per mcfe) impact fee compared to $11.0 million ($0.04 per mcfe) in the same period of 2016. General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $52.3 million in second quarter 2017 compared to $46.1 million for second quarter 2016. The second quarter 2017 increase of $6.2 million when compared to the same period of 2016 is primarily due to higher salaries and benefits, higher Louisiana franchise taxes and higher office expenses, including technology. At June 30, 2017, the number of G&A employees increased 13% when compared to June 30, 2016 with 10% of the increase resulting from our newly acquired North Louisiana properties. G&A expense for first six months 2017 increased $13.1 million when compared to the same period of the prior year due to higher salaries and benefits, higher Louisiana franchise taxes and higher office expenses. On a per mcfe basis, second quarter 2017 G&A expense decreased 17% from second quarter 2016 and 18% from first six months 2016 primarily due to lower  32  salaries and benefits on a per mcfe basis. The following table summarizes G&A expenses per mcfe for the three months and six months 2017 and 2016:        Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       General and administrative  $  0.22        $  0.24        $  (0.02  )     (8  %)     $  0.21     $  0.24     $  (0.03  )  (13  %)    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.08           0.12           (0.04  )     (33  %)        0.07        0.10        (0.03  )  (30  %)    Total general and administrative expense  $  0.30        $  0.36        $  (0.06  )     (17  %)     $  0.28     $  0.34     $  (0.06  )  (18  %)   Interest expense was $47.9 million for second quarter 2017 compared to $37.8 million for second quarter 2016 and was $95.0 million in first six months 2017 compared to $75.5 million in the same period of 2016. The following table presents information about interest expense per mcfe for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       Bank credit facility  $  0.04        $  0.02        $  0.02        100  %     $  0.04     $  0.02     $  0.02     100  %    Senior notes     0.21           0.07           0.14        200  %        0.21        0.07        0.14     200  %    Subordinated notes     —           0.19           (0.19  )     (100  %)         —        0.19        (0.19  )  (100  %)    Amortization of deferred financing costs and other     0.02           0.01           0.01        100  %        0.02        0.02        —     —  %    Total interest expense  $  0.27        $  0.29        $  (0.02  )     (7  %)      $  0.27     $  0.30     $  (0.03  )  (10  %)      Average debt outstanding (in thousands)  $  3,889,349        $  2,691,758        $  1,197,591        44  %     $  3,871,044     $  2,714,725     $  1,156,319     43  %    Average interest rate (a)     4.7  %        5.3  %        (0.6  %)     (11  %)        4.7  %     5.3  %     (0.6  %)  (11  %)   (a) Includes commitment fees but excludes debt issue costs and amortization of discounts. On an absolute basis, the increase in interest expense for second quarter 2017 from the same period of 2016 was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances partially offset by lower average interest rates. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for second quarter 2017 was $963.5 million compared to $91.7 million in second quarter 2016 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.6% in second quarter 2017 compared to 2.8% in second quarter 2016.  On an absolute basis, the increase in interest expense for first six months 2017 from the same period of 2016 was primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances partially offset by lower average interest rates. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $944.9 million for first six months 2017 compared to $114.7 million for the same period 2016 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.5% in first six months 2017 compared to 2.4% in first six months 2016. Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense was $152.5 million in second quarter 2017 compared to $122.4 million in second quarter 2016. This increase is due to a 37% increase in production volumes somewhat offset by an 8% decrease in depletion rates. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $0.83 per mcfe in second quarter 2017 compared to $0.90 per mcfe in second quarter 2016. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to the mix of our production from our properties with lower depletion rates and asset sales.  33  DD&A expense was $302.3 million in first six months 2017 compared to $243.0 million in the same period of 2016. This increase is due to a 38% increase in production volumes somewhat offset by a 8% decrease in depletion rates. Depletion expense was $0.83 per mcfe in first six months 2017 compared to $0.90 per mcfe in the same period of 2016. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:        Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       Depletion and amortization  $  0.83        $  0.90        $  (0.07  )     (8  %)     $  0.83     $  0.90     $  (0.07  )  (8  %)    Depreciation     0.01           0.02           (0.01  )     (50  %)        0.01        0.02        (0.01  )  (50  %)    Accretion and other     0.02           0.03           (0.01  )     (33  %)        0.02        0.03        (0.01  )  (33  %)    Total DD&A expense  $  0.86        $  0.95        $  (0.09  )     (9  %)      $  0.86     $  0.95     $  (0.09  )  (9  %)   Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, Memorial Merger expenses, termination costs, deferred compensation plan expenses and impairment of proved properties. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants, PSUs and SARs grants. The following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation to functional expense categories for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):         Three Months Ended June 30,        Six Months Ended June 30,          2017        2016        2017     2016       Direct operating expense  $  522        $  696        $  1,046     $  1,284       Brokered natural gas and marketing expense     388           378           651        894       Exploration expense     528           371           1,035        1,061       General and administrative expense     14,279           15,443           25,197        26,556       Termination costs     (46  )        —           1,696        —       Total stock-based compensation  $  15,671        $  16,888        $  29,625     $  29,795      Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $55.9 million in second quarter 2017 compared to $40.9 million in second quarter 2016. The increase reflects significantly higher broker purchase volumes and prices. The second quarter 2016 includes $5.5 million of NGLs volumes purchased compared to none in second quarter 2017. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $109.4 million for first six months 2017 compared to $77.5 million in the same period of 2016. This increase reflects higher brokered purchase prices. The first six months 2016 also includes $8.5 million of purchased NGLs volumes compared to $601,000 in the same period of 2017. Exploration expense was $14.5 million in second quarter 2017 compared to $6.8 million in second quarter 2016 due to higher seismic costs, delay rental costs and personnel costs, primarily due to our newly acquired North Louisiana operations. Exploration expense was $23.0 million in first six months 2017 compared to $11.7 million in the same period of 2016 due to higher seismic costs, delay rental costs and personnel costs, primarily due to our newly acquired North Louisiana operations. The following table details our exploration expenses for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedJune 30,        Six Months EndedJune 30,          2017        2016        Change        %        2017     2016     Change     %       Seismic  $  7,089        $  1,030        $  6,059        588  %     $  8,953     $  1,181     $  7,772     658  %    Delay rentals and other     3,917           2,803           1,114        40  %         6,738        4,628        2,110     46  %    Personnel expense     2,964           2,581           383        15  %         6,276        4,828        1,448     30  %    Stock-based compensation expense     528           371           157        42  %         1,035        1,061        (26  )  (2  %)    Total exploration expense  $  14,498        $  6,785        $  7,713        114  %     $  23,002     $  11,698     $  11,304     97  %   Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $5.2 million in second quarter 2017 compared to $7.1 million in second quarter 2016. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $9.6 million in first six months 2017 compared to $17.7 million in the same period of 2016. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis  34  and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.  MRD Merger expenses of $2.6 million in second quarter 2016 represents amounts paid through June 30, 2016 in connection with the MRD Merger, which includes consulting, investment banking, advisory, legal and other merger-related fees. There were no MRD Merger expenses in first six months 2017. Termination costs were a reduction of $96,000 for second quarter 2017 compared to an increase of $5,000 in the same period of 2016. In first quarter 2017, we implemented additional work force reductions which increased these costs $2.4 million for estimated severance costs and $1.7 million of accelerated vesting of equity grants. Termination costs were $4.1 million in first six months 2017 compared to $167,000 in the same period of the prior year. In 2016, these costs represent additional building lease costs related to the closing of our Oklahoma City office. Deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of $14.5 million in second quarter 2017 compared to a loss of $25.7 million in second quarter 2016. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price decreased from $29.10 at March 31, 2017 to $23.17 at June 30, 2017. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price increased from $32.38 at March 31, 2016 to $43.14 at June 30, 2016. During first six months ended 2017, deferred compensation was a gain of $27.6 million compared to a loss of $41.8 million in the same period of 2016. Our stock price decreased from $34.36 at December 31, 2016 to $23.17 at June 30, 2017. In the same period of 2016, our stock price increased from $24.61 at December 31, 2015 to $43.14 at June 30, 2016. Impairment of proved properties was $43.0 million in first six months 2016. There was no impairment of proved properties in first six months 2017. We assess our proved natural gas and oil properties whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The cash flows we use to assess proved property impairment includes numerous assumptions including (1) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves (2) results of future drilling activities (3) future commodity prices and (4) increases or decreases in production and capital costs. All inputs are evaluated at each measurement date. In first quarter 2016, impairment expense was recorded related to certain of our oil and gas properties in Oklahoma. Due to falling commodity prices, our analysis of these properties, which included the possibility of a sale of certain of these properties, determined that undiscounted future cash flows were less than their carrying values.  (Gain) loss on the sale of assets was a gain of $807,000 in second quarter 2017 compared to a loss of $3.3 million in second quarter 2016. (Gain) loss on sale of assets was a gain of $23.4 million in first six months 2017 compared to a loss of $4.9 million in the same period of 2016. In first six months 2017, we sold properties in Western Oklahoma for $26.0 million of proceeds and, after closing adjustments, we recognized a gain of $22.1 million related to this sale. In first quarter 2016, we sold our non-operated interest in certain wells and gathering facilities in Northeast Pennsylvania for proceeds of $111.5 million and, after closing adjustments, we recognized a loss of $2.1 million related to this sale. In second quarter 2016, we sold certain properties in Western Oklahoma for proceeds of $77.7 million, after closing adjustments, and recorded a $2.7 million loss related to this sale. 35  Income tax expense (benefit) was an expense of $57.7 million in second quarter 2017 compared to a benefit of $129.5 million in second quarter 2016. For the second quarter 2017, the effective tax rate was 45.3% compared to 36.5% in 2016. Income tax expense was $170.0 million in first six months 2017 compared to a benefit of $171.5 million in the same period of 2016. For first six months 2017, the effective tax rate was 41.5% compared to 35.0% in first six months 2016. The 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and other discrete tax items which are detailed below. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40% for the remainder of 2017, before any discreet tax items (dollars in thousands).

Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and because our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year-to-year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. As of June 30, 2017, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 263.2 Bcfe for the remainder of 2017, 197.8 Bcfe for 2018 and 1.1 Bcfe in 2019, not including our basis swaps. 36  The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands):                   Six Months Ended June 30,             2017           2016       Sources of cash and cash equivalents                         Operating activities  $  411,328        $  173,201       Disposal of assets     27,288           190,803       Borrowing on credit facility     946,000           647,000       Other     36,343           33,310       Total sources of cash and cash equivalents  $  1,420,959        $  1,044,314                                 Uses of cash and cash equivalents                         Additions to natural gas and oil properties  $  (469,644  )     $  (241,109  )    Repayment on credit facility     (874,000  )        (739,000  )    Repayment of senior notes     (500  )        —       Acreage purchases     (37,987  )        (23,554  )    Other property     (2,966  )        (1,304  )    Dividends paid     (9,914  )        (6,796  )    Other     (25,742  )        (32,640  )    Total uses of cash and cash equivalents  $  (1,420,753  )     $  (1,044,403  )   Net cash provided from operating activities in first six months 2017 was $411.3 million compared to $173.2 million in first six months 2016. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2016 to 2017 reflects a 38% increase in production and higher net realized prices (an increase of 33%) somewhat offset by higher operating costs. As of June 30, 2017, we have hedged more than 65% of our projected total production for the remainder of 2017, with more than 75% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first six months 2017 were negative $14.3 million compared to negative $4.3 million for first six months 2016.  Disposal of assets in first six months 2017 includes $26.0 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain Western Oklahoma properties which closed in February 2017. First six months 2016 includes $111.5 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain of our properties in Northeast Pennsylvania which closed in March 2016 and $77.7 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain properties in Western Oklahoma. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first six months 2017, we continued to reduce our operating costs per unit of production and we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2017, 2018 and 2019 to protect future cash flows. In March 2017, our borrowing base and credit facility commitment were reaffirmed through May 1, 2018. 37  During first six months 2017, our net cash provided from operating activities of $411.3 million, proceeds we received from asset sales and borrowings under our bank credit facility were used to fund approximately $510.6 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At June 30, 2017, we had $520,000 in cash and total assets of $11.6 billion.  Long-term debt at June 30, 2017 totaled $3.8 billion, including $954.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility, $2.9 billion of senior notes and $49.0 million of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at June 30, 2017 was $760.3 million. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A further material decline in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and operate profitably. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year, taking into account various factors including the commodity price environment. Our 2017 capital budget is $1.15 billion. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Credit Arrangements  As of June 30, 2017, we maintained a revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of $2.0 billion, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility, during a non-investment grade period, is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of October 16, 2019. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. Availability under the bank credit facility, during an investment grade period, is limited to aggregate lender commitments. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding balance under our credit facility was $954.0 million. Additionally, we had $285.7 million of undrawn letters of credit leaving $760.3 million of committed borrowing capacity available under the facility at the end of second quarter 2017.  Our bank credit facility imposes limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under our bank credit facility). These agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, investments and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at June 30, 2017. See Note 9 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our bank debt. Cash Dividend Payments  In February 2016, the Board of Directors approved a reduction of our quarterly dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.02 per share. On June 1, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of two cents per share ($5.0 million) on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on June 30, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2017. The amount of future dividends is subject to discretionary declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors.  Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation, processing and gathering commitments. As of June 30, 2017, we do not have any capital leases. As of June 30, 2017, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of June 30, 2017, we had a total of $285.7 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2016, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $72.0 million increase in our outstanding bank credit facility balance and an extension of terms related to existing processing and gathering contracts. Our contractual obligations for firm transportation and gathering contracts increased by approximately $420.0 million over the next twenty-two years related to this extension.  38  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We utilize commodity swap and option contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. The fair value of these contracts which is represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination is based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX for natural gas and oil or Mont Belvieu for NGLs, approximated a pretax gain of $99.8 million at June 30, 2017. The contracts expire monthly through December 2019. At June 30, 2017, the following commodity-based derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed separately below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price                           Natural Gas                      2017     Swaps (1)     865,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.21    2018     Swaps     417,260 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.25    2017     Collars (1)     122,609 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.45–$ 4.11    2018     Collars     60,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.40–$ 3.76    2017     Purchased Puts (1)     185,870 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.50 (2)    2017     Sold Calls     23,370 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.70 (3)                           Crude Oil                      2017     Swaps (1)     8,761 bbls/day     $ 56.38    2018     Swaps     5,250 bbls/day     $ 53.20    2019     Swaps     500 bbls/day     $ 51.75                           NGLs (C2-Ethane)                      2017     Swaps     3,000 bbls/day     $ 0.27/gallon    2018     Swaps     250 bbls/day     $ 0.29/gallon                             NGLs (C3-Propane)                      2017     Swaps     13,826 bbls/day     $ 0.57/gallon    2018     Swaps     7,199 bbls/day     $ 0.65/gallon                             NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                      2017     Swaps     7,875 bbls/day     $ 0.75/gallon    2018     Swaps     4,250 bbls/day     $ 0.81/gallon      NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                      2017     Swaps     5,500 bbls/day     $ 1.07/gallon    2018     Swaps     1,500 bbls/day     $ 1.19/gallon   (1) Includes derivative instruments assumed in connection with the MRD Merger. (2) Weighted average deferred premium is ($0.32). (3) Weighted average deferred premium is $0.27. In addition to the swaps discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we received for our natural gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a loss of $10.5 million at June 30, 2017. The volumes are for 71,212,500 Mmbtu and they expire monthly through October 2018. At June 30, 2017, we also had propane spread swap contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. These contracts settle monthly through December 2018 and include total volume of 910,500 barrels in 2017 and 750,000 barrels in 2018. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $2.6 million on June 30, 2017. 39  Interest Rates  At June 30, 2017, we had approximately $3.8 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $954.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 2.7% at June 30, 2017. The 30-day LIBOR Rate on June 30, 2017 was approximately 1.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on June 30, 2017 would cost us approximately $9.5 million in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any significant off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments, some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2017 to continue to be a function of supply.    ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Changes in natural gas prices affect us more than changes in oil prices because approximately 65% of our December 31, 2016 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017.  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program can also include collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. At June 30, 2017, our derivative program includes swaps, collars and options. These contracts expire monthly through December 2019. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of June 30, 2017, approximated a net unrealized pretax gain of $99.8 million. At June 30, 2017, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed below:    40      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price     Fair MarketValue                               (in thousands)       Natural Gas                                  2017     Swaps (1)     865,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.21     $  17,608       2018     Swaps     417,260 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.25     $  15,287       2017     Collars (1)     122,609 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.45–$ 4.11     $  9,615       2018     Collars     60,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.40–$ 3.76     $  1,014       2017     Purchased Puts (1)     185,870 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.50 (2)     $  17,314       2017     Sold Calls     23,370 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.70 (3)     $  (133  )                                       Crude Oil                                  2017     Swaps (1)     8,761 bbls/day     $ 56.38     $  15,465       2018     Swaps     5,250 bbls/day     $ 53.20     $  9,237       2019     Swaps     500 bbls/day     $ 51.75     $  391                                          NGLs (C2-Ethane)                                  2017     Swaps     3,000 bbls/day     $ 0.27/gallon     $  405       2018     Swaps     250 bbls/day     $ 0.29/gallon     $  40                                          NGLs (C3-Propane)                                  2017     Swaps     13,826 bbls/day     $ 0.57/gallon     $  (5,553  )    2018     Swaps     7,199 bbls/day     $ 0.65/gallon     $  5,871                                          NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                                  2017     Swaps     7,875 bbls/day     $ 0.75/gallon     $  232       2018     Swaps     4,250 bbls/day     $ 0.81/gallon     $  8,164                                          NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                                  2017     Swaps     5,500 bbls/day     $ 1.07/gallon     $  1,602       2018     Swaps     1,500 bbls/day     $ 1.19/gallon     $  3,248      (1) Includes derivative instruments assumed in connection with the MRD Merger. (2) Weighted average deferred premium is ($0.32). (3) Weighted average deferred premium is $0.27. In the future, we expect our NGLs production to continue to increase. We believe NGLs prices are somewhat seasonal, particularly for propane. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional and international markets. If we are not able to sell or store NGLs, we may be required to curtail production or shift our drilling activities to dry gas areas. Currently, the Appalachian region has limited local demand and infrastructure to accommodate ethane. We have previously announced three ethane agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. Our Mariner East transportation agreement and our terminal/storage arrangements at Sunoco’s Marcus Hook Industrial Complex facility near Philadelphia began ethane operations in early 2016. We cannot assure you that these facilities will remain available. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these agreements, we may be required to curtail production or, as we have in the past, purchase or divert natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. Therefore, in addition to the swaps discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of basis adjustments, relative quality and other factors. Basis swap agreements effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the natural gas basis swaps was a loss of $10.5 million at June 30, 2017 and they settle monthly through October 2018. At June 30, 2017, we also had propane basis spread contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. The contracts settle monthly through December 2018 and include a total volume of 910,500 barrels in 2017 and 750,000 barrels in 2018. The fair value of these contracts was a gain of $2.6 million on June 30, 2017. 41  The following table shows the fair value of our swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical changes in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at June 30, 2017. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                       Hypothetical Changein Fair Value        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value                         Increase of        Decrease of             Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%       Swaps     $  71,998        $  (134,243  )     $  (334,187  )     $  135,268        $  338,212       Collars        10,629           (5,894  )        (14,098  )        6,580           17,472       Puts        17,314           (5,510  )        (10,817  )        6,985           19,223       Calls        (134  )        (193  )        (751  )        82           124       Basis swaps        (7,928  )        2,161           5,362           (2,142  )        (5,405  )    Freight swap        109           214           538           (218  )        (547  )   Our commodity-based derivative contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified primarily among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At June 30, 2017, our derivative counterparties include twenty-two financial institutions, of which all but five are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are primarily major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial. Our propane sales from the Marcus Hook facility near Philadelphia are short-term and are to a single purchaser. Ethane sales from Marcus Hook are to a single international customer bearing a credit rating similar to Range. Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior and senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At June 30, 2017, we had $3.8 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.7 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $954.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 2.7% on June 30, 2017. On June 30, 2017, the 30-day LIBOR Rate was approximately 1.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on June 30, 2017, would cost us approximately $9.5 million in additional annual interest expense.      ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2017 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  42  PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 16 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part I Item 1 above for a summary of our legal proceedings, such information being incorporated herein by reference.  Environmental Proceedings Our subsidiary, Range Resources – Appalachia, LLC, was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”), in second quarter 2015, that it intends to assess a civil penalty under the Clean Streams Law and the 2012 Oil and Gas Act in connection with one well in Lycoming County. The DEP has directed us to prevent methane and other substances from escaping from this gas well into groundwater and a stream. We have considerable evidence that this well is not leaking and pre-drill testing of surrounding water wells showed the presence of methane in the water before commencement of our operations. While we intend to vigorously assert this position with the DEP, resolution of this matter may nonetheless result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.     ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.
