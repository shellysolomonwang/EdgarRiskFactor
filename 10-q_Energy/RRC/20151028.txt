Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as filed with the SEC on February 24, 2015.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company primarily engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian and Midcontinent regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. Prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil fluctuate widely and affect:        ●  the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures;        ●  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital;         ●  the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce; and        ●  revenues and profitability. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Market Conditions Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for commodities are inherently volatile and have decreased significantly over the past year. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil and the Mont Belvieu NGL composite price for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:            Three Months EndedSeptember 30,           Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2015           2014           2015           2014       Average NYMEX prices (a)                                                 Natural gas (per mcf)  $  2.76        $  4.05        $  2.79        $  4.52       Oil (per bbl)     46.61           96.99           51.18           99.51       Mont Belvieu NGLs composite (per gallon) (b)     0.37           0.76           0.40           0.83             (a)  Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.         (b)  Based on our estimated NGLs product component per barrel. North American and worldwide natural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices remain under pressure given the current oversupply of these commodities. In general, this imbalance between supply and demand reflects the significant supply growth achieved in the United States as a result of shale drilling and the recent OPEC oil production increases combined with only modest demand growth in the United States and slowing demand in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe and China. Although there has been a  23  dramatic decrease in drilling activity in the industry, crude oil and NGLs storage levels in the United States remain at historically high levels. Until the overhang in natural gas supply and liquids storage levels begins to decline, prices are expected to remain under pressure. The reduced demand for drilling rigs, oilfield supplies, drill pipe and services, for which prices had reached very high levels during a period of high utilization in 2014, has led to a decline of these costs. However, their declines have significantly lagged behind the declines in oil, NGLs and natural gas prices. As a result of these circumstances, we have experienced significant operating margin deterioration during 2015. One of our primary focuses in 2015 has been to reduce costs throughout the organization, through a number of internal initiatives. For example, we closed our Oklahoma City administrative and operational office to reduce our general and administrative expenses. In addition, we have also made personnel reductions in legacy Pennsylvania operating areas to reduce lease operating expenses. We also continue to improve drilling and completion efficiencies and have reduced capital spending from the prior year which, along with lower operating costs and general and administrative expenses, is expected to minimize our spending in excess of cash flows for 2015. Our goal is to continue to reduce costs on a per mcfe basis where possible. We assess our proved natural gas and oil properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. In third quarter 2015, impairment expense of $502.2 million was recorded related to certain of our natural gas and oil properties in Northern Oklahoma and legacy producing assets in Northwest Pennsylvania. Due to falling commodity prices, our analysis of these properties determined that the undiscounted cash flows were less than their carrying values. We believe natural gas, NGLs and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, worldwide geopolitical events, new technology, the timing of infrastructure build out and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for the remainder of 2015 and for 2016 and 2017, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unhedged volumes and reduce the prices for which we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future.  Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview of Third Quarter 2015 Results  During third quarter 2015, we experienced the following financial and operating results:         ●  20% production growth over the same period of 2014;        ●  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil decreased 43% from the same period of 2014 with a 36% decline in average sales prices somewhat offset by our increase in production volumes;        ●  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives declined 16% from the same period of 2014;        ●  continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania by growing production, proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage;         ●  reduced direct operating expenses per mcfe by 24% from the same period of 2014;        ●  reduced our depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) rate per mcfe by 9% from the same period of 2014;         ●  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2015, 2016 and 2017; and        ●  realized $145.4 million of cash flow from operating activities. Our financial results have been significantly impacted by lower commodity prices. We experienced a decrease in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 36% decrease in realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by us) partially offset by 20% higher production volumes when compared to third quarter 2014. Our third quarter 2015 production growth was due to the continued success of our drilling program in the Marcellus Shale. During third quarter 2015, we recognized a net loss of $300.9 million, or $1.81 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $146.4 million, or $0.86 per diluted common share, during third quarter 2014. When comparing third quarter 2015 to third quarter 2014, in addition to lower realized prices, we also reported a $502.2 million proved property impairment due to the declines in commodity prices, a lower non-cash fair value gain on our commodity derivatives (a non-GAAP measure) and a loss on extinguishment of debt.  Overview of the First Nine Months 2015 Results During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we experienced the following financial and operating results:        ●  23% production growth from the same period of 2014; 24         ●  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil decreased 44% from the same period of 2014 with a 35% decline in average sale prices somewhat offset by our increase in production volumes;        ●  revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil including cash settlements on our derivatives declined 13% from the same period of 2014;        ●  reduced direct operating expense per mcfe by 24% from the same period of 2014;        ●  reduced our DD&A rate by 9% from the same period of 2014;        ●  issued $750.0 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2025;        ●  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2015, 2016 and 2017; and        ●  realized $515.6 million of cash flow from operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recognized a net loss of $391.9 million, or $2.36 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $350.3 million or $2.10 per diluted common share in the same period of 2014. In the first nine months 2015, we experienced a decrease in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to a 35% decrease in realized prices partially offset by 23% higher production volumes. When comparing the first nine months 2015 to the same period of 2014, in addition to lower realized prices, we also reported higher impairment of proved properties, an unfavorable non-cash fair value adjustment on our commodity derivatives (a non-GAAP measure), lower gains on asset sales, additional termination costs and unfavorable brokered gas and marketing margins which included higher operating costs on our company-owned gathering lines. These decreases were partially offset by a favorable non-cash mark-to-market adjustment related to our deferred compensation plan.  Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Revenues from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales include netback arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation costs incurred by the purchaser. In this instance, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. Revenues are also realized from sales arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at a specific delivery point and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation cost deductions. Third party transportation costs we incur to move our commodity to the delivery point are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense. Cash settlements and changes in the market value of derivative contracts are included in derivative fair value income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Effective March 1, 2013, we elected to de-designate all commodity contracts that were previously designated as cash flow hedges and elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.  25  In third quarter 2015, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales decreased 43% compared to third quarter 2014 with a 53% decrease in average realized prices partially offset by a 20% increase in production. In the nine months ended September 30, 2015, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales decreased 44% compared to the same period in 2014 with a 55% decrease in average realized prices partially offset by a 23% increase in production. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, oil and condensate sales for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change        %       Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales                                                                                     Gas   $  189,113        $  252,562        $  (63,449  )     (25  %)     $  589,517     $  874,514     $  (284,997  )     (33  %)    Gas hedges realized (a)     ¾           1,966           (1,966  )     (100  %)        ¾        6,760        (6,760  )     (100  %)    Total gas revenue  $  189,113        $  254,528        $  (65,415  )     (26  %)     $  589,517     $  881,274     $  (291,757  )     (33  %)    Total NGLs revenue  $  31,066        $  109,858        $  (78,792  )     (72  %)     $  131,822     $  355,360     $  (223,538  )     (63  %)    Oil   $  31,886        $  80,144        $  (48,258  )     (60  %)     $  114,262     $  255,146     $  (140,884  )     (55  %)    Oil hedges realized (a)     ¾           1,537           (1,537  )     (100  %)        ¾        3,821        (3,821  )     (100  %)    Total oil revenue  $  31,886        $  81,681        $  (49,795  )     (61  %)     $  114,262     $  258,967     $  (144,705  )     (56  %)    Combined   $  252,065        $  442,564        $  (190,499  )     (43  %)        835,601        1,485,020        (646,419  )     (44  %)    Combined hedges (a)      ¾           3,503           (3,503  )     (100  %)        ¾        10,581        (10,581  )     (100  %)    Total natural gas,  NGLs and oil sales  $  252,065        $  446,067        $  (194,002  )     (43  %)     $  835,601     $  1,495,601     $  (660,000  )     (44  %)       (a)   Cash settlements related to derivatives that qualified or were historically designated for hedge accounting. In early 2013, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting. Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production but is partially offset by the natural production decline of our natural gas and oil wells and asset sales. When compared to the same period of 2014, our third quarter 2015 production volumes increased 24% in our Appalachian region and decreased 35% in our Midcontinent region. Our Midcontinent production volumes were negatively impacted by the sale of certain West Texas properties which closed in February 2015. For the first nine months 2015, our production volumes increased 29% in our Appalachian region and decreased 36% in our Midcontinent region when compared to the same period of 2014. Our Midcontinent production volumes were negatively impacted by the Conger Exchange transaction which closed in June 2014 and the sale of certain other West Texas properties which closed in February 2015. When compared to the same periods of 2014, our Marcellus production volumes increased 28% for third quarter 2015 and increased 30% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Production volumes from the Marcellus Shale in third quarter 2015 were 115.6 Bcfe. Our production for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 is set forth in the following table:         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Production (a)                                                                                  Natural gas (mcf)     97,273,739           75,665,182           21,608,557        29  %         265,511,105        205,444,379        60,066,726     29  %    NGLs (bbls)     4,985,092           4,934,882           50,210        1  %         15,449,495        13,877,217        1,572,278     11  %    Crude oil (bbls)     958,628           985,300           (26,672  )     (3  %)         3,187,005        3,010,054        176,951     6  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     132,936,059           111,186,274           21,749,785        20  %         377,330,105        306,768,005        70,562,100     23  %    Average daily production (a)                                                                                Natural gas (mcf)     1,057,323           822,448           234,875        29  %         972,568        752,544        220,024     29  %    NGLs (bbls)     54,186           53,640           546        1  %         56,592        50,832        5,760     11  %    Crude oil (bbls)     10,420           10,710           (290  )     (3  %)         11,674        11,026        648     6  %    Total (mcfe) (b)     1,444,957           1,208,546           236,411        20  %         1,382,162        1,123,692        258,470     23  %       (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.      (b)   Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) during third quarter 2015 was $2.18 per mcfe compared to $3.40 per mcfe in third quarter 2014. Our average realized price received (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) was $2.42 per mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $3.74 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Although we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation  26  also includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualified for hedge accounting. Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements) do not include derivative settlements or third party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds from purchasers.  Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials. The price we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments of delivery location, relative quality and other factors. Average natural gas differentials were $0.82 per mcf below NYMEX in third quarter 2015 compared to $0.71 per mcf below NYMEX in third quarter 2014. We also realized gains on our basis hedging in third quarter 2015 of $0.04 per mcf compared to a realized gain of $0.22 per mcf in third quarter 2014. Average natural gas differentials were $0.57 per mcf below NYMEX in the first nine months 2015 compared to $0.26 per mcf below NYMEX in the same period of 2014 which was due, in part, to extreme cold weather conditions in first quarter 2014. We also realized losses on our basis hedging of $0.01 per mcf in the first nine months 2015 compared to a loss of $0.19 per mcf in the first nine months 2014.

Derivative fair value income (loss) was income of $202.0 million in third quarter 2015 compared to $142.1 million in third quarter 2014. Derivative fair value income (loss) was income of $290.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to loss of $28.9 million in the same period of 2014. Through February 28, 2013, some of our derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting and were accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions and derivative settlements not accounted for as hedges were included in derivative fair value income or loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Effective March 1, 2013, we discontinued hedge accounting prospectively. Since March 1, 2013, all of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment results in volatility of our revenues as the change in the fair value of our commodity derivative positions is included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. The following table summarizes the impact of our commodity derivatives for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):  27              Three Months Ended September 30,           Nine Months Ended September 30,          2015           2014           2015           2014       Derivative fair value income (loss) per consolidated statements of operations  $  202,004        $  142,057        $  290,052        $  (28,902  )                                                      Non-cash fair value gain (loss): (1)                                                 Natural gas derivatives  $  38,604        $  61,228        $  (26,380  )     $  42,317       Oil derivatives     5,822           55,393           (60,798  )        20,981       NGLs derivatives     19,649           8,533           16,585           21,659       Total non-cash fair value gain (loss) (1)  $  64,075        $  125,154        $  (70,593  )     $  84,957                                                         Net cash receipt (payment) on derivative settlements:                                                 Natural gas derivatives  $  80,675        $  19,762        $  223,603        $  (83,983  )    Oil derivatives     41,207           (4,182  )        105,434           (16,762  )    NGLs derivatives     16,047           1,323           31,608           (13,114  )    Total net cash receipt (payment)  $  137,929        $  16,903        $  360,645        $  (113,859  )          (1)  Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a non-GAAP measure. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives only represent the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. We believe that non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to differentiate non-cash fair market value adjustments from settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered a substitute for derivative fair value income or loss as reported in our consolidated statements of operations. (Loss) gain on the sale of assets was a loss of $681,000 in third quarter 2015 compared to a gain of $167,000 in third quarter 2014. In third quarter 2015, we sold miscellaneous surface acreage and inventory for proceeds of $524,000 and recognized a pre-tax loss of $681,000. Gain on the sale of assets was $2.1 million in the first nine months 2015 compared to a $281.9 million gain in the same period of 2014. The first nine months 2015 includes the sale of miscellaneous unproved and proved properties, surface acreage and inventory for cash proceeds of $14.8 million. Included in the $14.8 million of proceeds is $10.5 million received from the sale of certain West Texas properties. In the first nine months 2014, we recognized a gain related to the Conger Exchange of $280.1 million, after selling expenses. In the first nine months 2014, in addition to the Conger Exchange, we sold miscellaneous proved and unproved oil and gas properties for proceeds of $2.1 million and recognized a gain of $1.7 million. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in third quarter 2015 was $25.9 million compared to $28.3 million in third quarter 2014 with higher brokered volumes offset by significantly lower average sales prices. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenues in the first nine months 2015 was $61.7 million compared to $90.9 million in the same period of 2014 with higher brokered volumes offset by significantly lower average sales prices. The three months ended September 30, 2014 included revenue of $6.8 million from the sale of excess transportation capacity and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included revenue of $9.5 million from the sale of excess transportation capacity compared to none in either the three months or the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Operating Costs per mcfe. We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Direct operating expense  $  0.26        $  0.34        $  (0.08  )     (24  %)     $  0.28     $  0.37     $  (0.09  )  (24  %)    Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.06           0.09           (0.03  )     (33  %)         0.07        0.11        (0.04  )  (36  %)    General and administrative expense     0.35           0.49           (0.14  )     (29  %)         0.40        0.53        (0.13  )  (25  %)    Interest expense     0.32           0.35           (0.03  )     (9  %)         0.33        0.42        (0.09  )  (21  %)    Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     1.16           1.28           (0.12  )     (9  %)         1.20        1.32        (0.12  )  (9  %)   Direct operating expense was $35.1 million in third quarter 2015 compared to $37.8 million in third quarter 2014. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Our production volumes increased 20% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for third quarter 2015 declined 7% from the prior year quarter, with an increase in the number of producing wells, higher water handling  28  and disposal costs and higher workover costs more than offset by lower well service costs, lower personnel and stock-based compensation costs. We incurred $2.6 million of workover costs in third quarter 2015 compared to $1.3 million in third quarter 2014.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in third quarter 2015 decreased 24% from the same period of 2014 with the decrease consisting of lower well service costs, lower personnel and stock-based compensation partially offset by higher water handling and disposal costs and higher non-recurring well workovers. We expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas. Direct operating expense was $107.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $112.5 million in the same period of 2014. Our production volumes increased 23% but, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses decreased 5% with an increase in the number of producing wells and higher water handling and disposal costs more than offset by lower workover costs, lower well service costs, lower field personnel and stock-based compensation costs and the sale of certain non-core assets in second quarter 2014. We incurred $5.1 million of workover costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $8.7 million in the same period of 2014.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 decreased 24% to $0.28 from $0.37 in the same period of 2014, with the decrease consisting of lower well service costs, lower field personnel costs and lower workover costs somewhat offset by higher water handling and disposal costs. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants as part of the compensation of our field employees.  The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Lease operating expense  $  0.24        $  0.32        $  (0.08  )     (25  %)     $  0.26     $  0.33     $  (0.07  )  (21  %)    Workovers     0.02           0.01           0.01        100  %         0.01        0.03        (0.02  )  (67  %)    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     ¾           0.01           (0.01  )     (100  %)         0.01        0.01        ¾     ¾  %    Total direct operating expense  $  0.26        $  0.34        $  (0.08  )     (24  %)      $  0.28     $  0.37     $  (0.09  )  (24  %)   Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $1.8 million in third quarter 2015 compared to $3.6 million in third quarter 2014. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $0.02 in third quarter 2015 compared to $0.03 in third quarter 2014 due to an increase in volumes not subject to production or ad valorem taxes and lower prices. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” which functions as a tax on unconventional natural gas and oil production from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Included in third quarter 2015 is a $5.5 million impact fee ($0.04 per mcfe) compared to $6.5 million ($0.06 per mcfe) in third quarter 2014.  Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $8.4 million ($0.02 per mcfe) in the first nine months 2015 compared to $13.1 million ($0.04 per mcfe) in the same period of 2014 due to lower prices and an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes. Included in the first nine months 2015 is an $18.1 million ($0.05 per mcfe) impact fee compared to $19.3 million ($0.06 per mcfe) in the same period of 2014. General and administrative (“G&A”) expense was $46.2 million in third quarter 2015 compared to $55.0 million for third quarter 2014. The third quarter 2015 decrease of $8.8 million when compared to the same period of 2014 is primarily due to lower salaries and benefits, lower public relations costs and lower legal expenses which includes lower fines for impoundment leaks (third quarter of the prior year included fines of $4.9 million). At September 30, 2015, the number of G&A employees has declined 4% when compared to September 30, 2014. G&A expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 decreased $10.6 million when compared to the same period in the prior year due to lower stock-based compensation, lower public relations costs and lower legal expenses. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and performance shares granted to our employees and non-employee directors as part of compensation. On a per mcfe basis, third quarter 2015 G&A expense decreased 29% from third quarter 2014 and 25% from the first nine months 2014. The following table summarizes G&A expenses per mcfe for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       General and administrative  $  0.26        $  0.39        $  (0.13  )     (33  %)     $  0.30     $  0.39     $  (0.09  )  (23  %)    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.09           0.10           (0.01  )     (10  %)        0.10        0.14        (0.04  )  (29  %)    Total general and administrative expense  $  0.35        $  0.49        $  (0.14  )     (29  %)     $  0.40     $  0.53     $  (0.13  )  (25  %)   29  Interest expense was $42.9 million for third quarter 2015 compared to $39.2 million for third quarter 2014 and was $125.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $130.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The following table presents information about interest expense per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Bank credit facility  $  0.03        $  0.04        $  (0.01  )     (25  %)     $  0.03     $  0.04     $  (0.01  )  (25  %)    Senior notes     0.07           ¾           0.07        ¾  %        0.04        ¾        0.04     ¾  %    Subordinated notes     0.20           0.29           (0.09  )     (31  %)         0.24        0.35        (0.11  )  (31  %)    Amortization of deferred financing costs and other     0.02           0.02           ¾        ¾  %        0.02        0.03        (0.01  )  (33  %)    Total interest expense  $  0.32        $  0.35        $  (0.03  )     (9  %)      $  0.33     $  0.42     $  (0.09  )  (21  %)   On an absolute basis, the decrease in interest expense for third quarter 2015 from the same period of 2014 was primarily due to lower average interest rates on our total outstanding debt somewhat offset by higher average debt balances. In August 2015, we redeemed all of our $500.0 million 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020. In May 2015, we issued $750.0 million of 4.875% senior notes due 2025. In June 2014, we redeemed all of our $300.0 million 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for third quarter 2015 was $810.8 million compared to $599.3 million in third quarter 2014 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 1.7% in third quarter 2015 compared to 2.1% in third quarter 2014.  On an absolute basis, the decrease in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 from the same period of 2014 was primarily due to lower average interest rates on our total outstanding debt partially offset by higher outstanding debt balances. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $790.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $622.8 million for the same period of 2014 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 1.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to 2.1% in the same period of 2014. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) expense was $154.0 million in third quarter 2015 compared to $142.5 million in third quarter 2014. This increase is due to a 20% increase in production somewhat offset by a 10% decrease in depletion rates. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A expense, was $1.10 per mcfe in third quarter 2015 compared to $1.22 per mcfe in third quarter 2014. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. Our depletion rate per mcfe continues to decline due to drilling success and continued capital efficiencies in the Marcellus Shale and the mix of our production.  DD&A expense was $453.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $404.5 million in the same period of 2014. Depletion expense was $1.14 per mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $1.25 per mcfe in the same period of 2014. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014:        Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Depletion and amortization  $  1.10        $  1.22        $  (0.12  )     (10  %)     $  1.14     $  1.25     $  (0.11  )  (9  %)    Depreciation     0.02           0.03           (0.01  )     (33  %)        0.02        0.03        (0.01  )  (33  %)    Accretion and other     0.04           0.03           0.01        33  %         0.04        0.04        ¾     ¾  %    Total DD&A expense  $  1.16        $  1.28        $  (0.12  )     (9  %)      $  1.20     $  1.32     $  (0.12  )  (9  %)   Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $99.6 million in third quarter 2015 compared to $84.8 million in third quarter 2014. Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $284.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $235.7 million in the same period of 2014. These third party costs are higher than 2014 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering, compression and transportation agreements. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range). Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, deferred compensation plan expenses, loss on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of proved properties and termination costs. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants, PSUs and SARs grants. The  30  following table details the allocation of stock-based compensation to functional expense categories for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):         Three Months Ended September 30,        Nine Months Ended September 30,          2015        2014        2015     2014       Direct operating expense  $  609        $  720        $  2,149     $  3,509       Brokered natural gas and marketing expense     618           656           1,743        2,314       Exploration expense     688           1,033           2,171        3,408       General and administrative expense     11,512           11,556           38,545        43,856       Termination costs     (1  )        ¾           1,720        ¾       Total stock-based compensation  $  13,426        $  13,965        $  46,328     $  53,087      Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $32.3 million in third quarter 2015 compared to $28.7 million in third quarter 2014. Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $80.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $97.6 million in the same period of 2014. These costs were higher in third quarter 2015 when compared to third quarter 2014 with higher expenses related to company-owned gathering lines we received as part of the Conger Exchange of $5.0 million partially offset by lower transportation capacity charges. These costs were lower in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 when compared to the same period in 2014 with higher brokered gas volumes more than offset by significantly lower purchase prices and higher expenses related to company-owned gathering lines of $14.3 million. The three months ended September 30, 2014 included $3.5 million and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included $8.8 million of transportation capacity charges where we had taken firm capacity ahead of our production volumes. Exploration expense was $4.2 million in third quarter 2015 compared to $11.4 million in third quarter 2014 due to lower seismic costs and personnel and stock-based compensation. Exploration expense was $17.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $39.9 million in the same period of 2014. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):         Three Months EndedSeptember 30,        Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,          2015        2014        Change        %        2015     2014     Change     %       Seismic  $  110        $  5,827        $  (5,717  )     (98  %)     $  1,685     $  18,038     $  (16,353  )  (91  %)    Delay rentals and other     819           1,267           (448  )     (35  %)         3,577        6,821        (3,244  )  (48  %)    Personnel expense     2,637           3,316           (679  )     (20  %)         9,626        11,642        (2,016  )  (17  %)    Stock-based compensation expense     688           1,033           (345  )     (33  %)         2,171        3,408        (1,237  )  (36  %)    Dry hole expense     (19  )        ¾           (19  )     ¾  %        87        1        86     ¾  %    Total exploration expense  $  4,235        $  11,443        $  (7,208  )     (63  %)     $  17,146     $  39,910     $  (22,764  )  (57  %)   Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $12.4 million in third quarter 2015 compared to $13.4 million in third quarter 2014. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $36.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $32.8 million in the same period of 2014. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded. The increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 when compared to the same period of 2014 is primarily due to higher expected forfeitures in the Midcontinent. Termination costs were $6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These costs include $3.2 million of accrued building lease costs for our Oklahoma City office, additional severance and stock-based compensation for accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants for both our Oklahoma City office employees and other areas where we have determined a need to reduce personnel due, in part, to the low commodity price environment. 31  Deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of $43.7 million in third quarter 2015 compared to a gain of $46.2 million in third quarter 2014. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price decreased from $49.38 at June 30, 2015 to $32.12 at September 30, 2015. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price decreased from $86.95 at June 30, 2014 to $67.81 at September 30, 2014. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015 deferred compensation was a gain of $56.6 million compared to a gain of $37.7 million in the same period of 2014. Our stock price decreased from $53.45 at December 31, 2014 to $32.12 at September 30, 2015. In the same period of 2014, our stock price decreased from $84.31 at December 31, 2013 to $67.81 at September 30, 2014.  Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $22.5 million for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In August 2015, we redeemed our 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020 at 103.375% of par and we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $22.5 million which includes a call premium and expensing of deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 our loss on early extinguishment of debt was $24.6 million. In June 2014, we redeemed our 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019 at 104.0% of par and we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $24.6 million which includes a call premium and expensing of related deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt. Impairment of proved properties was $502.2 million in the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $25.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. We assess our proved natural gas and oil properties whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. The cash flows we use to assess proved property impairment includes numerous assumptions including (1) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves (2) results of future drilling activities (3) future commodity prices and (4) increases or decreases in production and capital costs. All inputs are evaluated at each measurement date. In third quarter 2015, impairment expense was recorded related to certain of our oil and gas properties in Northern Oklahoma and our legacy producing assets in Northwest Pennsylvania. In third quarter 2015, these producing assets accounted for less than 3% of our third quarter production. Due to falling commodity prices, our analysis of these properties determined that undiscounted cash flows were less than their carrying values. Impairment expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was recorded relating to certain of our natural gas and oil properties in Mississippi, West Texas and North Texas. Income tax (benefit) expense was a benefit of $134.8 million in third quarter 2015 compared to income tax expense of $93.5 million in third quarter 2014. For the third quarter, the effective tax rate was 30.9% in 2015 compared to 39.0% in 2014. Income tax benefit was $174.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to income tax expense of $230.5 million in the same period of 2014. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the effective tax rate was 30.8% compared to 39.7% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. In both the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we have increased our valuation allowances for state and federal net operating loss carryforwards and credits that we do not believe are realizable. The 2015 and 2014 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, permanent differences, changes in our valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets associated with senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation, which includes distributions from the deferred compensation plan, is expected to exceed the $1.0 million annual deductible limit provided under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and changes to our valuation allowances related to state and federal net operating loss carryforwards. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39% for the remainder of 2015, before any discrete tax items. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and because our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of September 30, 2015, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 95.9 Bcfe for the remainder of 2015, 262.4 Bcfe for 2016 and 7.3 Bcfe for 2017. We have also entered into basis hedges for 37,285,000 Mmbtus through March 2017. Net cash provided from operations in first nine months 2015 was $515.6 million compared to $654.9 million in first nine months 2014. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities from 2014 to 2015 reflects a 23% increase in production and lower operating costs more than offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 35%). As of September  32  30, 2015, we have hedged approximately 80% of our projected total production for the remainder of 2015, with more than 85% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first nine months 2015 was positive $4.1 million compared to negative $71.5 million for first nine months 2014.  Net cash used in investing activities from operations in first nine months 2015 was $946.0 million compared to $871.9 million in the same period of 2014.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we:         ●  spent $901.2 million on natural gas and oil property additions, which includes cash payments related to our prior year capital budget;         ●  spent $2.9 million on field service assets;        ●  spent $61.2 million on acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and         ●  received proceeds from asset sales of $14.8 million.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we:         ●  spent $867.3 million on natural gas and oil property additions;         ●  spent $9.5 million on field service assets;        ●  spent $145.5 million on acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and         ●  received proceeds from asset sales of $147.1 million.  Net cash provided from financing activities in first nine months 2015 was $430.5 million compared to $217.1 million in the same period of 2014. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through debt and equity offerings.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we:         ●  borrowed $1.9 billion and repaid $1.7 billion under our bank credit facility, ending the third quarter with a $987.0 million outstanding balance on our bank debt;         ●  received proceeds of $750.0 million from issuance of 4.875% senior notes due 2025;         ●  redeemed all $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020, including related expenses; and        ●  paid dividends of $20.3 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we:         ●  borrowed $1.7 billion and repaid $1.5 billion under our bank credit facility, ending the third quarter with $649.0 million of outstanding balance on our bank debt;         ●  redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.0% senior subordinated notes due 2019, including related expenses;        ●  received proceeds of $396.6 million from the issuance of 4.56 million shares of common stock; and        ●  paid dividends of $19.9 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first nine months 2015, we significantly reduced our operating costs per unit of production and we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2015, 2016 and 2017 to protect future cash flows. On March 31, 2015, our borrowing base and credit facility commitment were reaffirmed for the period from May 1, 2015 to May 1, 2016 along with various changes to certain financial covenants. 33  During the first nine months 2015, our net cash provided from operating activities of $515.6 million, proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes and proceeds from asset sales were used to fund approximately $965.3 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). Cash payments for capital expenditures in the first nine months 2015 would include payments related to our prior year capital budget. At September 30, 2015, we had $490,000 in cash and total assets of $8.4 billion.  Long-term debt at September 30, 2015 totaled $3.6 billion, including $987.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility, $750.0 million of senior notes and $1.9 billion of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at September 30, 2015 was $876.2 million. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A further material decline in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and operate profitably. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year, taking into account various factors including the commodity price environment. Our 2015 capital budget is approximately $870.0 million. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Credit Arrangements  As of September 30, 2015, we maintained a revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of $2.0 billion, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility, during a non-investment grade period, is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of October 16, 2019. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. Availability under the bank credit facility, during an investment grade period, is limited to aggregate lender commitments. As of September 30, 2015, the outstanding balance under our credit facility was $987.0 million. Additionally, we had $136.8 million of undrawn letters of credit leaving $876.2 million of committed borrowing capacity available under the facility at the end of third quarter 2015.  Our bank credit facility and our senior subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under our bank credit facility and the agreements relating to our subordinated notes). These agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, investments and financial ratios. We are in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2015. See Note 8 for additional information regarding our bank debt. Cash Dividend Payments  On September 1, 2015, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.8 million) on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on September 30, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 15, 2015. The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors. Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation and gathering commitments. As of September 30, 2015, we do not have any capital leases. As of September 30, 2015, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of September 30, 2015, we had a total of $136.8 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2014, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $264.0 million increase in our outstanding bank credit facility balance, issuance of $750.0 million of 4.875% senior notes, the redemption of all of our $500.0 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2020, and entry into new firm transportation and gathering contracts and new delivery commitments. The new firm transportation and gathering contracts increased our contractual obligations by approximately $476.3 million over the next fourteen years.  34  Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives, as we typically utilize commodity swap and collar contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our on-going development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. The fair value of these contracts which is represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination is based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX for natural gas and oil or Mont Belvieu for NGLs, approximated a pretax gain of $334.8 million at September 30, 2015. The contracts expire monthly through December 2017. At September 30, 2015, the following commodity-based derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed separately below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price                           Natural Gas                      2015     Collars     145,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.07–$ 4.56    2015     Swaps     727,500 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.63    2016     Swaps     630,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.42    2017     Swaps     20,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.49                           Crude Oil                      2015     Sold Swaps     11,250 bbls/day     $ 85.87    2015     Re-purchased Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 40.19    2016     Swaps     3,999 bbls/day     $ 66.09    2017     Swaps     500 bbls/day     $ 55.00      NGLs (C3-Propane)                      2015     Swaps     12,000 bbls/day     $ 0.55/gallon    2016     Swaps     5,500 bbls/day     $ 0.60/gallon      NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                      2015     Swaps     3,500 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon    2016     Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon      NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                      2015     Swaps     4,000 bbls/day     $ 1.16/gallon    2016     Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 1.23/gallon   In addition to the collars and swaps discussed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we received for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a loss of $2.0 million at September 30, 2015, the volumes are for 37,285,000 Mmbtu and they expire through March 2017. Interest Rates  At September 30, 2015, we had approximately $3.6 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.6 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 5.1%. Bank debt totaling $987.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 1.8% at September 30, 2015. The 30-day LIBOR Rate on September 30, 2015 was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2015 would cost us approximately $9.9 million in additional annual interest expense.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any significant off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments, some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  35  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2015 to continue to be a function of supply and demand and we believe, based on the lower commodity price environment, we will continue to see cost reductions. However, the timing and amount of such cost reductions cannot be predicted.        ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Changes in natural gas and NGLs prices affect us more than changes in oil prices because approximately 97% of our December 31, 2014 proved reserves are natural gas and NGLs. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015.  36  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. At September 30, 2015, our derivative program includes swaps and collars. These contracts expire monthly through December 2017. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of September 30, 2015, approximated a net unrealized pretax gain of $334.8 million. At September 30, 2015, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed below:      Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged     WeightedAverage Hedge Price     Fair MarketValue                               (in thousands)       Natural Gas                                  2015     Collars     145,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 4.07–$ 4.56     $  19,657       2015     Swaps     727,500 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.63     $  69,120       2016     Swaps     630,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.42     $  141,077       2017     Swaps      20,000 Mmbtu/day     $ 3.49     $  3,640                                          Crude Oil                                  2015     Sold Swaps     11,250 bbls/day     $ 85.87     $  41,450       2015     Re-purchased Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 40.19     $  1,287       2016     Swaps     3,999 bbls/day     $ 66.09     $  24,638       2017     Swaps     500 bbls/day     $ 55.00     $  406                                          NGLs (C3-Propane)                                  2015     Swaps     12,000 bbls/day     $ 0.55/gallon     $  3,609       2016     Swaps     5,500 bbls/day     $ 0.60/gallon     $  10,324                                          NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                                  2015     Swaps     3,500 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon     $  1,272       2016     Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 0.72/gallon     $  4,732                                          NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                                  2015     Swaps     4,000 bbls/day     $ 1.16/gallon     $  3,314       2016     Swaps     2,500 bbls/day     $ 1.23/gallon     $  10,232      We expect our NGLs production to continue to increase and we believe NGLs prices are somewhat seasonal, particularly for propane. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional and global markets. If we are not able to sell or store NGLs, we may be required to curtail production or shift our drilling activities to dry gas areas. Currently, there is little demand, or facilities to supply the existing demand elsewhere, for ethane in the Appalachian region. We have previously announced five ethane agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. Our Mariner East transportation agreement and our terminal/storage arrangements at Sunoco’s Marcus Hook facility in Pennsylvania are expected to begin ethane operations in late 2015. We cannot assure you that this facility will become available. The remaining two contract start dates are still in the planning or construction stages. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these five agreements, we may be required to curtail production or, as we have in the past, purchase natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. Therefore, in addition to the collars and swaps discussed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors. Basis swap agreements effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a loss of $2.0 million at September 30, 2015 and they settle monthly through March 2017. 37  The following table shows the fair value of our collars, swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical changes in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at September 30, 2015. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value        Hypothetical Changein Fair Value                         Increase of        Decrease of             Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%       Collars     $  19,657        $  (3,430  )     $  (8,492  )     $  3,453        $  8,645       Swaps        315,101           (110,082  )        (275,066  )        110,082           275,194       Basis swaps        (1,987  )        (172  )        (398  )        172           430      Our commodity-based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At September 30, 2015, our derivative counterparties include seventeen financial institutions, of which all but two are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior and senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At September 30, 2015, we had $3.6 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.6 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.1%. Bank debt totaling $987.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 1.8% on September 30, 2015. On September 30, 2015, the 30-day LIBOR Rate was approximately 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2015, would cost us approximately $9.9 million in additional annual interest expense.      ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2015 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.      38  PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 15 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part I Item 1 above for a summary of our legal proceedings, such information being incorporated herein by reference.  Environmental Proceedings Our subsidiary, Range Resources – Appalachia, LLC, was notified on May 11, 2015 by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”) that it intends to assess a civil penalty under the Clean Streams Law and the 2012 Oil and Gas Act in connection with one well in Lycoming County. The DEP has directed us to prevent methane and other substances from escaping from this gas well and polluting groundwater and a stream. We have considerable evidence that this well is not leaking and pre-drill testing of surrounding water wells showed the presence of methane in the water before commencement of our operations. While we intend to vigorously assert this position with the DEP; resolution of this matter may nonetheless result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.     ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.
