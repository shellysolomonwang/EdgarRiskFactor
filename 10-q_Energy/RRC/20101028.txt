Item 1A. Risk Factors as filed with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 filed with the SEC on July 27, 2010.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. These policies and estimates are described in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: accounting for natural gas, NGL and oil revenue, natural gas and oil properties, stock-based compensation, derivative financial instruments, asset retirement obligations and deferred income taxes.  Market Conditions   Prices for various quantities of natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists average NYMEX prices for natural gas and oil for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. There is no similar published benchmark for NGL prices.

Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview   We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas company, engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of primarily natural gas properties, mostly in the Southwestern and Appalachian regions of the United States. Our objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis.   During the first nine months of 2010, we completed several important initiatives and achieved several milestones as follows:       •   recorded our 31st consecutive quarter of sequential production growth;         •   achieved 12% year-over-year production growth;        •   daily production now exceeds 500,000 mcfe per day;        •   direct operating expense per mcfe declined 16% when compared to the prior year;        •   sold our tight gas sand properties in Ohio for proceeds of $323.0 million;        •   issued $500.0 million senior subordinated notes for proceeds of $491.3 million;        •   used a portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of our 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020 to redeem all $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013; and        •   entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2010, 2011 and 2012.    21    Table of Contents  Third Quarter Highlights   Total revenues increased $23.3 million, or 11% for third quarter 2010 over the same period of 2009. The increase includes a $17.4 million increase in natural gas, NGL and oil sales and an increase in derivative fair value income (loss) of $10.4 million. Natural gas, NGL and oil sales vary due to changes in volumes of production sold and realized commodity prices. Due to lower derivative settlements and volatility in commodity prices, realized prices decreased from the same period of the prior year, which was more than offset by an increase in production, including a 136% increase in natural gas liquid production primarily due to increased liquids-rich production in our Appalachia area. For third quarter 2010, production increased 15% from the same period of the prior year while realized prices (including all derivative settlements) declined 22%. We believe natural gas, NGL and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new regulations, new technology, and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for 2010, 2011 and 2012, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower realized prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future.   We continue to focus our efforts on improving our operating efficiency. These efforts resulted in 4% lower direct operating expense per mcfe for third quarter 2010 when compared to the same period of the prior year. We continue to experience increases in general and administrative expenses per mcfe as we continue to hire employees to staff our Marcellus Shale operations, along with increasing public relations costs in the Marcellus Shale associated with our efforts to educate the public about the benefits of natural gas.  Natural Gas, NGL and Oil Sales Production and Realized Price Calculation   Our natural gas, NGL and oil sales vary from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and volumes of production sold. Hedges included in the consolidated statement of operations category called natural gas, NGL and oil sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Cash settlements of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in derivative fair value income (loss) in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The following table summarizes the primary components of natural gas, NGL and oil sales for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2010     2009     Change     %     2010     2009     Change     %       Gas wellhead   $ 129,557     $ 97,004     $ 32,553       34 %   $ 416,250     $ 300,646     $ 115,604       38 %   Gas hedges realized     15,616       54,122       (38,506 )     (71 %)     35,148       146,594       (111,446 )     (76 %)                                                           Total gas sales     145,173       151,126       (5,953 )     (4 %)     451,398       447,240       4,158       1 %                                                                                                                               NGL     43,562       16,887       26,675       158 %     112,061       36,455       75,606       207 %                                                                                                                               Oil wellhead     30,825       33,869       (3,044 )     (9 %)     99,622       101,892       (2,270 )     (2 %)   Oil hedges realized     —       240       (240 )     (100 %)     23       12,247       (12,224 )     (100 %)                                                           Total oil sales     30,825       34,109       (3,284 )     (10 %)     99,645       114,139       (14,494 )     13 %                                                                                                                               Combined wellhead     203,944       147,760       56,184       38 %     627,933       438,993       188,940       43 %   Combined hedges realized     15,616       54,362       (38,746 )     (71 %)     35,171       158,841       (123,670 )     (78 %)                                                           Total natural gas, NGL and oil sales   $ 219,560     $ 202,122     $ 17,438       9 %   $ 663,104     $ 597,834     $ 65,270       11 %                                                              Our production continues to grow through continued drilling success as we place new wells into production, partially offset by the natural decline of our wells and asset sales. For third quarter 2010, total production volumes, when compared to the same period of the prior year, increased 44% in our Appalachian area and decreased 6% in our Southwestern area. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, our production volumes as compared to the same period of the prior year, increased 44% in our Appalachia area and decreased 9% in our Southwestern area. For third quarter 2010, NGL production increased 136% from the same period of the prior year primarily due to increased liquids-rich gas production in our Appalachia area along with an increase in processing capacity in the region. In addition, in third quarter 2010 we began reporting certain NGL production that had historically been combined with our natural gas production. This change affects our Southwestern area volumes only, where we previously only reported NGL volumes from significant fields and increased our third quarter production volumes approximately 2%. Crude oil production declined primarily due to the sale of oil properties in West Texas effective September 30, 2009. Our production for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 is shown below:  22    Table of Contents                                                                              Three Months Ended   Nine Months Ended       September 30,   September 30,       2010   2009   Change   %   2010   2009   Change   %     Production(a):                                                                   Natural gas (mcf)     35,818,171       33,747,972       2,070,199       6 %     104,320,417       96,205,898       8,114,519       8 %   NGLs (bbls)     1,279,751       543,005       736,746       136 %     2,989,106       1,492,259       1,496,847       100 %   Crude oil (bbls)     461,145       534,399       (73,254 )     (14 %)     1,460,565       1,987,603       (527,038 )     (27 %)   Total (mcfe)(b)     46,263,547       40,212,396       6,051,151       15 %     131,018,443       117,085,070       13,933,373       12 %                                                                       Average daily production(a):                                                                   Natural gas (mcf)     389,328       366,826       22,502       6 %     382,126       352,403       29,723       8 %   NGLs (bbls)     13,911       5,902       8,009       136 %     10,949       5,466       5,483       100 %   Crude oil (bbls)     5,012       5,809       (797 )     (14 %)     5,350       7,281       (1,931 )     (27 %)   Total (mcfe)(b)     502,865       437,091       65,774       15 %     479,921       428,883       51,038       12 %                (a)   Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.

Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements) received was $4.97 per mcfe in third quarter 2010 compared to $6.35 per mcfe in the same period of the prior year. Our average realized price calculation (including all derivative settlements) includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualify for hedge accounting, except that in the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we have excluded from average realized price calculations a $15.7 million gain related to an early settlement of oil collars. Our realized prices for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2010, when compared to the same periods of 2009, were negatively impacted by settled losses on our basis swaps and by premiums paid for natural gas collars that were settled during the periods. This reduced our average realized price by $0.12 per mcfe in the third quarter 2010 and $0.20 per mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a decrease of $0.02 per mcfe in the third quarter 2009 and an increase of $0.02 per mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2009.

Derivative fair value income (loss) was a gain of $58.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a gain of $65.2 million in the same period of 2009. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting  23    Table of Contents  and are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value income (loss) in our accompanying consolidated statements of operation. We have also entered into basis swap agreements, which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are also marked to market. Mark-to-market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from non-hedge derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets. Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in this statement of operations category, is associated with our hedging contracts that qualify for hedge accounting.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we recorded a total gain of $77.4 million from the sale of our tight gas sand properties in Ohio and received proceeds of $323.0 million.   Other income (loss) for third quarter 2010 was a loss of $1.0 million compared to a loss of $475,000 in the same period of 2009. Third quarter 2010 includes a loss from equity method investments of $845,000. The third quarter of 2009 includes a loss from equity method investments of $1.0 million. Other income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 improved from a loss of $6.7 million in 2009 to a loss of $2.0 million in 2010. Loss from equity method investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was a loss of $1.8 million compared to a loss of $6.5 million in the same period of 2009. The nine months ended September 30, 2009 also includes an impairment of one of our equity method investments of $3.0 million.   We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about these expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009:                                                                              Three Months Ended   Nine Months Ended       September 30,   September 30,       2010   2009   Change   %   2010   2009   Change   %     Direct operating expense   $ 0.74     $ 0.77     $ (0.03 )     (4 %)   $ 0.73     $ 0.87     $ (0.14 )     (16 %)   Production and ad valorem tax expense     0.19       0.19       —       — %     0.19       0.20       (0.01 )     (5 %)   General and administrative expense     0.79       0.74       0.05       7 %     0.77       0.72       0.05       7 %   Interest expense     0.73       0.76       (0.03 )     (4 %)     0.72       0.74       (0.02 )     (3 %)   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense     1.98       2.42       (0.44 )     (18 %)     2.07       2.31       (0.24 )     (10 %)      Direct operating expense increased $3.2 million in third quarter 2010 to $34.3 million. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties. We incurred $1.1 million ($0.02 per mcfe) of workover costs in third quarter 2010 versus $2.7 million ($0.07 per mcfe) in 2009. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses for third quarter 2010 decreased $0.03, or 4%, from the same period of 2009 with the decrease primarily  24    Table of Contents  due to lower workover costs. We expect to continue to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating costs relative to our other operating areas. Direct operating expense was $95.1 million for the first nine months of 2010 compared to $101.5 million in the same period of the prior year. We incurred $3.8 million ($0.03 per mcfe) of workover costs in the first nine months of 2010 compared to $5.3 million ($0.05 per mcfe) in 2009. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses for the nine months 2010 decreased $0.14, or 16% from the same period of the prior year with the decrease consisting primarily of lower workover costs ($0.02 per mcfe), lower water disposal costs ($0.02 per mcfe), lower utilities ($0.01 per mcfe), lower overall well service costs and asset sales. Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009:                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2010     2009     Change     %     2010     2009     Change     %       Lease operating expense   $ 0.71     $ 0.68     $ 0.03       4 %   $ 0.69     $ 0.80     $ (0.11 )     (14 %)   Workovers     0.02       0.07       (0.05 )     (71 %)     0.03       0.05       (0.02 )     (40 %)   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.01       0.02       (0.01 )     (50 %)     0.01       0.02       (0.01 )     (50 %)                                                           Total direct operating expenses   $ 0.74     $ 0.77     $ (0.03 )     (4 %)   $ 0.73     $ 0.87     $ (0.14 )     (16 %)                                                              Third quarter 2009 included $3.8 million of operating costs related to properties sold during 2009 and in first quarter 2010. On a per mcfe basis, excluding expenses on these properties that have been sold, our 2009 direct operating expense would have been $0.73. The first nine months of 2009 included $15.8 million of operating costs related to properties sold during 2009 and in first quarter 2010. On a per mcfe basis, excluding expenses on these properties that have been sold, our 2009 direct operating expense would have been $0.79.   Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. For the third quarter, these taxes increased $1.3 million or 17% from the same period of the prior year due to higher market prices and higher property taxes which were somewhat offset by an increase in production volumes not subject to production taxes. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes were $0.19 in both the third quarter 2010 and the third quarter 2009. For the first nine months of 2010, these taxes increased 7% from the same period of the prior year due to higher market prices which was offset by lower property taxes and an increase in production volumes not subject to production taxes. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes decreased to $0.19 in the first nine months of 2010 compared to $0.20 in the same period of 2009.   General and administrative expense for third quarter 2010 increased $6.6 million or 22% from the same period of the prior year due primarily to higher community relations costs ($3.8 million), higher salaries and benefits ($1.6 million), and higher office expenses, including information technology. General and administrative expense for the first nine months of 2010 increased $16.6 million or 20% from the same period of the prior year due to higher stock-based compensation ($3.7 million), an increase in legal fees and lawsuit settlements ($3.2 million), higher salaries and benefits ($2.3 million), higher community relations costs ($3.9 million) and higher office expenses, including information technology and industry trade association dues. Stock-based compensation included in this category represents amortization of restricted stock grants and expense related to SAR grants. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009:                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2010     2009     Change     %     2010     2009     Change     %       General and administrative   $ 0.62     $ 0.55     $ 0.07       13 %   $ 0.57     $ 0.53     $ 0.04       8 %   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)     0.17       0.19       (0.02 )     (11 %)     0.20       0.19       0.01       5 %                                                           Total general and administrative expenses   $ 0.79     $ 0.74     $ 0.05       7 %   $ 0.77     $ 0.72     $ 0.05       7 %                                                             25    Table of Contents   Interest expense for third quarter 2010 increased $3.2 million from the same period of the prior year due to the refinancing of certain debt from floating to higher fixed rates which was somewhat offset by lower overall debt balances. In August 2010, we issued $500.0 million of 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020, which added $4.6 million of interest costs in third quarter 2010. The proceeds from the issuance were used to retire our 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013 and to lower our floating interest rate bank debt due 2012, to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for third quarter 2010 was $361.2 million compared to $430.7 million for the same period of the prior year and the weighted average interest rate was 2.3% in third quarter 2010 compared to 2.2% in the same period of the prior year. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased $8.1 million or 9% from the same period of the prior year due to the refinancing of certain debt from floating to higher fixed rates which was somewhat offset by lower overall debt balances. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, was $380.6 million compared to $644.5 million for the same period of the prior year and the weighted average interest rate was 2.2% in the first nine months of 2010 compared to 2.5% in the same period of the prior year.   Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) decreased $5.4 million, or 6%, to $91.8 million in third quarter 2010. The decrease was due to a 17% decrease in depletion rates partially offset by a 15% increase in production. On a per mcfe basis, DD&A decreased from $2.42 in third quarter 2009 to $1.98 in third quarter 2010. In the first nine months of 2010, DD&A increased $1.1 million due to a 12% increase in production which was significantly offset by a 9% decrease in depletion rates. Depletion rates are declining due to our lower finding and development costs and the mix of our production. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009:                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2010     2009     Change     %     2010     2009     Change     %       Depletion and amortization   $ 1.87     $ 2.26     $ (0.39 )     (17 %)   $ 1.95     $ 2.15     $ (0.20 )     (9 %)   Depreciation     0.08       0.12       (0.04 )     (33 %)     0.09       0.12       (0.03 )     (25 %)   Accretion and other     0.03       0.04       (0.01 )     (25 %)     0.03       0.04       (0.01 )     (25 %)                                                           Total DD&A expense   $ 1.98     $ 2.42     $ (0.44 )     (18 %)   $ 2.07     $ 2.31     $ (0.24 )     (10 %)                                                              Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, termination costs, deferred compensation plan expenses, loss on early extinguishment of debt and impairment of proved properties. In the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, stock-based compensation represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and expenses related to SAR grants. In third quarter 2010, stock-based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($606,000), exploration expense ($1.0 million) and general and administrative expense ($7.8 million) for a total of $9.7 million. In third quarter 2009, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($798,000), exploration expense ($979,000) and general and administrative expense ($7.5 million) for a total of $9.5 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2010, stock based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($1.7 million), exploration expense ($3.2 million), general and administrative expense ($26.4 million) and termination costs ($2.8 million) for a total of $35.1 million. In the nine months ended September 30, 2009, stock based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($2.4 million), exploration expense ($2.9 million), general and administrative expense ($22.7 million) for a total of $28.7 million.   Exploration expense increased $4.3 million in third quarter 2010 with higher dry hole costs and higher delay rentals. Exploration expense increased $8.7 million in the first nine months of 2010 primarily due to higher delay rental costs and higher dry hole costs partially offset by lower seismic costs. The higher delay rental payments, or costs to defer the commencement of drilling, is primarily attributable to our Marcellus Shale operations. The following table details our exploration-related expenses for the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 (in thousands):                                                                              Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended         September 30,     September 30,         2010     2009     Change     %     2010     2009     Change     %       Dry hole expense   $ 1,662     $ 212     $ 1,450       684 %   $ 1,662     $ 343     $ 1,319       385 %   Seismic     6,433       6,267       166       3 %     14,992       20,182       (5,190 )     (26 %)   Personnel expense     2,892       2,527       365       14 %     8,658       8,232       426       5 %   Stock-based compensation expense     1,018       979       39       4 %     3,097       2,933       164       5 %   Delay rentals and other     3,231       917       2,314       252 %     15,935       3,919       12,016       307 %                                                           Total exploration expense   $ 15,236     $ 10,902     $ 4,334       40 %   $ 44,344     $ 35,609     $ 8,735       25 %                                                             26    Table of Contents   Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties expense was $20.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $24.1 million during the same period of 2009. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $46.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $84.6 million during the same period for 2009. Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties in 2009 was primarily related to higher Barnett Shale lease expirations. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate an impairment of value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success.   Termination costs in the first nine months of 2010 includes severance costs of $5.1 million related to the sale of our tight gas sand properties in Ohio and $2.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of SARs and restricted stock as part of the severance agreement for our Ohio personnel. Termination costs in the three months and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 represent severance costs related to the closing of our Houston office.   Deferred compensation plan expense was income of $5.3 million in third quarter 2010 compared to expense of $16.4 million in the same period of the prior year. This non-cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in the deferred compensation plan. Our deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense in the accompanying statement of operations. Our stock price decreased from $40.15 at June 30, 2010 to $38.13 at September 30, 2010. During the same period in the prior year, our stock price increased from $41.41 at June 30, 2009 to $49.36 at September 30, 2009. Deferred compensation plan expense was income of $25.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to expense of $29.6 million in the same period of the prior year. Our stock price decreased from $49.85 at December 31, 2009 to $38.13 at September 30, 2010. During the same nine month period of 2009, our stock price increased from $34.39 at December 31, 2008 to $49.36 at September 30, 2009.   Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the third quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $5.4 million. In August 2010 we redeemed our 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013 at a redemption price equal to 101.229%. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $5.4 million which includes call premium costs of $2.5 million and expensing of related deferred financing costs on the repurchased debt.   Impairment of proved properties in the first nine months of 2010 of $6.5 million was recognized due to declining gas prices and is related to a portion of our Gulf Coast properties. Our estimated fair value of producing properties is generally calculated as the discounted present value of future net cash flows. Our estimates of cash flow were based on the latest available proved reserve and production information and management’s estimates of future product prices and costs, based on available information such as forward strip prices at the time of the impairment.   Income tax (benefit) expense for third quarter 2010 decreased to a benefit of $5.9 million from a benefit of $15.3 million in third quarter 2009, reflecting a 69% improvement in net loss from operations before taxes compared to the same period of 2009. Third quarter 2010 provided for tax benefit at an effective rate of 41.9% compared to tax benefit at an effective rate of 33.9% in the same period of 2009. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased to an expense of $49.5 million from a benefit of $19.0 million in the same period of 2009, reflecting a significant increase in income from operations before taxes compared to the same period of 2009. The nine months ended September 30, 2010 provided for tax expense at an effective tax rate of 38.7% compared to a tax benefit at an effective tax rate of 33.8% in the same period of the prior year. Third quarter 2010 includes $617,000 additional benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance for capital losses compared to additional expense of $387,000 related to valuation allowances in the same period of 2009. The nine months ended September 30, 2009 included additional expense of $1.1 million for valuation allowances. The increase in effective tax rates is also due to an increase in non-deductible expenses and an increase in the proportion of our business being derived from higher tax rate jurisdictions. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 39% for the remainder of 2010.  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Capital Commitments   Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with both uncommitted and committed availability, asset sales and access to both the debt and equity capital markets. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. During the first six months of 2010, we sold our shallow tight sand Ohio properties for proceeds of approximately $323.0 million. We have used a portion of these proceeds to purchase proved and unproved properties primarily in Virginia. The remainder of these proceeds was used to repay amounts under our bank credit facility. In the first nine months of 2010, we also entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2010, 2011 and 2012 to protect future cash flows. As part of our semi-annual bank review completed October 8, 2010, our borrowing base and facility amounts were reaffirmed at $1.5 billion and $1.25 billion.  27    Table of Contents   During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, our cash provided from operating activities was $398.9 million and we spent $602.0 million on capital expenditures and $249.7 million on proved and unproved property purchases. At September 30, 2010, we had $2.1 million in cash, total assets of $5.8 billion and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 41.8%. Long-term debt at September 30, 2010 totaled $1.9 billion, which included $165.0 million of bank credit facility debt and $1.7 billion of senior subordinated notes. Available committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility at September 30, 2010 was $1.1 billion.   In June 2009, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability, subject to market conditions, to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of registered debt and equity securities.   We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year. Our 2010 capital budget (excluding acquisitions) now stands at $1.2 billion and focuses on projects we believe will generate and lay the foundation for economic, long-term production growth. In the past, we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling. We continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities; however, the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable.   Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves, which is typical in the capital-intensive oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, our long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. Sustained lower prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.   Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Credit Arrangements   On September 30, 2010, the bank credit facility had a $1.5 billion borrowing base and a $1.25 billion facility amount. The borrowing base represents an amount approved by the bank group that can be borrowed based on our assets, while our $1.25 billion facility amount is the amount we have requested that the banks commit to fund pursuant to the credit agreement. The bank credit facility provides for a borrowing base subject to redeterminations semi-annually each April and October and for event-driven unscheduled redeterminations. Remaining credit availability was $1.0 billion on October 25, 2010. Our bank group is comprised of twenty-six commercial banks, with no one bank holding more than 5.0% of the bank credit facility. We believe our large number of banks and relatively low hold levels allow for significant lending capacity should we elect to increase our $1.25 billion commitment up to the $1.5 billion borrowing base and also allow for flexibility should there be additional consolidation within the banking sector.   Our bank credit facility and our indentures governing our senior subordinated notes all contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, sell assets, enter into hedging contracts change the nature of our business or operations, merge or consolidate or make certain investments. In addition, we are required to maintain a ratio of debt to EBITDAX (as defined in the credit agreement) of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0 and a current ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of no less than 1.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2010. Please see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.  Cash Flow   Cash flows from operating activities primarily are affected by production and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operating activities also are impacted by changes in working capital. We  28    Table of Contents  sell substantially all of our natural gas, NGL and oil production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. However, we generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated future natural gas and oil production for the next 12 to 24 months. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowing under the credit facility. As of September 30, 2010, we have entered into derivative agreements covering 31.4 Bcfe for 2010, 161.0 Bcfe for 2011 and 40.6 Bcfe for 2012.   Net cash provided from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $398.9 million compared to $443.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2010 was lower than the same period of the prior year, as higher production from development activity was offset by lower realized prices and higher operating costs. Net cash provided from operating activities is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) in the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was an increase of $29.3 million compared to a decrease of $11.1 million in the same period of the prior year.   Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $528.8 million compared to $385.1 million in the same period of 2009. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we:       •   spent $589.8 million on oil and gas property additions;        •   spent $114.7 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale;        •   spent $135.0 million on the purchase of proved and unproved property in Virginia; and        •   received proceeds of $327.5 million primarily from the sale of Ohio oil and gas properties.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we:       •   spent $425.4 million on oil and gas property additions;        •   spent $118.7 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and        •   received proceeds of $182.2 million primarily from the sale of West Texas oil and gas properties.     Net cash provided from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $128.3 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of $58.6 million in the same period of 2009. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we:       •   borrowed $784.0 million and repaid $943.0 million under our bank credit facility, ending the period with $159.0 million lower bank credit facility balance;        •   issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020 at par; and        •   redeemed $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013 at a redemption price of 101.229%.     During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we:       •   borrowed $582.0 million and repaid $877.0 million under our bank credit facility, ending the period with $295.0 million lower bank credit facility balance; and        •   issued $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8% senior subordinated notes due 2019, at a discount.    Dividends   On September 30, 2010, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.4 million) on our common stock, which was paid on September 30, 2010 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 15, 2010.  Capital Requirements and Contractual Cash Obligations   We currently estimate our 2010 capital spending will approximate $1.2 billion (excluding acquisitions) and based on current projections is expected to be funded with internal cash flow, property sales, our bank credit facility and the capital markets. Acreage purchases during the first nine months include $98.2 million of purchases in the Marcellus Shale and $8.8 million in the Barnett Shale, which were funded with borrowings under our credit facility. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, $626.2 million of our development and exploration spending was funded with internal cash flow and borrowings under our bank credit facility. We monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis, adjusting the amount up or down and between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may choose to sell assets, issue subordinated notes or other debt securities, or issue additional shares of stock to fund capital expenditures or acquisitions, extend maturities or repay debt.  29    Table of Contents   Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, transportations commitments and other purchase obligations. The table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of September 30, 2010 (in thousands).

We expect to renew our bank credit facility, but there is no assurance that can be accomplished. Interest paid on our bank credit facility would be approximately $3.8 million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance.     (b)   Derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of September 30, 2010. While such payments will be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production, production receipts may be received after our payments to counterparties, which can result in borrowings under our bank credit facility.     (c)   The ultimate settlement and timing cannot be precisely determined in advance.     (d)   This table excludes the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets.   Other Contingencies   We are involved in various legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or consolidated financial position.  Hedging – Natural Gas and Oil Prices   We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. Historically, these contracts consisted of collars and fixed price swaps. In September 2010, we also entered into call options where we sold call options on a portion of our anticipated oil production in exchange for a premium received from the counterparty. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. Reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital program. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. In light of current worldwide economic uncertainties, we recently have employed a strategy to hedge a portion of our production looking out 12 to 24 months from each quarter. At September 30, 2010, we had collars covering 209.5 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $5.55 and $6.56 per mcf and 0.8 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $70.56 and $81.54 per barrel. At September 30, we also had sold call options covering 3.1 million barrels of oil at a weighted average price of $81.77. Their fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination, based on a comparison of contract prices and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on September 30, 2010 was a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $201.0 million. The contracts expire monthly through December 2012. Settled transaction gains and losses for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases in natural gas, NGLs and oil sales in the period the hedged production is sold. In the first nine months of 2010, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales included realized hedging gains of $35.2 million compared to gains of $158.8 million in the same period of 2009.   At September 30, 2010, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                                                      Average   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Hedge Price         Natural Gas                                 2010     Collars   335,000 Mmbtu/day     $5.56-$7.20           2011     Collars   408,200 Mmbtu/day     $5.56-$6.48           2012     Collars   80,993 Mmbtu/day     $5.50-$6.25                                             Crude Oil                                 2010     Collars   1,000 bbls/day     $75.00-$93.75           2012     Collars   2,000 bbls/day     $70.00-$80.00           2011     Call options   5,500 bbls/day     $80.00           2012     Call options   3,000 bbls/day     $85.00        Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as a hedge but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas and oil production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value as unrealized derivative gains and losses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts as derivative fair value income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2010, derivatives on 37.5 Bcfe no longer qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting.   In addition to the collars and call options above, we have entered into basis swap agreements that do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market. The price we receive for our production can be less than NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a net unrealized pre-tax loss of $2.9 million at September 30, 2010.  30    Table of Contents  Interest Rates   At September 30, 2010, we had $1.9 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.7 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Bank debt totaling $165.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which approximated 2.3% at September 30, 2010. The 30-day LIBOR rate on September 30, 2010 was 0.3%.  Inflation and Changes in Prices   Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes natural gas and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. During third quarter 2010, we received an average of $3.62 per mcf of gas and $66.84 per barrel of oil before derivative contracts compared to $2.87 per mcf of gas and $63.38 per barrel of oil in the same period of the prior year. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and accelerated through the middle of 2008, commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly. The higher prices led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These cost trends put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on capital costs. Due to the decline in commodity prices since then, costs have moderated. We expect costs in 2010 and 2011 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.  31    Table of Contents     ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposures. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk   Our major market risk is exposure to natural gas, NGL and oil prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Natural gas, NGL and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years.  Commodity Price Risk   We periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our natural gas and oil production. These arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of natural gas and oil price fluctuations. Some of our derivatives have been swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. In September 2010, we also entered into call option derivative contracts under which we sold call options in exchange for a premium from the counterparty. We took advantage of attractive strip prices in 2011 and 2012 and sold oil call options to our counterparties in exchange for 2011 and 2012 natural gas collars with prices above the current market price. Historically, we applied hedge accounting to derivatives utilized to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and oil production. Accordingly, we recorded the change in the fair value of our swap and collar contracts under the balance sheet caption accumulated other comprehensive income and into natural gas, NGLs and oil sales when the forecasted sale of production occurred. Any hedge ineffectiveness associated with contracts qualifying for and designated as a cash flow hedge is reported currently each period in derivative fair value income or loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting but provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas and oil production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Under this method, the contracts are carried at their fair value in unrealized derivative gains and in our consolidated balance sheets. We recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related to these contracts in derivative fair value income (loss) in our consolidated statements of operations. Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Our derivative counterparties include fourteen financial institutions, thirteen of which are in our bank group. J. Aron & Company is the counterparty not in our bank group. At September 30, 2010, our net derivative payable includes a payable to J. Aron & Company of $316,000. None of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions that would require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date.   As of September 30, 2010, we had collars covering 209.5 Bcf of gas and 0.8 million barrels of oil and oil call options for 3.1 million barrels. These contracts expire monthly through December 2012. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of September 30, 2010, approximated a net unrealized pre-tax gain of $201.0 million.   We expect our NGL production to continue to increase. We currently have not entered into any NGL derivative contracts. In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGL production, we believe NGL prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the percentage of NGL prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary based on product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand.  32    Table of Contents   At September 30, 2010, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                                                                              Fair Market Value                                   as of                                   September 30,                                   2010   Period   Contract Type   Volume Hedged   Average Hedge Price   Asset (Liability)                                   (in thousands)     Natural Gas                                     2010     Collars   335,000 Mmbtu/day     $5.56-$7.20     $ 50,238       2011     Collars   408,200 Mmbtu/day     $5.56-$6.48     $ 179,740       2012     Collars   80,993 Mmbtu/day     $5.50-$6.25     $ 18,496                                             Crude Oil                                     2010     Collars   1,000 bbls/day     $75.00-$93.75     $ 53       2012     Collars   2,000 bbls/day     $70.00-$80.00     $ (8,251 )     2011     Call options   5,500 bbls/day     $80.00     $ (23,440 )     2012     Call options   3,000 bbls/day     $85.00     $ (15,863 )     Other Commodity Risk   We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. In addition to the collars and call options detailed above, we have entered into basis swap agreements, which do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market. The price we receive for our gas production can be less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements that effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the basis swaps was a net realized pre-tax loss of $2.9 million at September 30, 2010.   The following table shows the fair value of our collars and call options and the hypothetical change in the fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at September 30, 2010 (in thousands):                                                              Hypothetical Change in   Hypothetical Change in               Fair Value   Fair Value               Increase of   Decrease of       Fair Value   10%   25%   10%   25%     Collars   $ 240,276     $ (85,388 )   $ (208,742 )   $ 88,404     $ 226,001     Call options     (39,302 )     (18,568 )     (50,511 )     15,842       33,369        Interest rate risk. At September 30, 2010, we had $1.9 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.7 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Senior bank debt totaling $165.0 million bore interest at floating rates averaging 2.3%. A 1% increase or decrease in short-term interest rates would affect interest expense by approximately $1.7 million per year.     ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive  33    Table of Contents  officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2010 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2010 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  34    Table of Contents     PART II – OTHER INFORMATION     ITEM 1A.
