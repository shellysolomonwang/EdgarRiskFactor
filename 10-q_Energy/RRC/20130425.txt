Item 1A. Risk Factors as filed with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2013.  Overview of Our Business  We are a Fort Worth, Texas-based independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil company primarily engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian and Southwestern regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments.  Our objective is to build stockholder value through consistent growth in reserves and production on a cost-efficient basis. Our strategy to achieve our objective is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We include condensate in our crude oil captions below. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Our corporate headquarters is located at 100 Throckmorton Street, Fort Worth, Texas.  Recent Developments  On February 26, 2013, we signed a definitive agreement to sell certain of our oil and gas properties in New Mexico and West Texas for a purchase price of $275.0 million, subject to normal post-closing adjustments. We closed this disposition on April 1, 2013 and we expect to recognize a gain of approximately $84.0 million in the second quarter.  Market Conditions  Prices for our products significantly impact our revenue, net income and cash flow. Natural gas, NGLs and oil are commodities and prices for commodities are inherently volatile. The following table lists average New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) prices for natural gas and oil for three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.                         Three Months Ended March 31,           2013  2012            Average NYMEX prices (a)       Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 3.35   $ 2.77   Oil (per bbl)   $ 94.25   $ 103.13   (a) Based on weighted average of bid week prompt month prices.      27      Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview of First Quarter 2013 Results  During first quarter 2013, we achieved the following financial and operating results:          •  increased revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil by 25% from the same period of 2012;         •  achieved 32% production growth from the same period of 2012;         •  continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale by growing production, proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage;         •  continued expansion of our activities in the horizontal Mississippian oil play by growing production and acquiring additional unproved acreage;         •  reduced direct operating expenses per mcfe 22% from the same period of 2012;         •  reduced our depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) rate 13%;     •  issued $750.0 million of new 5% senior subordinated notes due 2023;          •  entered into additional derivative contracts for 2013, 2014 and 2015; and         •  realized $201.2 million of cash flow from operating activities. Total revenues increased $68.3 million or 27% in first quarter 2013 over the same period of 2012. This increase was due to significantly higher production volumes partially offset by an increase in the mark-to-market loss from derivatives and lower realized prices. Our first quarter 2013 production growth was due to the continued success of our drilling program, particularly in the Marcellus Shale. First quarter 2013 natural gas production increased 33% from the comparable period of 2012 and, as we continue to focus our efforts on the growth of our liquids production, first quarter production for oil and NGLs increased over 29% from the same period of the prior year.  We believe natural gas, NGLs and oil prices will remain volatile and will be affected by, among other things, weather, the U.S. and worldwide economy, new technology and the level of oil and gas production in North America and worldwide. Although we have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our production volumes for the remainder of 2013, 2014 and 2015, a sustained lower price environment would result in lower prices for unprotected volumes and reduce the prices that we can enter into derivative contracts for additional volumes in the future. As a result of relatively higher current prices for oil and NGLs than for natural gas, we continue to focus our capital budget expenditures on higher return oil and liquids-rich gas drilling activities.  Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  Our revenues vary primarily as a result of changes in realized commodity prices, production volumes and the value of certain of our derivative contracts. We generally sell natural gas, NGLs and oil under two types of agreements, which are common in our industry. Revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales include netback arrangements where we sell natural gas and oil at the wellhead and collect a price, net of transportation incurred by the purchaser. In this instance, we record revenue at the price we receive from the purchaser. Revenues are also realized from sales arrangements where we sell natural gas or oil at a specific delivery point and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no transportation deduction. Third party transportation costs we incur to get our commodity to the delivery point are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense. Hedges included in natural gas, NGLs and oil sales reflect settlements on those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting. Cash settlements and changes in the market value of derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges are included in derivative fair value income or loss in the statement of operations. For more information on revenues from derivative contracts that are not accounted for as hedges, see Derivative fair value loss discussion below. Effective March 1, 2013, we elected to de-designate all commodity contracts that were previously designated as cash flow hedges and elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.        28      In first quarter 2013, natural gas, NGLs and oil sales increased 25% from the same period of 2012 with a 32% increase in production partially offset by a 5% decrease in realized prices. The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs and oil sales for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):                                       Three Months Ended March 31,           2013   2012   Change  %                  Natural gas, NGLs and oil sales           Gas wellhead   $ 217,088    $ 128,068    $ 89,020   70%    Gas hedges realized (a)  35,478   57,629   (22,151)   (38%)                 Total gas revenue   $ 252,566    $ 185,697    $ 66,869   36%                  Total NGLs revenue   $ 67,571    $ 76,498    $ (8,927)   (12%)                 Oil wellhead   $ 77,080    $ 55,422    $ 21,658   39%    Oil hedges realized (a)  1,022   —    1,022   — %                  Total oil revenue   $ 78,102    $ 55,422    $ 22,680   41%                  Combined wellhead   $ 361,739    $ 259,988    $ 101,751   39%    Combined hedges (a)  36,500   57,629   (21,129)   (37%)                 Total natural gas, NGLs and oil sales   $ 398,239    $ 317,617    $ 80,622   25%                (a) Cash settlements related to derivatives that qualify or were designated for hedge accounting.  Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production offset by the natural decline of our natural gas and oil wells and asset sales. For first quarter 2013, our production volumes increased 42% in our Appalachian region and decreased 6% in our Southwestern region when compared to the same period of 2012. Our production for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 is set forth in the following table:                                    Three Months Ended March 31,           2013   2012   Change  %                  Production (a)           Natural gas (mcf)  62,023,956   46,633,207   15,390,749   33%   NGLs (bbls)  1,889,424   1,560,826   328,598   21%   Crude oil (bbls)  912,662   608,077   304,585   50%   Total (mcfe) (b)  78,836,472   59,646,625   19,189,847   32%                   Average daily production (a)             Natural gas (mcf)  689,155   512,453   176,702   34%   NGLs (bbls)  20,994   17,152   3,842   22%   Crude oil (bbls)  10,141   6,682   3,459   52%   Total (mcfe) (b)  875,961   655,457   220,504   34% (a) Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.  (b) Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas,   which is not necessarily indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.  Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) received during first quarter 2013 was $4.26 per mcfe compared to $4.51 per mcfe in the same period of 2012. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the total impact of transportation, gathering and compression expense. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs) calculation also includes all cash settlements for derivatives, whether or not they qualify for hedge accounting. Average sales prices (wellhead) do not include derivative settlements or third party     29      transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying statements of operations. Average sales prices (wellhead) do include transportation costs where we receive net revenue proceeds. Average realized price calculations for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 are shown below:                         Three Months Ended March 31,           2013  2012            Average Prices       Average sales prices (wellhead):       Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 3.50   $ 2.75   NGLs (per bbl)  35.76  49.01   Crude oil (per bbl)  84.46  91.14   Total (per mcfe) (a)  4.59  4.36   Average realized prices (including derivative settlements that qualify for hedge accounting):       Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 4.07   $ 3.98   NGLs (per bbl)  35.76  49.01   Crude oil (per bbl)  85.58  91.14   Total (per mcfe) (a)  5.05  5.32   Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements):       Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 4.09   $ 4.01   NGLs (per bbl)  35.29  46.20   Crude oil (per bbl)  85.46  83.54   Total (per mcfe) (a)  5.06  5.19   Average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by Range):       Natural gas (per mcf)   $ 3.14   $ 3.18   NGLs (per bbl)  33.61  44.71   Crude oil (per bbl)  85.46  83.54   Total (per mcfe) (a)  4.26  4.51   (a) Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas,   which is not indicative of the relationship of oil and natural gas prices.  Derivative fair value loss was $99.9 million in first quarter 2013 compared to a loss of $60.8 million in the same period of 2012. Our derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method whereby all realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these contracts are included in derivative fair value loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Mark-to-market accounting treatment results in volatility of our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenue. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. The increase in the mark-to-market loss in the first quarter March 31, 2013 is primarily due to the impact of discontinuing hedge accounting as of March 1, 2013. Hedge ineffectiveness, also included in derivative fair value loss, is associated with contracts that qualify for hedge accounting. The ineffective portion is calculated as the difference between the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the estimated change in future cash flows from the item being hedged. Effective March 1, 2013, we elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. After March 1, 2013, all realized and unrealized gains and losses will be recognized in earnings immediately as derivative contracts are settled or marked-to-market.  The following table presents information about the components of derivative fair value loss for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):                     30                   Three Months Ended March 31,           2013   2012             Change in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting (a)   $ (96,802)   $ (52,056)   Realized gain on settlements – natural gas (b) (c)  815   —    Realized loss on settlements – oil (b) (c)  (102)  (4,622)   Realized loss on settlements – NGLs (b) (c)  (895)  (4,392)   Hedge ineffectiveness – realized (c)  564   1,185    – unrealized (a)  (3,455)  (948)            Derivative fair value loss   $ (99,875)   $ (60,833)                 (a)  These amounts are unrealized and are not included in average realized price calculations.        (b)   These amounts represent realized gains and losses on settled derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting.        (c)  These settlements are included in average realized price calculations (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation costs paid by  Range).  Loss on the sale of assets was $166,000 in first quarter 2013 compared to a loss of $10.4 million in the same period of 2012. In the first three months 2012, we sold a seventy-five percent interest in an East Texas prospect which included a suspended exploratory well and unproved properties for proceeds of $8.6 million resulting in a pre-tax loss of $10.9 million.  Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue in first quarter 2013 was $21.0 million compared to $4.6 million in the same period of 2012. The first quarter 2013 includes loss from equity method investments of $80,000 and revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas of $21.1 million. The first quarter 2012 includes income from equity method investments of $316,000, revenue from marketing and the sale of brokered gas of $3.3 million and an insurance reimbursement.  We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.                               Three Months Ended March 31,            (per mcfe)     2013   2012   Change  % Change                  Direct operating expense   $ 0.38    $ 0.49    $ (0.11)   (22%)   Production and ad valorem tax expense  0.14   0.61   (0.47)   (77%)   General and administrative expense  1.07   0.65   0.42   65%    Interest expense  0.54   0.62   (0.08)   (13%)   Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense  1.46   1.68   (0.22)   (13%) Direct operating expense was $30.2 million in first quarter 2013 compared to $29.0 million in the same period of 2012. We experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and manage existing properties. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring well workovers and repair-related expenses. Even though our production volumes increased 32%, on an absolute basis, our spending for direct operating expenses for first quarter 2013 only increased 4% with an increase in the number of producing wells and higher utilities and stock-based compensation. We incurred $1.4 million of workover costs in first quarter 2013 compared to $1.5 million of workover costs in the same period of 2012.  On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expense in first quarter 2013 declined 22% from the same period of 2012, with the decrease consisting of lower water hauling and disposal costs, workover costs, equipment rental and well services. We expect to experience lower costs per mcfe as we increase production from our dry gas Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas somewhat offset by higher operating costs on our Marcellus Shale liquids-rich wells. Operating costs in the Mississippian play are higher on a per mcfe basis than the Marcellus Shale play. As production increases from the Mississippian play, our direct operating expenses per mcfe is expected to begin to increase.      31                                     Three Months Ended March 31,            (per mcfe)     2013   2012   Change  % Change                  Lease operating expense   $ 0.35    $ 0.45    $ (0.10)   (22%)   Workovers  0.02   0.03   (0.01)   (23%)   Stock-based compensation (non-cash)  0.01   0.01   —    — %                  Total direct operating expense   $ 0.38    $ 0.49    $ (0.11)   (22%)               Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee that was passed in 2012. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $4.2 million in third quarter 2013 compared to $6.4 million in the same period of 2012. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) decreased to $0.05 in first quarter 2013 compared to $0.11 in the same period of 2012 due to an increase in volumes not subject to production taxes. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” on unconventional natural gas and oil production which includes the Marcellus Shale. Included in first quarter 2013 is a $7.1 million impact fee ($0.09 per mcfe) compared to $6.2 million ($0.10 per mcfe) in the same period of the prior year. First quarter 2012 also includes a $24.0 million retroactive fee ($0.40 per mcfe) which covered all wells drilled prior to 2012.  General and administrative expense was $84.1 million in first quarter 2013 compared to $38.7 million for the same period of 2012. The 2013 increase of $45.3 million when compared to 2012 is primarily due to a legal contingency related to an Oklahoma lawsuit of $35.0 million, higher salary and benefit expenses of $4.1 million, an increase in stock-based compensation of $2.1 million and higher legal and office expenses, including information technology. We continue to incur higher wages which we consider necessary to remain competitive in the industry. Our number of general and administrative (“G&A”) employees increased 6% at March 31, 2013 when compared to March 31, 2012. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights granted to our G&A employees and directors as part of compensation. On a per mcfe basis, G&A expense increased 65% from first quarter 2012. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012:                               Three Months Ended March 31,            (per mcfe)     2013   2012   Change  % Change                  General and administrative   $ 0.50    $ 0.51    $ (0.01)   (2%)   Oklahoma legal contingency  0.44   —    0.44   — %    Stock-based compensation (non-cash)  0.13   0.14   (0.01)   (7%)                 Total general and administrative expenses   $ 1.07    $ 0.65    $ 0.42   65%                      32      Interest expense was $42.2 million for first quarter 2013 compared to $37.2 million for first quarter 2012. The following table presents information about interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):                      Three Months Ended March 31,           2013  2012            Bank credit facility   $ 4,904   $ 2,638   Subordinated notes  35,011  32,678   Amortization of deferred financing costs and other  2,295  1,889            Total interest expense   $ 42,210   $ 37,205           The increase in interest expense for first quarter 2013 from the same period of 2012 was primarily due to an increase in outstanding debt balances and higher interest rates. In March 2013, we issued $750.0 million of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2023. We used the proceeds to repay our outstanding bank credit facility. In March 2012, we issued $600.0 million of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2022. We used the proceeds to repay $350.0 million of our outstanding credit facility balance and for general corporate purposes. The 2013 and 2012 note issuances were undertaken to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and to give us greater liquidity for the near term. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for first quarter 2013 was $685.6 million compared to $253.2 million in the same period of 2012 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 2.1% in both first quarter 2013 and 2012.  Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) was $115.1 million in first quarter 2013 compared to $100.2 million in the same period of 2012. The increase in first quarter 2013 when compared to the same period of 2012 is due to a 13% decrease in depletion rates more than offset by a 32% increase in production. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $1.38 per mcfe in first quarter 2013 compared to $1.59 per mcfe in the same period of 2012. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year-end reserve report and other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. The following table summarizes DD&A expense per mcfe for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012:                                 Three Months Ended March 31,            (per mcfe)     2013   2012   Change  % Change                  Depletion and amortization   $ 1.38    $ 1.59    $ (0.21)   (13%)   Depreciation  0.05   0.06   (0.01)   (17%)   Accretion and other  0.03   0.03   —    — %                  Total DD&A expense   $ 1.46    $ 1.68    $ (0.22)   (13%)               Other Operating Expenses  Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, transportation, gathering and compression expense, brokered natural gas and marketing expense, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties and deferred compensation plan expenses. In first quarter 2013, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($661,000), brokered natural gas and marketing expense ($249,000), exploration expense ($1.1 million) and general and administrative expense ($10.3 million) for a total of $12.3 million. In first quarter 2012, stock-based compensation was a component of direct operating expense ($357,000), brokered natural gas and marketing expense ($453,000), exploration expense ($928,000) and general and administrative expense ($8.2 million) for a total of $9.9 million. Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock grants and SARs grants.      33      Transportation, gathering and compression expense was $62.4 million in first quarter 2013 compared to $40.8 million in the same period of 2012. These third party costs are higher than 2012 due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third party gathering and compression agreements. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third party transportation expenses paid by Range).  Brokered natural gas and marketing was $22.3 million in first quarter 2013 compared to $4.1 million in the same period of 2012. These costs are higher than 2012 primarily due to an increase in brokered volumes.  Exploration expense was $16.8 million in first quarter 2013 compared to $21.5 million in the same period of 2012. Exploration expense was lower in first quarter 2013 when compared to 2012 due to lower seismic costs, lower delay rentals and lower dry hole costs. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 (in thousands):                                 Three Months Ended March 31,           2013   2012   Change  % Change                  Seismic   $ 7,168    $ 10,672    $ (3,504)   (33%)   Delay rentals and other  5,050   5,703   (653)   (11%)   Personnel expense  3,651   3,504   147   4%    Stock-based compensation expense  1,070   928   142   15%    Dry hole expense  (159)   709   (868)   (122%)                 Total exploration expense   $ 16,780    $ 21,516    $ (4,736)   (22%)               Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $15.2 million in first quarter 2013 compared to $20.3 million in the same period of 2012. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the current price environment, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments will likely be recorded.  Deferred compensation plan expense was $42.4 million in first quarter 2013 compared to income of $7.8 million in the same period of 2012. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Our stock price increased from $62.83 at December 31, 2012 to $81.04 at March 31, 2013. In the same quarter of the prior year, our stock price decreased from $61.94 at December 31, 2011 to $58.14 at March 31, 2012.  Income tax benefit was $47.2 million in first quarter 2013 compared to $27.8 million in first quarter 2012. The decrease in income taxes in first quarter 2013 reflects a 76% decrease in income from operations when compared to the same period of 2012. For the first quarter, the effective tax rate was 38.4% in 2013 compared to 40.0% in 2012. The 2013 and 2012 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes, permanent differences and changes in our valuation allowances related to our deferred tax asset for future deferred compensation plan distributions to senior executives to the extent their estimated future compensation (including these distributions) would exceed the $1.0 million deductible limit provided under section 162 (m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 40% for the remainder of 2013.      34      Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and since our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. We sell a large portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of March 31, 2013, we have entered into hedging agreements covering 184.3 Bcfe for 2013, 173.9 Bcfe for 2014 and 39.1 Bcfe for 2015.  Net cash provided from operations in first quarter 2013 was $201.2 million compared to $156.0 million in the same period of 2012. Cash provided from continuing operations is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2012 to 2013 reflects a 32% increase in production partially offset by lower realized prices (a decline of 6%) and higher operating costs. As of March 31, 2013, we have hedged approximately 73% of our projected production for the remainder of 2013, with approximately 75% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first three months 2013 was a positive $35.8 million compared to positive $36.4 million for the same period of 2012.  Net cash used in investing activities from operations in first quarter 2013 was $241.0 million compared to $443.9 million in the same period of 2012.  During first quarter 2013, we:          •  spent $259.6 million on natural gas and oil property additions;         •  spent $8.8 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and         •  received proceeds from asset sales of $38.2 million. During first quarter 2012, we:          •  spent $376.9 million on natural gas and oil property additions;         •  spent $74.3 million on acreage primarily in the Marcellus Shale; and         •  received proceeds from asset sales of $9.9 million. Net cash provided from financing activities in first quarter 2013 was $39.7 million compared to $410.7 million in the same period of 2012. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings.  During first quarter 2013, we:          •  borrowed $368.0 million and repaid $1.1 billion under our bank credit facility; ending the quarter with a $47.0 million outstanding balance on our bank debt;         •  issued $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2023, at par, with net proceeds of approximately $738.8 million; and         •  spent $12.1 million related to debt issuance costs; and     •  recorded a decrease of $12.5 million in cash overdrafts.      35      During first quarter 2012, we:        •  borrowed $340.0 million and repaid $527.0 million under our bank credit facility, ending the period with no outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility;         •  issued $600.0 million principal amount of 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2022, at par, with net proceeds of approximately $589.5 million; and         •  spent $11.2 million related to debt issuance costs; and   recorded a increase of $13.0 million in cash overdrafts.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operations, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first quarter 2013, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2013, 2014 and 2015 to protect future cash flows. In March 2013, we issued $750.0 million of new 5.00% ten-year senior subordinated notes due 2023. On April 2, 2013, we called the $250.0 million outstanding principal amount of our 7.25% senior subordinated notes due 2018 which will be redeemed in May 2013.  During first three months 2013, our net cash provided from continuing operations of $201.2 million, proceeds from the sale of assets of $38.2 million, proceeds from the issuance of our 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2023 and borrowings under our bank credit facility were used to fund $269.5 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At March 31, 2013, we had $194,000 in cash and total assets of $6.9 billion.  Long-term debt at March 31, 2013 totaled $2.9 billion, including $47.0 million outstanding on our bank credit facility and $2.9 billion of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at March 31, 2013 was $1.6 billion. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. To the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A material drop in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of natural gas, NGLs and oil, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings, asset sales or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves.  Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance, the state of the worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the level of our working capital or outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.  Credit Arrangements  As of March 31, 2013, we maintained a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of February 18, 2016.     36      Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders semi-annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors but primarily on the lenders’ assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of two thirds of the lenders; increases to the borrowing base require 97% lender approval. On April 8, 2013, the facility amount on our bank credit facility was reaffirmed at $1.75 billion and our borrowing base was reaffirmed at $2.0 billion. Our current bank group is currently composed of twenty-eight financial institutions.  Our bank debt and our subordinated notes impose limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt and our subordinated notes). The debt agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2013.  Capital Requirements  Our primary capital requirements are for exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. During first quarter 2013, $396.9 million of capital was expended on drilling projects. Also in first quarter 2013, $9.4 million was expended on acquisitions of unproved acreage, primarily in the Marcellus Shale and in the horizontal Mississippian oil play. Our 2013 capital program, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be funded by net cash flow from operations, a debt offering, proceeds from asset sales and borrowings under our bank credit facility. Our capital expenditure budget for 2013 is currently set at $1.3 billion, excluding proved property acquisitions. To the extent capital requirements exceed internally generated cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and our committed capacity under our bank credit facility, then debt or equity may be issued in capital market transactions to fund these requirements. On February 26, 2013, we signed a definitive agreement to sell certain of our oil and gas properties in New Mexico and West Texas for a purchase price of $275.0 million. We closed on this divestiture on April 1, 2013. We monitor our capital expenditures on an ongoing basis, adjusting the amount up or down and also between our operating regions, depending on commodity prices, cash flow and projected returns. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt.  The forward-looking statements about our capital budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for natural gas and oil, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorists acts and the government or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.  Cash Dividend Payments  The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures and various other factors. On March 1, 2013, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of four cents per share ($6.5 million) on our common stock, which was paid on March 29, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2013.  Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation and gathering commitments. As of March 31, 2013, we do not have any capital leases. As of March 31, 2013, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of March 31, 2013, we had a total of $84.7 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.    Since December 31, 2012, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $692.0 million reduction to our outstanding bank credit facility balance, an issuance of $750.0 million of new 5.00% senior subordinated notes due 2023, adjustments to certain transportation and gathering contracts which increased these commitments $63.0 million over the next 10 years and an extension of hydraulic fracturing service commitments to take advantage of lower rates into 2014 for $24.0 million.      37      Hedging – Oil and Gas Prices  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives, as we typically utilize commodity swap and collar contracts to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. In 2011, we also entered into “sold” NGL derivative swap contracts for the natural gasoline component of NGLs and in 2012 we entered into “re-purchased” derivative swaps for the natural gasoline component of NGLs. In addition, in second quarter 2012, we entered into NGL derivative swap contracts for propane. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets.  At March 31, 2013, we had open swap contracts covering 77.7 Bcf of natural gas at prices averaging $3.71 per mcf, 4.5 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $94.62 per barrel, 1.8 million net barrels of NGLs (the C5 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $92.72 per barrel and 2.3 million barrels of NGLs (the C3 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $37.00 per barrel. We had collars covering 258.6 Bcf of natural gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $4.08 to $4.64 per mcf and 1.6 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $88.23 to $100.00 per barrel. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax loss of $593,000 at March 31, 2013. The contracts expire monthly through December 2015.  At March 31, 2013, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                           Period  Contract Type  Volume Hedged  Weighted Average Hedge Price                             Natural Gas            2013  Collars  280,000 Mmbtu/day  $ 4.59–$ 5.05   2014  Collars  402,500 Mmbtu/day  $ 3.81–$ 4.47   2015  Collars  95,000 Mmbtu/day  $ 4.06–$ 4.48   2013  Swaps  256,127 Mmbtu/day  $3.67   2014  Swaps  20,000 Mmbtu/day  $4.08                Crude Oil            2013  Collars  3,000 bbls/day  $ 90.60–$ 100.00   2014  Collars  2,000 bbls/day  $ 85.55–$ 100.00   2013  Swaps  5,829 bbls/day  $96.73   2014  Swaps  6,000 bbls/day  $94.54   2015  Swaps  2,000 bbls/day  $90.20                NGLs (Natural Gasoline)            2013  Sold Swaps  8,000 bbls/day  $89.64   2013  Re-purchased Swaps  1,500 bbls/day  $76.30                NGLs (Propane)            2013  Swaps  7,000 bbls/day  $36.38   2014  Swaps  1,000 bbls/day  $40.32 Interest Rates  At March 31, 2013, we had approximately $2.9 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.9%. Bank debt totaling $47.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 3.7% at March 31, 2013. The 30-day LIBOR rate on March 31, 2013 was 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on March 31, 2013 would cost us approximately $470,000 in additional annual interest expense.      38      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2013 to continue to be a function of supply and demand.      39         ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are US dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivatives instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Natural gas prices affect us more than oil prices because approximately 74% of our December 31, 2012 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2012 to March 31, 2013.  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives such as swaptions, knockouts or extendable swaps. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. At March 31, 2013, our derivatives program includes swaps (both purchased and sold NGL swaps) and collars. As of March 31, 2013, we had open swap contracts covering 77.7 Bcf of natural gas at prices averaging $3.71 per mcf, 4.5 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $94.62 per barrel, 1.8 million net barrels of NGLs (the C5 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $92.72 per barrel and 2.3 million barrels of NGLs (the C3 component of NGLs) at prices averaging $37.00 per barrel. We had collars covering 258.6 Bcf of natural gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $4.08 to $4.64 per mcf and 1.6 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $88.23 to $100.00 per barrel. These contracts expire monthly through December 2015. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of March 31, 2013, approximated a net unrealized pre-tax loss of $593,000.        40      At March 31, 2013, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding:                               Period  Contract Type  Volume Hedged  Weighted Average Hedge Price  Fair Market Value                           (in thousands)   Natural Gas           2013   Collars  280,000 Mmbtu/day   $  4.59–$ 5.05   $ 42,984    2014   Collars  402,500 Mmbtu/day   $  3.81–$ 4.47   $(13,459)   2015   Collars  95,000 Mmbtu/day   $ 4.06–$ 4.48   $(2,179)   2013   Swaps  256,127 Mmbtu/day   $ 3.57    $ (31,486)   2014   Swaps  20,000 Mmbtu/day   $4.08    $(1,133)                   Crude Oil           2013   Collars  3,000 bbls/day   $ 90.60–$ 100.00   $(413)   2014   Collars  2,000 bbls/day   $ 85.55–$ 100.00   $ 354    2013   Swaps  5,829 bbls/day   $ 96.73    $ 96    2014   Swaps  6,000 bbls/day   $ 94.54    $ 3,872    2015   Swaps  2,000 bbls/day   $90.20    $630                    NGLs (Natural Gasoline)           2013   Sold Swaps  8,000 bbls/day   $ 89.64    $ 3,552    2013   Re-purchased Swaps  1,500 bbls/day   $ 76.30    $ 4,759                    NGLs (Propane)           2013   Swaps  7,000 bbls/day   $ 36.38    $(8,114)   2014   Swaps  1,000 bbls/day   $40.32    $(56)   We expect our NGL production to continue to increase. In our Marcellus Shale operations, propane is a large product component of our NGL production and we believe NGL prices are somewhat seasonal. Therefore, the percentage of NGL prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional markets.  The relationship between the price of oil and the price of natural gas is at an unprecedented spread. Normally, natural gas liquids production is a by-product of natural gas production. Due to the current differences in prices, we and other producers may choose to sell natural gas at or below cost or otherwise dispose of natural gas to allow for the sale of only natural gas liquids.  Currently, because there is little demand, or facilities to supply the existing demand, for ethane in the Appalachian region, for our Appalachian production volumes, ethane remains in the natural gas stream. We currently have waivers from two transmission pipelines that allow us to leave ethane in the residue natural gas. We believe the limits are sufficient to cover our production through 2014. We have announced three ethane agreements where we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, which are expected to begin operations in mid to late 2013, early 2014 and early 2015. We cannot assure you that these facilities will become available. If we are not able to sell ethane, we may be required to curtail production which will adversely affect our revenues.  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. At times, we have entered into basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location (“basis”), relative quality and other factors; therefore, we have entered into basis swap agreements in the past that effectively     41      fix the basis adjustments. We currently have no financial basis swap agreements outstanding.  The following table shows the fair value of our collars and swaps and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at March 31, 2013. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                                       Hypothetical Change in Fair Value  Hypothetical Change in Fair Value                  Increase of  Decrease of                Fair Value  10%  25%  10%  25%                     Collars   $ 27,287    $ (98,981)   $ (255,214)   $ 98,469    $ 254,770    Swaps  (27,880)  (97,671)  (244,260)  98,731   247,372  Our commodity-based contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with the majority of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At March 31, 2013, our derivative counterparties include fifteen financial institutions, of which all but two are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While counterparties are major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts have been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial.  Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At March 31, 2013, we had $2.9 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.9%. Bank debt totaling $47.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which was 3.7% on March 31, 2013. On March 31, 2013, the 30-day LIBOR rate was 0.2%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on March 31, 2013, would cost us approximately $470,000 in additional annual interest expense.        42              ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2013 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended March 31, 2013 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.        43      PART II – OTHER INFORMATION          ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   Litigation  James A. Drummond and Chris Parrish v. Range Resources-Midcontinent, LLC et al.; pending in the District Court of Grady County, State of Oklahoma; Case No. CJ-2010-510  Two individuals (one of whom is now deceased), only one of which was a current royalty owner, filed suit against Range Resources Corporation and two of our subsidiaries, including the proper defendant Range Resources-Midcontinent, LLC, in the District Court of Grady County, Oklahoma. This suit is similar to a number of cases filed in Oklahoma asserting claims that royalty owners are entitled to payment of royalties on several different categories of alleged “deductions” applied by third parties who transport and process natural gas production. The alleged deductions include fuel used by the third party in the transportation and processing of gas, condensate removed by the third party after the point of sale, the contractually agreed natural gas liquids recovery percentages, the percentage of proceeds contracts’ contractually agreed pricing percentages and other similar alleged “deductions.” In addition to the claims made with respect to the alleged categories of deductions, the Plaintiffs in this litigation have alleged fraud and the existence of a fiduciary duty to the royalty owners to attempt to support an argument that no statute of limitations applies, and the Plaintiffs also claim that interest accrues on the alleged damages at 12% compounded annually. Thus while we cannot reasonably estimate our potential exposure at this time, the damages claimed by the Plaintiffs have been estimated by the Plaintiffs’ counsel to be in excess of $140 million. We believe Oklahoma is a “first marketable product” rule state and the current case law in Oklahoma (principally Mittelstaedt v. Santa Fe) allows operators to deduct value enhancing costs for treating, compression and other post-production expenses incurred to increase the value of a marketable product; however, whether and when gas is a marketable product and the extent to which the deductions are permitted may be fact questions under Oklahoma law. Further, we do not typically transport and process the gas production from wells we operate in Oklahoma but instead sell the gas production to unaffiliated third parties which, in many cases, do transport and process the gas. Range maintains that the alleged “deductions” made the subject of the Plaintiffs’ claims are not deductions at all but the negotiated terms of the contracts with the third parties who buy, transport and process the gas under terms that allow Range and its royalty owners to share in the enhanced downstream value that establishes the purchase price for the production sold by us, and on which we have paid royalty. Range further believes that its production is marketable under Oklahoma law when sold to such unaffiliated third parties. The terms with respect to payment of royalties vary based on the terms of the various oil and gas leases owned by Range for its Oklahoma wells and wells it has owned and operated in Oklahoma in the past, and our subsidiary believes that it has substantially complied with its royalty payment obligations under its leases and we therefore intend to vigorously defend this litigation. As previously disclosed, on February 19, 2013, the District Court entered an order certifying a class of royalty owners as requested by the Plaintiffs. We have appealed the class certification order. In addition, we have received a revised claim of damages by the Plaintiffs which has increased the amount claimed by the Plaintiffs to $160.0 million. We have evaluated the possible financial impact of this litigation, and while we believe we have strong defenses to the claims made in this lawsuit, given our evaluation of the law in Oklahoma, the outcomes in other similar litigation and our assessment of the current status of the litigation, the three months ended March 31, 2013 includes an accrual of $35.0 million which, at this time, we believe is appropriate given the information available at this time. We may accrue additional amounts in the future or otherwise adjust this accrual depending upon future developments in the course of this litigation.  We are the subject of, or party to, a number of other pending or threatened legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, we believe that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to proceedings or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position as a whole or on our liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. We will continue to evaluate our litigation quarterly and will establish and adjust any litigation reserves as appropriate to reflect our assessment of the then current status of litigation.          ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described under Item 1A. Risk Factors filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.        44              ITEM 6.  EXHIBITS
