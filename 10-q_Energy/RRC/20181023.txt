Item 1A. Risk Factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Capital Resources and Liquidity  Cash Flow  Cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operations are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and because our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has varied and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. Production receipts, however, often lag payments to the counterparties. As of September 30, 2018, we have entered into derivative agreements covering 148.1 Bcfe for the remainder of 2018, 356.2 Bcfe for 2019 and 7.0 Bcfe for 2020, not including our basis swaps. 42  The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):                   Nine Months Ended September 30,              2018           2017       Sources of cash and cash equivalents                         Operating activities  $  774,947        $  600,532       Disposal of assets     24,339           27,583       Borrowing on credit facility     1,602,000           1,486,000       Other     45,824           38,825       Total sources of cash and cash equivalents  $  2,447,110        $  2,152,940                                 Uses of cash and cash equivalents                         Additions to natural gas and oil properties  $  (781,554  )     $  (771,067  )    Repayment on credit facility     (1,547,000  )        (1,282,000  )    Repayment of senior notes     —           (500  )    Acreage purchases     (50,461  )        (46,967  )    Additions to field service assets     (1,230  )        (4,687  )    Dividends paid     (14,950  )        (14,876  )    Debt issuance costs     (8,257  )        (247  )    Other     (43,749  )        (32,381  )    Total uses of cash and cash equivalents  $  (2,447,201  )     $  (2,152,725  )   Net cash provided from operating activities in first nine months 2018 was $774.9 million compared to $600.5 million in first nine months 2017. Cash provided from operating activities is largely dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes, net of the effects of settlement of our derivative contracts. The increase in cash provided from operating activities from 2017 to 2018 reflects a 14% increase in production and higher net realized prices (an increase of 6%) somewhat offset by higher operating costs. As of September 30, 2018, we have hedged more than 75% of our projected total production for the remainder of 2018, with more than 80% of our projected natural gas production hedged. Net cash provided from continuing operations is affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for first nine months 2018 were negative $20.3 million compared to negative $10.0 million for first nine months 2017.  Disposal of assets in first nine months 2018 includes $23.3 million of proceeds received from the sale of our Northern Oklahoma properties which closed in July 2018. In first nine months 2017, disposal of assets included $26.0 million of proceeds received from the sale of certain Western Oklahoma properties which closed in February 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operating activities, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, access to the debt and equity capital markets and asset sales. We must find new reserves and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. We continue to take steps to ensure we have adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program. In first nine months 2018, we entered into additional commodity derivative contracts for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 to protect future cash flows. Effective April 13, 2018, we entered into an amended and restated revolving bank credit facility, which expires in April 2023, with terms that were similar to our previous bank credit facility. During first nine months 2018, our net cash provided from operating activities of $774.9 million and borrowings under our bank credit facility were used to fund approximately $833.2 million of capital expenditures (including acreage acquisitions). At September 30, 2018, we had $357,000 in cash and total assets of $11.9 billion.  Long-term debt at September 30, 2018 totaled $4.2 billion, including $1.3 billion outstanding on our bank credit facility, $2.9 billion of senior notes and $49.0 million of senior subordinated notes. Our available committed borrowing capacity at September 30, 2018 was $452.6 million, with an additional $1.0 billion in borrowing base capacity available for increased liquidity potential. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves that are typical in the oil and natural gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives contracts currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. While our expectation is to operate within our internally generated cash flow, to the extent our capital requirements exceed our  43  internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity securities may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas business. A material decline in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, meet financial obligations and operate profitably. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year, taking into account various factors including the commodity price environment. Our 2018 capital budget is currently $941.2 million.  Commodity prices have remained volatile but have improved during 2018 compared to fourth quarter 2017. We have adjusted and must continue to adjust our business through efficiencies and cost reductions to compete in the current price environment which also requires reductions in overall debt levels over time. We plan to continue to work towards profitable growth within cash flows. We would expect to monitor the market and look for opportunities to refinance or reduce debt based on market conditions. We believe we are well-positioned to manage the challenges presented in a low commodity price environment and that we can endure continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by:        •  exercising discipline in our capital program with the expectation of funding our capital expenditures with operating cash flow and, if required, with borrowings under our bank credit facility;           •  continuing to optimize our drilling, completion and operational efficiencies; and           •  continuing to manage price risk by hedging our production volumes.    Credit Arrangements  As of September 30, 2018, we maintained a revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of $2.0 billion, which we refer to as our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility, during a non-investment grade period, is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of April 13, 2023. See Note 9 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our bank debt. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. Availability under the bank credit facility, during an investment grade period, is limited to aggregate lender commitments. As of September 30, 2018, the outstanding balance under our credit facility was $1.3 billion. Additionally, we had $281.4 million of undrawn letters of credit leaving $452.6 million of committed borrowing capacity available under the facility at the end of third quarter 2018, with an additional $1.0 billion in borrowing base capacity for potential increases in lender commitments. Our bank credit facility imposes limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under our bank credit facility). The bank credit facility also contains customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, investments and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2018. See Note 9 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our bank debt. Cash Dividend Payments  On August 31, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of two cents per share ($5.0 million) on our outstanding common stock, which was paid on September 28, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 14, 2018. The amount of future dividends is subject to discretionary declaration by the Board of Directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures, debt covenants and various other factors.  Cash Contractual Obligations  Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations and transportation, processing and gathering commitments. As of September 30, 2018, we do not have any capital leases. As of September 30, 2018, we do not have any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of September 30, 2018, we had a total of $281.4 million of undrawn letters of credit under our bank credit facility.  Since December 31, 2017, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations other than a $55.0 million increase in our outstanding bank credit facility balance, a new pipeline brought into service in Pennsylvania and pricing changes for current contracts. Our contractual obligations for firm transportation and gathering contracts increased by approximately $2.4 billion over the next twenty years related to these changes. Interest Rates  At September 30, 2018, we had approximately $4.2 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bore interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $1.3 billion bears interest at floating rates, which was 3.9% at September 30, 2018. The 30-day LIBOR Rate on September 30, 2018 was approximately 2.3%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2018 would cost us approximately $12.7 million in additional annual interest expense.  44  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not currently utilize any significant off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position, or for any other purpose. However, as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we have various contractual work commitments, some of which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  Inflation and Changes in Prices  Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs for the remainder of 2018 to continue to be a function of supply.  Certain New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The effects of certain new accounting standards that have not been adopted yet are discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.       ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term “market risk” refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market-risk exposure. All of our market-risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are U.S. dollar denominated.  Market Risk  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices. We employ various strategies, including the use of commodity derivative instruments, to manage the risks related to these price fluctuations. These derivative instruments apply to a varying portion of our production and provide only partial price protection. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines. Further, if our counterparties defaulted, this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the derivatives. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American natural gas production. Natural gas and oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Changes in natural gas prices affect us more than changes in oil prices because approximately 67% of our December 31, 2017 proved reserves are natural gas. We are also exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates. These risks did not change materially from December 31, 2017 to September 30, 2018.  45  Commodity Price Risk  We use commodity-based derivative contracts to manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. At times, certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program can also include collars, which establish a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. We have also entered into natural gas derivative instruments containing a fixed price swap and a sold option (referred to as a swaption in the table below). At September 30, 2018, our derivative program includes swaps, calls, collars and swaptions. The fair value of these contracts, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of September 30, 2018, approximated a net unrealized pretax loss of $104.8 million. These contracts expire monthly through December 2020. At September 30, 2018, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding, excluding our basis swaps which are discussed below:          Period     Contract Type     Volume Hedged        Weighted Average Hedge Price     Fair Market Value    Natural Gas                          (in thousands)    2018     Swaps      1,193,370 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.96     $  (8,430)    2019     Swaps     594,589 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.82     $  4,902    2018     Calls     70,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.10 (1)     $  (504)    2018     Swaptions     160,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 3.07 (2)     $  (4,900)    2019     Swaptions     298,014 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.86 (2)     $  8,681    2020     Swaptions     10,000 Mmbtu/day        $ 2.75 (2)     $  353                                       Crude Oil                                  2018     Swaps     8,500 bbls/day        $ 53.20     $  (15,163)    2019     Swaps     7,000 bbls/day        $ 55.26     $  (39,055)    2020     Swaps     1,500 bbls/day        $ 60.63     $  (3,205)    2019     Collars     1,000 bbls/day        $ 63.00 − $ 73.03     $  (717)                                       NGLs (C3-Propane)                                  2018     Swaps     11,668 bbls/day        $ 0.74/gallon     $  (16,767)    January – June 2019     Swaps     7,500 bbls/day        $ 0.92/gallon     $  (3,593)    2018     Collars     5,000 bbls/day        $ 0.95 − $ 1.04     $  (1,499)    January – March 2019     Collars     6,500 bbls/day        $ 0.92 − $ 1.02     $  (1,738)                                       NGLs (NC4-Normal Butane)                                  2018     Swaps     5,500 bbls/day        $ 0.91/gallon     $  (8,145)    January – March 2019     Swaps     2,250 bbls/day        $ 1.22/gallon     $  (78)                                       NGLs (C5-Natural Gasoline)                                  2018     Swaps     5,402 bbls/day        $ 1.24/gallon     $  (8,290)    2019     Swaps     2,178 bbls/day        $ 1.42/gallon     $  (6,647)       (1)  Weighted average deferred premium of $0.16.     (2)  Contains a combined derivative instrument consisting of a fixed price swap and a sold option to extend or double the volume. For October through December of 2018 we have swaps in place for 160,000 Mmbtu per day on which the counterparty can elect to extend the contract through December 2019 at a weighted average price of $3.07. We have swaps in place for 2019 for 185,000 Mmbtu/day on which the counterparty can elect to double the volume at a weighted average price of $2.89. We also have swaps in place for 2019 for 150,000 Mmbtu per day on which the counterparty can elect to extend the contract through December 2020 at a weighted average price of $2.81. For 2020, we have swaps in place for 10,000 Mmbtu/day on which the counterparty can elect to double the volume at a weighted average price of $2.75. In the future, we expect our NGLs production to continue to increase. We believe NGLs prices are somewhat seasonal, particularly for propane. Therefore, the relationship of NGLs prices to NYMEX WTI (or West Texas Intermediate) will vary due to product components, seasonality and geographic supply and demand. We sell NGLs in several regional and international markets. If we are not able to sell or store NGLs, we may be required to curtail production or shift our drilling activities to dry gas areas. Currently, the Appalachian region has limited local demand and infrastructure to accommodate ethane. We have previously announced agreements wherein we have contracted to either sell or transport ethane from our Marcellus Shale area, two of which began operations in late 2013. Our Mariner East transportation agreement and our terminal/storage arrangements at Sunoco’s Marcus Hook Industrial Complex facility near Philadelphia began ethane operations in early 2016. We cannot assure you that these facilities will remain available. If we are not able to sell ethane under at least one of these agreements, we may be required to curtail production or, as we have done in the past, purchase or divert natural gas to blend with our rich residue gas.  46  Other Commodity Risk  We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity price changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. Therefore, in addition to the swaps discussed above, we have entered into natural gas basis swap agreements. The price we receive for our gas production can be more or less than the NYMEX Henry Hub price because of basis adjustments, relative quality and other factors. Basis swap agreements effectively fix the basis adjustments. The fair value of the natural gas basis swaps was a loss of $1.3 million at September 30, 2018 and they settle monthly through September 2021. At September 30, 2018, we also had propane basis contracts which lock in the differential between Mont Belvieu and international propane indices. The contracts settle monthly through December 2019 and include a total volume of 1,943,000 barrels. The fair value of these contracts was a loss of $2.0 million on September 30, 2018. The following table shows the fair value of our swaps and basis swaps and the hypothetical changes in fair value that would result from a 10% and a 25% change in commodity prices at September 30, 2018. We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risks should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity (in thousands):                       Hypothetical Change in Fair Value        Hypothetical Change in Fair Value                         Increase of        Decrease of             Fair Value        10%        25%        10%        25%       Swaps     $  (104,471  )     $  (140,424  )     $  (351,057  )     $  141,359        $  355,408       Collars        (3,954  )        (6,094  )        (15,689  )        5,784           14,633       Swaptions        4,134           (53,839  )        (167,254  )        40,971           93,879       Calls        (504  )        (1,241  )        (3,954  )        366           487       Basis swaps        (3,296  )        (55  )        (58  )        26           75       Freight swaps        301           303           758           (303  )        (766  )   Our commodity-based derivative contracts expose us to the credit risk of non-performance by the counterparty to the contracts. Our exposure is diversified primarily among major investment grade financial institutions and we have master netting agreements with our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate derivative contracts. Our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty. At September 30, 2018, our derivative counterparties include twenty-one financial institutions, of which all but five are secured lenders in our bank credit facility. Counterparty credit risk is considered when determining the fair value of our derivative contracts. While our counterparties are primarily major investment grade financial institutions, the fair value of our derivative contracts has been adjusted to account for the risk of non-performance by certain of our counterparties, which was immaterial. Our propane sales from the Marcus Hook facility near Philadelphia are short-term and are to a single purchaser. Our ethane sales from Marcus Hook are to a single international customer bearing a credit rating similar to Range. Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to interest rate risk on our bank debt. We attempt to balance variable rate debt, fixed rate debt and debt maturities to manage interest costs, interest rate volatility and financing risk. This is accomplished through a mix of fixed rate senior and senior subordinated debt and variable rate bank debt. At September 30, 2018, we had $4.2 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.9 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $1.3 billion bears interest at floating rates, which was 3.9% on September 30, 2018. On September 30, 2018, the 30-day LIBOR Rate was approximately 2.3%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding on September 30, 2018, would cost us approximately $12.7 million in additional annual interest expense.  47      ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon the evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2018 at the reasonable assurance level.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There was no change in our system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  PART II – OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Note 16 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements entitled “Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part I Item 1 above for a summary of our legal proceedings, such information being incorporated herein by reference.  Environmental Proceedings Our subsidiary, Range Resources – Appalachia, LLC, was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (“DEP”), in second quarter 2015, that it intends to assess a civil penalty under the Clean Streams Law and the 2012 Oil and Gas Act in connection with one well in Lycoming County. The DEP has directed us to prevent methane and other substances from escaping from this gas well into groundwater and a stream. We have considerable evidence that this well is not leaking and pre-drill testing of surrounding water wells showed the presence of methane in the water before commencement of our operations. While we intend to vigorously assert this position with the DEP, resolution of this matter may nonetheless result in monetary sanctions of more than $100,000.     ITEM 1A.
