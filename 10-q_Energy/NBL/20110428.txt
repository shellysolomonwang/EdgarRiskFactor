Part II. Other Information   Item 1. Legal Proceedings   See Item I. Financial Statements â€“ Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies.   Item 1A. Risk Factors   There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, other than the following:    Our operations require us to comply with a number of US and international laws and regulations, violations of which could result in substantial fines or sanctions and/or impair our ability to do business.   Our operations require us to comply with a wide variety of US and international laws and regulations, such as those involving anti-corruption, competition and antitrust, anti-boycott, export control and/or taxation.   For example, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws and regulations enacted or promulgated by countries pursuant to the 1997 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. The scope and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. The recently-enacted UK Bribery Act of 2010, which is scheduled to become effective in July 2011, is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to public and private sector corruption and contains no facilitating payments exception. Violations of any such laws or regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or sanctions. Actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation, be expensive to defend, and impair our ability to do business.   Mergers of businesses often require the approval of certain government or regulatory agencies and such approval could contain terms, conditions, or restrictions that would be detrimental to our business after a merger. US antitrust laws require waiting periods and even after completion of a merger, governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge a merger as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest. We have merged with or acquired other companies in the past. Prevention of a merger by antitrust laws could impair our ability to do business.           35      Table of Contents      Item 2.
