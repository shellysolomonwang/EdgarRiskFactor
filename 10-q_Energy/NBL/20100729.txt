Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our major projects at Galapagos and Gunflint in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico may be adversely affected by our partnership with BP Exploration & Production Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of BP America Inc.   We believe an increase in development costs or a six-month delay in drilling activities would not have a significant impact on the total cash flows we expect to derive from these deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. However, a moratorium lasting six months or longer could have an impact on some of our oilfield service and equipment providers, which could result in delays of delivery of essential items or the performance of services after the moratorium is lifted.   Long-term Impact – The longer the delay and disruption continue, the greater the impact will be on our business in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Further delay in drilling and completion activities due to an extension of the Federal Deepwater Moratorium beyond six months, difficulty or delay in implementing legislative or regulatory changes, or unavailability of drilling rigs, support vessels and equipment, or other oilfield services when activities are resumed at the end of the Moratorium, could result in postponing the startup of our Galapagos and Gunflint projects, which we had expected to contribute to production growth and cash flows during 2011 and 2015, respectively.         23      Table of Contents    Continued delay and disruption will also have a negative impact on our planned exploration program in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. A significant delay or cancellation of planned exploratory activities will reduce our longer term ability to replace reserves, resulting in a negative impact on production over time. To the extent current exploration activities are significantly delayed, a gap could occur in our future production late in the decade with a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. Although exploration activities may be delayed, our large Gulf of Mexico exploration acreage position is not currently at risk of impairment. A large portion of the acreage was acquired in 2008 - 2010 and the leases have significant minimum remaining terms. However, higher development and operating costs could ultimately impact the fair values of our properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.   Another long-term impact which we currently expect on our business is longer development cycle time, which is the length of time it takes for a project to progress from first discovery to first production. Longer cycle times result from additional regulatory reviews, slower permitting processes and oversight and could result in lower rates of return on our investments.   It is also possible that other countries, including those in which we currently operate, will respond to the Incident with legislative or regulatory changes affecting offshore drilling activities under their control.   Finally, the potential for removal of the liability cap for claims of damages from oil spills, and/or the enactment of onerous rules and regulations regarding activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico could significantly alter our industry. Such rules could effectively limit which companies can operate in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Small and medium-sized oil and gas companies might not be able to obtain insurance coverage at economically appropriate levels or meet financial responsibility requirements and would have to exit the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Potentially less attractive economics for exploration and development programs going forward will require companies remaining in the Gulf of Mexico to review their business models. We have drilled, and believe we can continue to drill, safely in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. However, exploration and production companies will be able to continue doing business in the area only to the extent it remains economically viable. See Risk and Insurance Program Update below.   Mitigating Activities   We are currently engaged in the following activities designed to mitigate the impacts of the Deepwater Horizon Incident and Federal Deepwater Moratorium:           ·   planning for resumption of our drilling operations when activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico recommences;              ·   engaging in discussions with our rig contractors and service providers about the best way to mitigate the impact of the Moratorium, including options for moving equipment or capabilities elsewhere and to ensure there is adequate capacity when activity resumes;              ·   considering a reallocation of near-term Gulf of Mexico drilling capital to other opportunities if disruption continues in order to ensure a delay in drilling will not create a gap in production growth going forward;              ·   monitoring legislative and regulatory developments;              ·   implementing new, more stringent operating and safety requirements to comply with new and anticipated regulations so that we are ready to move forward as soon as possible when activity resumes;              ·   continuing to manage our risks and operations such that the likelihood of a significant accident or spill is remote;              ·   working with BP to effectively resource and deliver projects on which they are a partner;              ·   monitoring the impact on the insurance industry and re-evaluating our risk and insurance program; and              ·   monitoring our credit exposure to companies involved in the Deepwater Horizon Incident and the impact of the Incident on their liquidity, credit ratings, availability of credit, and perhaps, depending on developments, solvency.      Delays and volatility are inherent in our business. We have maintained a capital structure approach which provides a strong liquidity position allowing us to manage during periods of uncertainty. We feel we are well-positioned to respond to, and/or adjust our activities as events unfold in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.   In addition, we have a deep and diverse international portfolio, and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico represents only one of our four core operating areas. Our other core areas include the US onshore, West Africa and Eastern Mediterranean, and these areas have provided, and continue to provide, numerous opportunities for us to allocate capital in an optimal way going forward. The longer the delay and disruption in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico continue, and pending the outcome of legislative and regulatory activities, the more likely it would be that we would find it necessary to redeploy capital in onshore US or international areas in order to maintain our exploration momentum and production growth. See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Structure/Financing Strategy below.         24      Table of Contents    Expenses Related to Federal Deepwater Moratorium   At the time the Federal Deepwater Moratorium was announced, we were under contract for two deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling rigs. We have taken a proactive and cooperative approach with our drilling contractors in order to avoid force majeure and to determine our options for managing the suspension, and eventual resumption, of drilling activities. The ENSCO 8501 rig remains under contract and will be used to perform activities currently allowed in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, including completion activities at the Santa Cruz well for which we received a permit in July 2010. We entered into an agreement to terminate the drilling contract for the Noble Clyde Boudreax rig for a fee of $26 million. This rig was in the process of drilling a sidetrack to the exploration well at the Deep Blue prospect. This rig contract termination expense is included in other operating (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Impact of Federal Deepwater Moratorium.   US Onshore, West Africa and Eastern Mediterranean Update   DJ Basin Asset Acquisition On March 1, 2010, we closed the acquisition of substantially all of the US Rockies upstream assets of Petro-Canada Resources (USA) Inc. and Suncor Energy (Natural Gas) America Inc. The transaction increases our presence in the Wattenberg field and further expands our opportunity in the DJ Basin. The acquisition added approximately 10 MBoepd to our daily production base and approximately 46 MMBoe of proved reserves. A majority of the reserves are within the Wattenberg field, where our largest onshore US asset is located.   Potential Sale of Onshore US Assets We have entered into an agreement to divest certain non-core properties in the Mid-Continent and Illinois Basin areas for a sales price of approximately $550 million. We expect the sale, which will be effective as of April 1, 2010, to close in third quarter 2010. The properties represent approximately 5.7 MBoepd of production and 29 MMBoe of reserves.    Exploration Program Continued investment in significant exploration remains a key component to our strategy. We are in the process of integrating recently-acquired 3-D seismic information for our properties offshore Cameroon, reprocessing seismic information on Blocks O and I offshore Equatorial Guinea, in preparation for future drilling programs, and moving forward on our plans to drill an exploration well at the Leviathan prospect offshore Israel later this year.    Major Development Projects During second quarter 2010, we continued to advance our major development projects at the Aseng oil field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, and the Tamar project, offshore Israel, toward first production on time and on budget. We continued development drilling at Aseng with two drilling rigs working and well completions scheduled for the third quarter 2010, and conversion work is ongoing for the FPSO vessel that will be used in the Aseng development. In addition, we are continuing FEED (front end engineering and design) work for the Alen project and recently submitted the Plan of Development to the government of Equatorial Guinea. In Israel, we are in the process of finalizing a development plan for Tamar and negotiating additional natural gas sales contracts.   Sales Volumes   On a BOE basis, sales volumes were higher second quarter 2010 as compared with second quarter 2009. Production was higher in the onshore US areas due to record production in the Wattenberg field primarily due to the recent acquisition of producing properties. In Equatorial Guinea, crude oil sales volumes were higher due to the timing of liftings, despite the planned shut-in of the Alba field for scheduled facility maintenance and repair. In Israel, there was an increase in demand for natural gas to produce electricity and a higher percentage of the demand was met by production from our properties. Despite downtime related to equipment modifications at the Dumbarton FPSO, there was an increase in volumes lifted in the North Sea, which also contributed to the overall increase. These increases were partially offset by the expected decrease in natural gas sales volumes in Equatorial Guinea due to the planned shut-in of the Alba field discussed above.   Commodity Price Changes and Hedging    Second quarter 2010 average realized crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices have increased significantly from second quarter 2009 due to strengthening commodities markets which are showing benefit from the global economic recovery. During second quarter 2010 we expanded our hedging program with additional basis swaps. We have hedged approximately 43% of our expected world-wide crude oil production and 68% of our expected domestic natural gas production for the remainder of 2010.        25      Table of Contents    OUTLOOK   Our expected crude oil, natural gas and NGL production for the remainder of 2010 may be impacted by several factors including:           ·   overall level and timing of capital expenditures which, dependent upon our drilling success and notwithstanding the other factors listed below, are expected to maintain our near-term production volumes (See 2010 Budget discussion below);            ·   impact of US onshore asset sale, expected to close third quarter 2010, which will reduce production by approximately 5.7 MBoepd;            ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas of our US operations and in the North Sea;            ·   impact of potential legislative and regulatory changes on deepwater Gulf of Mexico operating and safety standards due to the Deepwater Horizon Incident;            ·   variations in sales volumes of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea related to potential downtime at the methanol, LPG and/or LNG plants;            ·   Israeli demand for electricity which affects demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation, market growth and competing deliveries of natural gas from Egypt;            ·   variations in North Sea sales volumes due to potential FPSO downtime and timing of liftings;            ·   seasonal variations in rainfall in Ecuador that affect our natural gas-to-power project;            ·   potential hurricane-related volume curtailments in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas;            ·   potential winter storm-related volume curtailments in the Northern region of our US operations;            ·   potential pipeline and processing facility capacity constraints in the Rocky Mountains and deepwater Gulf of Mexico;            ·   potential volume curtailments in Ecuador due to unsettled economic and political environment;            ·   impact of asset purchases;            ·   timing of significant project completion and initial production; and            ·   impact of sales of non-core operating assets.      2010 Budget  We have updated our business plan for the remainder of 2010 to take into account the impact of the Federal Deepwater Moratorium on our planned deepwater Gulf of Mexico activities. Some uncertainty remains, such as the length of time the Moratorium will continue and whether or not certain activities can be performed on deepwater wells during the Moratorium. Some of our planned activities are being delayed. However, in some cases, we are able to continue with well completion work and non-drilling activities, such as topside work or pipeline installation, that allow us to keep our projects moving forward on schedule. The delay in spending caused by the Moratorium will have a positive effect on our short-term net cash flows.   Our total capital investment program for 2010 is now estimated at $2.2 billion, $300 million less than previously announced, with approximately 37% going toward major project investments, 17% for exploration and appraisal activities, and the remaining 46% for ongoing maintenance and near-term development opportunities. We have planned to spend about $832 million on major project investments, with the majority of capital directed toward the development of Galapagos in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Aseng offshore Equatorial Guinea and Tamar offshore Israel. We expect to spend approximately $380 million for exploration activities. The remainder of our budget is focused on liquid-rich and emerging opportunities onshore in the US, as well as near-term development projects in Israel, the North Sea and China.   Excluded from the budget discussed above is the $509 million total purchase price for the DJ Basin asset acquisition on March 1, 2010, as well as $251 million of non-cash capital expected to be accrued for the Aseng FPSO capital lease.   We have a diverse domestic and international portfolio as well as ample liquidity which allow us to engage in activities that mitigate the impact of the drilling moratorium. Numerous opportunities are available to us, and it is possible that we may reallocate capital to US onshore or international locations. We will continue to review our options as the legislative and regulatory response to the Deepwater Horizon Incident unfolds.   We expect that the remaining 2010 budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and/or other financing. We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the year based on drilling results, commodity prices, cash flows from operations, the full impact of the Federal Deepwater Moratorium and legislative response, and property acquisitions and divestitures. Our capital spending is integrated with our goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Structure/Financing Strategy, below.   Risk and Insurance Program Update  In accordance with industry practices, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Consistent with that profile, our insurance program is structured to provide us an economically appropriate level of financial protection from significant unfavorable losses resulting from damages to, or the loss of, physical assets or loss of human life, liability claims of third parties, and business interruption (loss of production) attributed to certain assets and including such occurrences as well blowouts and resulting oil spills. We maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice and we regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and revise our insurance program accordingly.         26      Table of Contents    We expect the future availability and cost of insurance to be impacted by the recent Deepwater Horizon Incident. Impacts could include: tighter underwriting standards, limitations on scope and amount of coverage, and higher premiums, and will depend, in part, on future changes in laws and regulations regarding exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills.   Recently, various Congressional committees have begun pursuing legislation to increase or remove liability caps for deepwater drilling. The current $75 million liability limit under the Oil Pollution Act is likely to be materially increased or lifted in its entirety. Such a requirement would ultimately require a company to maintain either an insurance coverage minimum or a significant financial position. The insurance market will be unlikely to provide meaningful coverage enhancements to address any significant increases in liability caps going forward. We anticipate that, at a minimum, less insurance coverage will be available and at a higher cost. If the liability cap is lifted in its entirety, the industry could become relatively un-insurable.   Although the root cause, or causes, of the Deepwater Horizon Incident are unclear at this time, we believe there is a high likelihood of regulatory and/or legislative changes that will impact operations in the Gulf of Mexico. We will continue to monitor the expected regulatory and legislative response and its impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile, and adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection, at an economically appropriate level, against disruption to our operations and cash flows.   In accordance with industry practice, well owners generally indemnify drilling rig contractors against certain risks, such as those arising from property and environmental losses, pollution from sources such as oil spills, or contamination resulting from well blowout or fire or other uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons. Most of our domestic and international drilling contracts contain such indemnification clauses. In addition, well owners typically assume all costs of well control in the event of an uncontrolled well. We currently carry insurance protection for our net share of any potential financial losses occurring as a result of events such as the Deepwater Horizon Incident. This protection consists of $250 million of well control, pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage and $251 million of additional pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage, which also covers third party personal injury and death. Consequently if we were to experience an accident similar to the Deepwater Horizon, our total coverage for cleanup and consequential damages would be $501 million for our net share, subject to reduction for claims related to well control and third party damages.   Deepwater drilling entails inherent risks. We have a robust risk assessment program that analyzes safety and environmental hazards and establishes procedures, work practices, training programs and equipment requirements, including monitoring and maintenance rules, for continuous improvement. We have a strong safety performance record and strive to manage our risks such that the likelihood of a significant accident or spill is remote. However, if an event occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   In addition to our insurance coverages related to operations in the Gulf of Mexico, in April 2010, we notified Oil Insurance Limited (OIL), a mutual insurance company of which we are a member, that we would elect to self insure our 2010 windstorm exposure. Due to recent reductions in windstorm coverage by OIL, we now believe it is commercially more reasonable to self insure against this particular risk. Recent abandonment activities on the Gulf of Mexico Shelf have significantly reduced our windstorm exposure as our remaining Gulf of Mexico assets are primarily subsea operations. However, we are now responsible for substantially all windstorm-related damages to these assets.         27      Table of Contents    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Revenues   Revenues were as follows:                    Increase (Decrease) from Prior Year         2010       2009          (millions)                      Three Months Ended June 30,                  Oil, Gas and NGL Sales    $ 710     $ 460       54 %   Income from Equity Method Investees      24       16       50 %   Other Revenues      17       15       13 %   Total    $ 751     $ 491       53 %                              Six Months Ended June 30,                      Oil, Gas and NGL Sales    $ 1,398     $ 866       61 %   Income from Equity Method Investees      50       27       85 %   Other Revenues      36       39       (8 %)   Total    $ 1,484     $ 932       59 %     Changes in revenues are discussed below.         28      Table of Contents    Oil, Gas and NGL Sales Average daily sales volumes and average realized sales prices were as follows:           Sales Volumes       Average Realized Sales Prices          Crude Oil & Condensate       Natural Gas       NGLs       Total       Crude Oil & Condensate       Natural Gas       NGLs          (MBpd)       (MMcfpd)       (MBpd)       (MBoepd) (1)       (Per Bbl)       (Per Mcf)       (Per Bbl)      Three Months Ended June 30, 2010                                          United States (2)      38       414       13       120     $ 75.00     $ 3.89     $ 39.37     Equatorial Guinea (3) (4)      16       224       -       54       76.10       0.27       -     Israel      -       121       -       20       -       4.33       -     North Sea      9       7       -       10       75.22       4.53       -     Ecuador (5)      -       27       -       4       -       -       -     China      4       -       -       4       76.05       -       -     Total Consolidated Operations      67       793       13       212       75.36       2.91       39.37     Equity Investees (6)      2       -       5       7       74.22       -       50.32     Total Operations      69       793       18       219     $ 75.33     $ 2.91     $ 42.52     Three Months Ended June 30, 2009                                                      United States (2)      37       394       10       112     $ 51.85     $ 3.09     $ 23.94     Equatorial Guinea (3) (4)      15       244       -       56       51.63       0.27       -     Israel      -       95       -       16       -       2.76       -     North Sea      6       5       -       7       56.57       5.20       -     Ecuador (5)      -       16       -       3       -       -       -     China      5       -       -       5       48.87       -       -     Total Consolidated Operations      63       754       10       199       52.05       2.13       23.94     Equity Investees (6)      2       -       6       7       56.12       -       30.12     Total Operations      65       754       16       206     $ 52.19     $ 2.13     $ 26.24     Six Months Ended June 30, 2010                                                            United States (2)      39       399       13       118     $ 74.39     $ 4.64     $ 42.12     Equatorial Guinea (3) (4)      12       209       -       47       75.16       0.27       -     Israel      -       104       -       17       -       4.28       -     North Sea      9       7       -       10       76.15       4.97       -     Ecuador (5)      -       28       -       5       -       -       -     China      4       -       -       4       74.24       -       -     Total Consolidated Operations      64       747       13       201       74.77       3.32       42.12     Equity Investees (6)      2       -       5       7       74.96       -       53.33     Total Operations      66       747       18       208     $ 74.77     $ 3.32     $ 45.11     Six Months Ended June 30, 2009                                                            United States (2)      36       403       10       113     $ 43.92     $ 3.52     $ 24.33     Equatorial Guinea (3) (4)      14       243       -       55       46.19       0.27       -     Israel      -       103       -       17       -       2.78       -     North Sea      7       5       -       8       50.81       6.72       -     Ecuador (5)      -       23       -       4       -       -       -     China      4       -       -       4       43.28       -       -     Total Consolidated Operations      61       777       10       201       45.17       2.39       24.33     Equity Investees (6)      2       -       6       7       50.38       -       28.38     Total Operations      63       777       16       208     $ 45.32     $ 2.39     $ 25.92           (1)   Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of oil equivalent.

(2)   Average realized crude oil and condensate prices reflect reductions of $1.35 per Bbl and $2.29 per Bbl for second quarter 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $1.34 per Bbl and $2.49 per Bbl for the first six months of 2010 and 2009, respectively, from hedging activities.      Average realized natural gas prices reflect an increase of $0.01 per Mcf for second quarter 2009 and a decrease of $0.01 per Mcf for the first six months of 2010, from hedging activities. The price increase/reduction resulted from hedge gains/losses that were previously deferred in AOCL. The average realized natural gas prices for the second quarter of 2010 and first six months of 2009 were not impacted by hedging activities, as the net deferred gains reclassified from AOCL were de minimis.       (3)   Average realized crude oil and condensate prices reflect a reduction of $5.33 per Bbl for second quarter 2009 and $6.11 per Bbl for the first six months of 2009 from hedging activities. The price reduction resulted from hedge losses that were previously deferred in AOCL. All hedge gains or losses relating to Equatorial Guinea production had been reclassified to revenues by December 31, 2009.          (4)   Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.          (5)   The natural gas-to-power project in Ecuador is 100% owned by our subsidiaries and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated for accounting purposes. Electricity sales are included in other revenues. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation.          (6)   Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea.

In addition, timing of liftings in Equatorial Guinea resulted in an increase in sales volumes for the second quarter of 2010 as compared with the second quarter of 2009. For the first six months of 2010 as compared with the first six months of 2009 sales volumes decreased due to the planned shut-in of the Alba field for scheduled facility maintenance and repair.   In the North Sea, equipment modifications at the Dumbarton FPSO required the field to be shut in for nearly two months during the second quarter 2010. Despite the downtime, total North Sea production was up as compared with the second quarter 2009 as the related upgrades were completed in late May 2010, bringing existing production and a second development well at Lochranza online.   Revenues from crude oil and condensate sales included deferred losses of $4 million and $15 million for second quarter 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $9 million and $32 million for the first six months of 2010 and 2009, respectively, reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges.   Natural gas sales – Revenues from natural gas sales increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2010 as compared with 2009 due to the following:           ·   an increase in US average realized prices due to increased demand resulting from the economic recovery;            ·   an increase in Israel average realized prices which are tied to the global liquid markets;            ·   ongoing development activities in the Wattenberg field area in the US;            ·   additional production of approximately 36 MMcfpd for the second quarter 2010 from the DJ Basin asset acquisition; and            ·   an increase in Israel sales volumes due to an increase in demand for our natural gas driven by increased electricity production due to warmer weather and lower levels of competitor natural gas imports from Egypt;     partially offset by          ·   a decrease in Equatorial Guinea sales volumes due to the planned shut-down of the Alba field for facilities maintenance and repair;            ·   a decrease in sales volumes due to the sidetrack of a Swordfish gas well into an oil zone after the gas zone began producing water; and            ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas.      Revenues from natural gas sales included deferred losses of $1 million for the first six months of 2010 reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges. Revenues for the second quarters of 2010 and 2009 and the first six months of 2009 included de minimis amounts reclassified from AOCL.   NGL sales – Most of our US NGL production is from the Wattenberg field and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. NGL sales revenues increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2010 as compared with 2009 due to an increase in sales volumes from the Wattenberg field and an increase in consolidated average realized prices which benefitted from increased demand resulting from the global economic recovery.   Income from Equity Method Investees We have a 45% interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC, which owns and operates a methanol plant and related facilities and a 28% interest in Alba Plant LLC, which owns and operates a liquefied petroleum gas processing plant. Both plants are located onshore in Equatorial Guinea. Equity method investments are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets, our share of earnings is reported as income from equity method investees in our consolidated statements of operations, and our share of dividends is reported within cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.   The increase in income from equity method investees for the second quarter and first six months of 2010 as compared with 2009 was due to an increase in average realized condensate, LPG and methanol prices from increased demand due to the global economic recovery. Condensate and LPG sales volumes and average realized prices are included in the average daily sales volumes and average realized sales prices table above. Methanol sales volumes and prices were as follows:         31      Table of Contents             Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,          2010       2009       2010       2009      Methanol Sales Volumes in MMgal      34       41       69       76     Methanol Sales Prices    $ 0.84     $ 0.49     $ 0.83     $ 0.47       The increase in dividends from equity method investees to $48 million for the first six months of 2010 as compared with $5 million for the first six months of 2009 was due to their increased profitability.

Oil and gas exploration expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2010 increased as compared with 2009. US dry hole expense was associated with the Double Mountain exploration well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which found noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. US seismic expense was incurred in support of Central Gulf of Mexico lease sales and West Africa seismic expenditures represented the acquisition of 3-D seismic information for Cameroon.         34      Table of Contents    Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD&A expense was as follows:           Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,          2010       2009       2010       2009      (millions, except unit rate)                            DD&A Expense    $ 210     $ 192     $ 422     $ 389     Accretion of Discount on Asset Retirement Obligations      5       4       9       7     Total DD&A Expense    $ 215     $ 196     $ 431     $ 396     Unit Rate per BOE (1)    $ 11.13     $ 10.88     $ 11.81     $ 10.95           (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.      Total DD&A expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2010 increased as compared with 2009 due to the following:           ·   higher production in the Wattenberg, Piceance and Western Oklahoma areas of our US operations, which have high DD&A rates relative to production from Equatorial Guinea and Israel which have lower DD&A rates;            ·   ongoing capital spending in the Northern region of our US operations;            ·   higher sales volumes in the North Sea; and            ·   impact of lower year-end 2009 commodity prices on oil and gas reserves;    partially offset by         ·   lower DD&A expense in the Mid-Continent area which has a reduced net book value resulting from an impairment recorded at the end of 2009; and            ·   the cessation of DD&A associated with assets held for sale.      The unit rate per BOE increased for the second quarter and first six months of 2010 as compared with 2009 due to the change in mix of production, including decreases in lower-cost sales volumes from Equatorial Guinea and the impact of lower year-end 2009 commodity prices on oil and gas reserves, offset by a lower rate for the Mid-Continent area and the cessation of DD&A associated with assets held for sale.   General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows:           Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,          2010       2009       2010       2009      G&A Expense (millions)    $ 63     $ 60     $ 129     $ 119     Unit Rate per BOE (1)    $ 3.26     $ 3.35     $ 3.54     $ 3.29           (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.      G&A expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2010 increased as compared with 2009 primarily due to additional expenses relating to personnel and office costs in support of our major projects.   Asset Impairments Asset impairment expense for the first six months of 2009 was related to Granite Wash, an onshore US area where we have significantly reduced investments beginning in 2007, and our Gulf of Mexico Main Pass asset which had been reclassified from held-for-sale to held-and-used.   Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net Other operating (income) expense, net includes rig contract termination expense related to the Federal Deepwater Moratorium, electricity generation expense and other items of operating income or expense. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Note 3. Impact of Federal Deepwater Moratorium.        35      Table of Contents    Other (Income) Expense   Other (income) expense was as follows:                    Increase (Decrease) from          2010       2009       Prior Year      (millions)                      Three Months Ended June 30,                  (Gain) Loss on Commodity Derivative Instruments    $  (96 )   $  139       N/M     Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized      19       23       (17 %)   Other Non-Operating (Income) Expense, Net      (13 )     4       N/M     Total    $  (90 )   $  166       N/M                                Six Months Ended June 30,                      (Gain) Loss on Commodity Derivative Instruments    $  (242 )   $  66       N/M     Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized      39       41       (5 %)   Other Non-Operating (Income) Expense, Net      (13 )     12       N/M     Total    $  (216 )   $  119       N/M        (N/M) The percentage is so large that it is not meaningful.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.   Interest Expense and Capitalized Interest Interest expense and capitalized interest were as follows:           Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,          2010       2009       2010       2009      (millions, except unit rate)                            Interest Expense    $ 35     $ 35     $ 70     $ 59     Capitalized Interest      (16 )     (12 )     (31 )     (18 )   Interest Expense, Net    $ 19     $ 23     $ 39     $ 41     Unit Rate, per BOE (1)    $ 0.99     $ 1.29     $ 1.06     $ 1.13           (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.      Interest expense increased for the first six months of 2010, as compared with 2009. The increase in interest expense primarily relates to our $1 billion 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019, which we issued on February 27, 2009. The higher rate on the senior unsecured notes replaced the substantially lower rate applicable to our revolving credit facility. See also Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities below.   The increases in the amount of interest capitalized are due to higher work in progress amounts related to major long-term projects in West Africa, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Israel and the higher interest rate associated with our $1 billion 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019.   Other Non-operating (Income) Expense, Net Other non-operating (income) expense, net includes deferred compensation (income) expense, interest income and other (income) expense. The decrease was due to a reduction in deferred compensation expense and increases in interest and other income. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation.   Income Tax Provision (Benefit)   See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 13. Income Taxes for a discussion of the change in our effective tax rate during the first six months of 2010 as compared with 2009.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Capital Structure/Financing Strategy We strive to employ a capital structure, emphasizing a strong balance sheet, and financing strategy designed to provide ample liquidity throughout the commodity price cycle, sufficient to fund growth and major project development. Specifically, we strive to retain the ability to fund long-cycle, capital intensive development projects while also maintaining the capability for financially attractive periodic mergers and acquisitions activity, such as the DJ Basin asset acquisition on March 1, 2010. We endeavor to maintain an investment grade debt rating in support of these objectives. We also utilize a commodity price hedging program to reduce commodity price uncertainty and enhance the predictability of cash flows along with a risk and insurance program to protect against disruption to our operations and cash flows. See Risk and Insurance Program Update, above.         36      Table of Contents    We have planned to spend approximately $1 billion per year in 2010 and 2011 for major project development with funding provided by cash flows from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and/or other financing. Cash may also be generated by occasional sales of non-strategic crude oil and natural gas properties.   As a result of the Federal Deepwater Moratorium, a portion of our spending related to exploratory and development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico may be delayed. Additional delays in spending could occur, if, at the end of the Moratorium, drilling rigs, support vessels and equipment, or other oilfield services are in short supply. A delay in spending will have a positive effect on our cash flows in the short term, to the extent we do not redeploy capital to US onshore or international areas. Once the Moratorium ends and we are re-engaged in our planned activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we may see a negative impact on cash flows due to higher drilling, operating and insurance costs.   Delays and price volatility are inherent in our business. Our capital structure approach has been to maintain a strong liquidity position which allows us to manage uncertainty by providing alternative courses of action. At June 30, 2010, we had over $1 billion in cash and significant remaining capacity under our credit facility for a total liquidity of $2.3 billion. This strong financial capacity will provide flexibility as we decide how best to manage the current situation in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.   Information regarding cash and debt balances was as follows:         June 30,       December 31,          2010       2009      (millions, except percentages)                Cash and Cash Equivalents    $ 1,017     $ 1,014     Amount Available to be Borrowed Under Credit Facility      1,280       1,718     Total Liquidity    $ 2,297     $ 2,732                        Total Debt (Excluding Unamortized Discount)    $ 2,591     $ 2,045     Total Shareholders' Equity      6,541       6,157     Debt-to-Capital Ratio (1)      28 %     25 %         (1)   We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes both long-term debt, excluding unamortized discount, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.      Cash and Cash Equivalents We had $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2010, primarily denominated in US dollars and invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. A majority of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries and most would be subject to US income taxes if repatriated. We currently intend to use our international cash to fund international projects, including the planned developments in Equatorial Guinea and Israel.   Credit Facility We have an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures December 9, 2012. The commitment is $2.1 billion until December 9, 2011 at which time the commitment reduces to $1.8 billion. We ended second quarter 2010 with $1.3 billion remaining available for borrowing.   Derivative Instruments  We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs. Such instruments include variable to fixed commodity price swaps, collars and basis swaps. Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. If actual commodity prices are higher than the fixed or ceiling prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be lower than if we had no derivative instruments. Conversely, if actual commodity prices are lower than the fixed or floor prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be higher than if we had no derivative instruments. Except for certain minor derivative contracts that we enter into from time to time in order to market third-party natural gas, none of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements. We also use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk by entering into forward contracts or swap agreements to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with fixed or floating rate borrowings.   Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of June 30, 2010 the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $122 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $5 million (after consideration of netting agreements). Interest rate derivative instruments, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense over the term of the related notes. As of June 30, 2010 the fair value of our interest rate derivative liability was $94 million. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for a discussion of counterparty credit risk and Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of derivative instruments.         37      Table of Contents    Cash Flows Cash flow information is as follows:         Six Months Ended June 30,          2010       2009      (millions)                Total Cash Provided By (Used in)                Operating Activities    $ 844     $ 498     Investing Activities      (1,248 )     (777 )   Financing Activities      407       95     Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents    $ 3     $ (184 )     Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2010 increased as compared with the first six months of 2009 due primarily to increases in commodity prices, the refund of deepwater Gulf of Mexico royalties and an increase in dividends received from equity method investees.   Investing Activities Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties, which may be offset by proceeds from property sales. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $471 million during the first six months of 2010 as compared with the first six months of 2009, primarily due to the DJ Basin asset acquisition. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures. See also Investing Activities – Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures below.   Financing Activities  Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first six months of 2010, $438 million of funds were provided by net increases in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and used to fund the DJ Basin asset acquisition and other capital expenditures. Funds were also provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($44 million). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($63 million) and to repurchase shares of our common stock ($12 million).   In comparison, during the first six months of 2009, funds were provided by net proceeds from the issuance of our 8¼% senior notes ($989 million) and cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($16 million). We used cash for net repayments of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility ($821 million), to pay dividends on our common stock ($63 million), and to repurchase shares of our common stock ($1 million).   Investing Activities Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures  Information for investing activities (on an accrual basis) is as follows:           Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,          2010       2009       2010       2009      (millions)                            Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures                            Unproved Property Acquisition    $ 62     $ 46     $ 208     $ 62     Proved Property Acquisition      -       -       363       -     Exploration      56       50       171       145     Development      363       198       637       429     Corporate and Other      38       29       58       73     Total    $ 519     $ 323     $ 1,437     $ 709     Increase in FPSO Lease Obligation    $ 68     $ -     $ 108     $ -       2010 Unproved property acquisition costs for the first six months of 2010 include $36 million of lease bonuses paid on deepwater Gulf of Mexico lease blocks and $146 million related to the DJ Basin asset acquisition and the remainder primarily for other onshore US lease acquisitions. Proved property acquisition costs are the result of the DJ Basin asset acquisition. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures.   The obligation under FPSO lease represents the increase in estimated construction in progress to date on an FPSO to be used in the development of the Aseng field in Equatorial Guinea. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Debt.   2009 Unproved property acquisition costs include primarily lease bonuses on deepwater Gulf of Mexico lease blocks.         38      Table of Contents    Financing Activities Long-Term Debt Our principal source of liquidity is an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures December 9, 2012. The commitment is $2.1 billion until December 9, 2011 at which time the commitment reduces to $1.8 billion. The credit facility (i) provides for credit facility fee rates that range from 5 basis points to 15 basis points per year depending upon our credit rating, (ii) makes available short-term loans up to an aggregate amount of $300 million and (iii) provides for interest rates that are based upon the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 20 basis points to 70 basis points depending upon our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility. The credit facility is with certain commercial lending institutions and is available for general corporate purposes.   At June 30, 2010, borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaled $820 million, leaving approximately $1.3 billion available for use. The weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility at June 30, 2010 was 0.66%.   Our outstanding fixed-rate debt totaled $1.6 billion at June 30, 2010. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 7.73%, with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2097.   Our ratio of debt-to-book capital was 28% at June 30, 2010 and 25% at December 31, 2009. We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes both long-term debt, excluding unamortized discount, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.   Short-Term Borrowings Our committed credit facility may be supplemented by short-term borrowings under various uncommitted credit lines used for working capital purposes. Uncommitted credit lines may be offered by certain banks from time to time at rates negotiated at the time of borrowing. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit lines at June 30, 2010 or December 31, 2009. Depending upon future credit market conditions, these sources may or may not be available. However, we are not dependent on them to fund our day-to-day operations.   Dividends We paid total cash dividends of 36 cents per share of our common stock during the first six months of each of 2010 and 2009. On July 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per common share, payable August 23, 2010 to shareholders of record on August 9, 2010. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.   Exercise of Stock Options We received cash proceeds of $28 million from the exercise of stock options during the first six months of 2010 as compared with $13 million during the first six months of 2009.   Common Stock Repurchases We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 163,388 shares with a value of $12 million during the first six months of 2010 and 17,510 shares with a value of $1 million during the first six months of 2009.          39      Table of Contents    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Commodity Price Risk Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.   At June 30, 2010, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps, collars and basis swaps related to crude oil and natural gas sales. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net receivable position with a fair value of $117 million. Based on the June 30, 2010 published commodity futures price strips for the underlying commodities, a hypothetical price increase of $1.00 per Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $10 million. A hypothetical price increase of $0.10 per MMBtu for natural gas would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $11 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.    Interest Rate Risk  Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.   At June 30, 2010, we had $2.5 billion (excluding the FPSO lease and unamortized discount) of long-term debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.6 billion was fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.73%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss.   The remainder of our long-term debt, $820 million at June 30, 2010, was variable-rate debt drawn under our credit facility. Variable-rate debt exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to increases in market interest rates. We estimate that a hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the June 30, 2010 balance of our variable-rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $2 million.   We occasionally enter into interest rate derivative instruments such as forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate derivative instruments used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At June 30, 2010, AOCL included $63 million, net of tax, related to interest rate derivative instruments. Of this amount, $2 million, net of tax, is currently being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of our 5¼% Senior Notes due April 2014. The remainder ($61 million, net of tax) is related to the change in fair value of an interest rate forward starting swap. Based on the notional amount subject to the interest rate forward starting swap at June 30, 2010, a hypothetical 10% increase in the implied 30-year forward starting swap rate would decrease the fair value of the interest rate derivative liability by approximately $33 million.   See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.   We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances. As of June 30, 2010, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1 billion, approximately 72% of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. A hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the amount invested as of June 30, 2010 would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately $2 million.    Foreign Currency Risk  The US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as foreign deferred tax liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, are denominated in a foreign currency. An increase in exchange rates between the US dollar and the currency of the foreign tax jurisdiction in which these liabilities are located could result in the use of additional cash to settle these liabilities. Transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and are included in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.   In the UK sector of our North Sea operations, significant future capital commitments and certain operating expenses are expected to be denominated in British pounds. Therefore, our cash flows could be impacted by future changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound. We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determined that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.         40      Table of Contents    Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:           ·   our growth strategies;            ·   our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;            ·   anticipated trends in our business;            ·   our future results of operations;            ·   our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;            ·   market conditions in the oil and gas industry;            ·   our ability to make and integrate acquisitions; and            ·   the impact of governmental regulation.      Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under Item 1A.

Controls and Procedures   Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Risk Factors   There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 or our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, other than the following:   Our operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as well as in U.S. onshore and international locations, could be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations which are expected to occur as a result of the Deepwater Horizon Incident.   In April 2010, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling rig Deepwater Horizon was engaged in drilling operations for another operator and sank after an apparent blowout and fire. The accident resulted in the loss of life and a significant oil spill. On May 27, 2010, in response to the Incident, the President of the United States announced a six-month moratorium on drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and imposed new restrictions on permitting activities on the Outer Continental Shelf. In conjunction therewith, the Department of the Interior issued a directive calling for additional safety and performance standards as well as rigorous monitoring and testing requirements. More recently, various Congressional committees have begun pursuing legislation to regulate drilling activities and increase liability. The legislature and regulatory response may not be limited to the U.S.; other countries could respond to the Incident as well.   We are monitoring legislative and regulatory developments; however, the full legislative and regulatory response to the Incident is not yet known. An expansion of safety and performance regulations or an increase in liability for drilling activities may have one or more of the following impacts on our business:         41      Table of Contents         ·   increase the costs of drilling exploratory and development wells;            ·   cause delays in, or preclude, the development of our projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico or other locations;            ·   result in higher operating costs;            ·   increase or remove liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills;            ·   limit our ability to obtain additional insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms to protect against any increase in liability.       Any of the above factors may result in a reduction of our cash flows, profitability, and the fair value of our properties.   Our major projects at Galapagos and Gunflint in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico may be adversely affected by our partnership with BP Exploration & Production Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of BP America Inc.   We are partners with BP at two major development projects in the deepwater Gulf Mexico, Galapagos and Gunflint. At Galapagos, we are the operator for the Santa Cruz and Santiago wells, and BP is the operator for the Isabela well. At Gunflint, we are the operator. Each project requires significant capital investments.   As a result of BP’s involvement in the Deepwater Horizon Incident, its ability to participate effectively as a partner in the Galapagos and Gunflint projects may be negatively impacted. For example, manpower and material resources have been diverted to addressing the Incident and resultant cleanup. Further, BP’s credit rating has recently been downgraded. In addition, its assets could be encumbered by governmental agencies, and/or its operating and development activities could be subject to heightened regulatory review or a reduction in scope. BP may have to sell assets or reduce capital expenditures in order to satisfy its oil-spill claims. These actions could limit BP’s liquidity and financial flexibility and leave it unable to fund its share of project costs on a timely basis. As a result, these projects could become subject to increased costs and/or delays which could decrease our cash flows and profitability.   Derivatives regulation included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.   In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress and signed into law. The Act contains significant derivatives regulation, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as “margin”) for such transactions. The Act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions. The Act requires the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission (the CFTC) to promulgate rules to define these terms, but we do not know the definitions that the CFTC will actually promulgate nor how these definitions will apply to us.   We use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected production in order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and enhance the predictability of cash flows relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas. We also use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with anticipated debt issuances. As commodity prices increase or interest rates decrease, our derivative liability positions increase; however, none of our current derivative contracts require the posting of margin or similar cash collateral when there are changes in the underlying commodity prices or interest rates that are referred to in these contracts.   Depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC, we could be required to post collateral with our dealer counterparties for our commodities and interest rate derivative transactions. Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral would cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or would require us to increase our level of debt. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral would likely result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of our hedges and our profitability.   Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal regimes of the countries in which we operate.   We operate in the US and other countries whose tax and fiscal regimes may change over time. The application of fiscal regimes through laws and regulations governing royalty payments and/or income taxes results in an increase or decrease in the amount of revenues a government collects, and a corresponding decrease or increase in the revenues of an oil and gas company operating in that particular country.   Historically, royalty and income tax laws and regulations have changed in certain jurisdictions, and the implementation of new, or the modification of existing, laws or regulations could negatively impact our operations. For example, the UK Finance Act of 2006 increased the income tax rate on our UK operations effective January 1, 2006. The China Petroleum Special Profits Tax, enacted in 2006, imposed an excise tax on crude oil produced in the country.         42      Table of Contents    The proposed US federal budget for fiscal year 2011, as originally submitted, as well as other proposed legislation currently before Congress, included provisions which could effectively raise taxes for US oil and gas operations.   In Israel, the finance ministry recently announced the establishment of a committee to study Israel’s tax policy for the upstream oil and natural gas sector, as well as various options, including an increase in taxes and royalties.   Tax policy changes could result in increases in royalties or other taxes. If these or similar proposals are enacted, our taxes will increase, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. This could also reduce our drilling activities. Since none of these proposals have yet to become law, we do not know the ultimate impact they may have on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Our operations require us to comply with a number of US and international laws and regulations, violations of which could result in substantial fines or sanctions and impair our ability to do business.   Our operations require us to comply with a number of US and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-corruption. For example, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws and regulations enacted or promulgated by countries pursuant to the 1997 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Anti-Bribery Convention generally prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. The scope and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. The recently-enacted UK Bribery Act of 2010, which becomes effective in 2011, is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to public and private sector corruption and contains no facilitating payments exception. Violations of such laws or regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or sanctions, and actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and impair our ability to do business.
