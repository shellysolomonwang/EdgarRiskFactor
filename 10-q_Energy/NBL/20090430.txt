Item 1A. Risk Factors), significant decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices could result in a reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. The commodity price decreases that began during the second half of 2008 required us to record asset impairment charges during fourth quarter 2008. Further declines in natural gas prices during first quarter 2009 led us to review those properties that, at year-end 2008, were susceptible to impairment should commodity prices continue to decline appreciably. As a result of this review, we determined that additional properties were impaired as of March 31, 2009. Total pre-tax (non-cash) impairments for first quarter 2009 were $437 million and were predominately related to Granite Wash, an onshore US area in which we have significantly reduced investments beginning in 2007. The decrease in the natural gas futures price strip that occurred during first quarter 2009 was the primary factor that required an impairment of Granite Wash. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements. Further declines in commodity prices could result in additional impairment of our oil and gas properties, other long-lived assets or goodwill.    Continued lower commodity prices will reduce our cash flows from operations. To mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices on our cash flows, we have entered into crude oil commodity contracts for 2009 and 2010 and natural gas commodity contracts for 2009, 2010 and 2011. Depending on the length of the current recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing a prolonged downturn, which would further reduce our cash flows from operations. This could cause us to alter our business plans including reducing or delaying our exploration and development program spending and other cost reduction initiatives. See 2009 Budget below.   We are closely monitoring costs and have implemented several cost savings initiatives, including continued reduction of well costs through drilling and completion efficiencies and comprehensive review of oil and gas operating costs. We are also beginning to see reductions in third party drilling costs and operating supplies and services.           21            OUTLOOK   Our expected crude oil, natural gas and NGL production for the remainder of 2009 may be impacted by several factors including:           ·   overall level and timing of capital expenditures, as discussed below, which, dependent upon our drilling success, are expected to result in near-term production growth;             ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-continent areas of our US operations and the North Sea;             ·   higher sales of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea;             ·   potential hurricane-related volume curtailments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas of our US operations as occurred with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008;             ·   the restoration of pipeline and facilities necessary to increase our Gulf of Mexico production;             ·   potential winter storm-related volume curtailments in the Northern region of our US operations;             ·   potential pipeline and processing facility capacity constraints in the Rocky Mountains area of our US operations and timing of start-up of a new interstate crude oil transportation pipeline system which will run from Weld County, Colorado to Cushing, Oklahoma;             ·   growth in demand for natural gas in Israel;             ·   Israeli seasonal demand;             ·   competing natural gas deliveries in Israel from Egypt, which could lower our sales volumes;             ·   potential downtime at the methanol, LPG and/or LNG plants in Equatorial Guinea;             ·   seasonal variations in rainfall in Ecuador that affect our natural gas-to-power project; and             ·   timing of significant project completion and initial production.      2009 Budget – Due to the uncertain economic and commodity price environment, we have designed a flexible capital spending program that will be responsive to conditions that develop during 2009. Our revised capital program for 2009 accommodates an investment level of $1.6 billion, with the ability to adjust up or down by approximately 15%. Currently we are managing towards an investment level of $1.4 billion, the lower end of this range.    Approximately 40% of the 2009 budget is committed to longer-term projects that will provide considerable production growth several years in the future. The remainder is allocated toward maintaining and strengthening the existing property base. Development spending will focus on our international and deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets as well as certain higher return opportunities onshore in the US including the Wattenberg field. The exploration budget will center on significant resource potential in Israel, West Africa and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. International expenditures are estimated to represent 30% of the total capital program.   The 2009 budget does not include the impact of possible asset purchases. We expect that the remaining 2009 budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the remainder of the year based on drilling results, commodity prices, cash flows from operations and property acquisitions and divestitures.

Average realized natural gas prices reflect a reduction of $0.01 for first quarter 2009 and an increase of $1.05 per Mcf for first quarter 2008 from hedging activities. The price reductions and increase resulted from hedge gains and losses that were previously deferred in AOCL.         (2)   Average realized crude oil and condensate prices reflect reductions of $7.08 per Bbl for first quarter 2009 and $8.62 per Bbl for first quarter 2008 from hedging activities. The price reductions resulted from hedge losses that were previously deferred in AOCL.         (3)   Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Natural gas volumes sold to the LNG plant totaled 188 MMcfpd during first quarter 2009 and 173 MMcfpd during first quarter 2008.             23                    (4)   The natural gas-to-power project in Ecuador is 100% owned by our subsidiaries and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated for accounting purposes. Electricity sales are included in other revenues. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2 – Basis of Presentation.         (5)   Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea. See Equity Method Investees below.       Crude oil and condensate sales volumes in the table above differ from actual production volumes due to the timing of liquid hydrocarbon tanker liftings. Crude oil and condensate production volumes were as follows:                 Three Months Ended March 31,           2009       2008           (MBopd)       United States       35        43      West Africa       15        15      North Sea       8        11      Other International       4        6      Total Consolidated Operations       62        75      Equity Investees      2       2      Total      64       77              If the realized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, which are included in (gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments, had been included in oil and gas revenues, average realized prices would have been as follows:                             Three Months Ended March 31,           2009       2008           Crude Oil &       Natural       Crude Oil &       Natural           Condensate       Gas       Condensate       Gas           (Per Bbl)       (Per Mcf)       (Per Bbl)       (Per Mcf)       United States    $ 56.78     $ 5.51     $ 70.02     $ 8.63      West Africa      64.21       0.27       87.39       0.27      Total Consolidated Operations      55.65       3.48       77.83       5.16      Total      55.32       3.48       78.40       5.16                          Crude Oil and Condensate Sales – Crude oil and condensate sales decreased during first quarter 2009 as compared with first quarter 2008 due to the significant decrease in average realized prices combined with a decline in sales volumes. The decrease in sales volumes was due to continued Hurricane Ike-related shut-ins of certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets, the timing of liftings in Equatorial Guinea and the North Sea and natural field decline in the North Sea.   Revenues for first quarter 2009 and 2008 included deferred losses of $17 million and $97 million, respectively, reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges.   Natural Gas Sales – Natural gas sales decreased during first quarter 2009 as compared with first quarter 2008 due to the significant decrease in average realized prices. The effect of the price decreases was partially offset by an overall increase in sales volumes due to the following:           ·   increase in production from the Wattenberg, Piceance and Tri-state areas of our North America operations; and             ·   increase in volumes sold to the LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea;     and partially offset by:             ·   decrease in Israel sales volumes due to power plant downtime and milder weather conditions; and             ·   continued Hurricane Ike-related shut-ins of certain deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets.      Revenues for first quarter 2008 included a deferred gain of $37 million reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges. Revenues for first quarter 2009 included a de minimis amount reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges.           24            NGL Sales – Most of our US NGL production is from the Wattenberg field and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. NGL sales decreased during first quarter 2009 as compared with first quarter 2008 due to a 55% decrease in average realized NGL prices.   Equity Method Investees Our share of operations of equity method investees, Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO) and Alba Plant LLC (Alba Plant), was as follows:                Three Months Ended           March 31,           2009       2008       Net income (in millions):                 AMPCO and affiliates    $ -     $ 28      Alba Plant      11       34      Distributions/dividends (in millions):                     AMPCO and affiliates    $ -     $ 34      Alba Plant      -       42      Production volumes:                     Methanol (MMgal)      40       34      Condensate (MBopd)      2       2      LPG (MBpd)      6       6      Sales volumes:                     Methanol (MMgal)      35       34      Condensate (MBopd)      2       2      LPG (MBpd)      7       6      Average realized prices:                     Methanol (per gallon)    $ 0.46     $ 1.63      Condensate (per Bbl)      41.76       98.55      LPG (per Bbl)      26.89       60.78             The decrease in net income for each of the equity method investees for first quarter 2009 as compared with first quarter 2008 was due to significant decreases in average realized prices. No distributions were made during first quarter 2009 due to the decreases in net income and in anticipation of planned tax payments.   Other Revenues Other revenues include electricity sales and GMP revenues. See Item 1.

(2)   Oil and gas operating costs include labor, fuel, repairs, replacements, saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs.        Total production costs decreased first quarter 2009 as compared with first quarter 2008 primarily due to a decrease in production and ad valorem taxes offset by an increase in oil and gas operating costs. Production and ad valorem taxes in the US decreased primarily due to lower commodity prices. Other International production taxes were de minimis for first quarter 2009 due to lower commodity prices in China and the sale of our oil and gas interests in Argentina. US oil and gas operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in well counts, production volumes and water disposal costs in the Northern region, and were partially offset by a decrease in International operating costs.   Selected expenses on a per BOE basis were as follows:                   Three Months Ended           March 31,           2009       2008       Oil and gas operating costs    $ 5.09     $ 3.88      Workover and repair expense      0.41       0.33      Lease operating expense      5.50       4.21      Production and ad valorem taxes      1.00       2.23      Transportation expense      0.63       0.68      Total production costs (1) (2)    $ 7.13     $ 7.12                    (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and costs attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $1.30 per BOE for first quarter 2009 and $1.11 per BOE for first quarter 2008.

Oil and gas exploration expense for first quarter 2009 includes an increase in US seismic expense in support of the central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. Exploration expense also includes stock-based compensation expense of $2 million for first quarter 2009 and less than $1 million for first quarter 2008.   Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization – DD&A expense was as follows:                Three Months Ended           March 31,           2009       2008           (in millions, except unit rate)       DD&A expense    $ 197     $ 201      Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations      3       2      Total DD&A expense    $ 200     $ 203      Unit rate per BOE (1)    $ 11.01     $ 10.42                 (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and costs attributable to equity method investees.

The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $1.67 per BOE for first quarter 2009 and $1.32 per BOE for first quarter 2008.       Total DD&A expense for first quarter 2009 remained flat as compared with first quarter 2008. DD&A expense was higher in the US due to an increase in Northern region production (primarily in Piceance and Wattenberg), offset somewhat by decreased production in the Gulf of Mexico. DD&A expense also included $4 million of abandoned asset expense in first quarter 2009.   The higher DD&A unit rate resulted from the change in our mix of production, including lower volumes in Israel, and was also impacted by negative reserve revisions related to lower year-end 2008 commodity prices.               27             General and Administrative Expense – General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows:                 Three Months Ended           March 31,           2009       2008       G&A expense (in millions)    $ 59     $ 60      Unit rate per BOE (1)    $ 3.23     $ 3.09                  (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and costs attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $0.59 per BOE for first quarter 2009 and $0.48 per BOE for first quarter 2008.       G&A expense during first quarter 2009 remained flat as compared with first quarter 2008. G&A expense included stock-based compensation expense of $9 million in each of first quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively.   Asset Impairments – During first quarter 2009 we recorded total pre-tax (non-cash) impairment charges of $437 million on certain US oil and gas properties, primarily due to lower natural gas prices. In determining the fair values of the impaired properties, we applied the fair value definition of SFAS 157. SFAS 157 requires that fair values be determined from the perspective of a market participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, multiple valuation techniques, the most advantageous market and assumptions around the highest and best use of the assets. Due to the absence of comparable market data for the impaired properties, we estimated the fair values using a discounted cash flow method. Estimated future cash flows were based on management’s expectations for the future and included management’s estimates of future oil and gas production, commodity prices based on commodity futures price strips as of March 31, 2009, operating and development costs, as well as appropriate discount rates. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, the fair values of the impaired properties were classified as Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. A change in any of the assumptions used, such as a significant increase or decreased in estimated commodity prices or production, could have had a significant impact on the amount of the impairment loss recognized. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements.   Other Operating Expense, Net – Other operating expense, net includes electricity generation expense and GMP expense. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2 – Basis of Presentation.   (Gain) Loss on Commodity Derivative Instruments – See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements.   Interest Expense and Capitalized Interest – Interest expense and capitalized interest were as follows:                 Three Months Ended           March 31,           2009       2008           (in millions)       Interest expense    $ 24     $ 27      Capitalized interest      (6 )     (10 )    Interest expense, net    $ 18     $ 17              Interest expense decreased during first quarter 2009, as compared with first quarter 2008 due to a declining rate of interest applicable to our credit facility from 2.99% at March 31, 2008 to 0.81% at March 31, 2009, offset by a higher rate of interest related to the issuance of $1 billion 10-year unsecured notes on February 27, 2009. The amount of interest capitalized decreased primarily due to a lower average interest rate applicable to our long-term debt.   Other (Income) Expense, Net – See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2 – Basis of Presentation.   Income Tax Provision (Benefit) – The income tax provision (benefit) was as follows:                Three Months Ended           March 31,           2009       2008       Income tax provision (benefit) (in millions)    $ (186 )   $ 101      Effective rate      50 %     32 %            Our effective tax rate increased during first quarter 2009 as compared with first quarter 2008 due primarily to the fact that the 2009 rate represents a tax benefit divided by a pre-tax loss. In that case, our favorable permanent differences, such as income from equity method investees, have the effect of increasing the tax benefit which, in turn, increases the effective rate.             28              LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Overview Our primary cash needs are to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures related to the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, to repay outstanding borrowings and associated interest payments and other contractual commitments and to pay dividends. Traditional sources of our liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under credit facilities. Occasional sales of non-strategic crude oil and natural gas properties may also generate cash.   The ongoing disruption in the credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions. We have reviewed the creditworthiness of the banks and financial institutions with which we maintain our investments as well as the securities underlying our investments. Thus far, our liquidity and financial position have not been materially impacted. However, further deterioration in the credit markets could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. See Executive Overview – Impact of Recession and Current Credit and Commodity Markets.   Cash and Cash Equivalents – We had $1.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2009. Our cash is denominated in US dollars and is invested in US Treasury securities and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. In response to the credit market crisis, we shortened the duration of our investment maturities and increased our investments in US Treasury securities.   A majority of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries and most would be subject to US income taxes if repatriated. We currently intend to use a majority of our international cash to fund international projects, including the development of West Africa and Israel.   During fourth quarter 2008, we performed an analysis of projected short-term working capital needs as well as long-term capital requirements for our US and foreign operations. As a result, we repatriated $180 million of the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries during first quarter 2009. We used the proceeds for debt repayment and general corporate purposes. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Income Taxes for a discussion of the related tax effects.   Commodity Derivative Instruments – We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations. Such instruments include variable to fixed commodity price swaps, collars and basis swaps. Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. If actual commodity prices are higher than the fixed or ceiling prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be lower than if we had no derivative instruments. Conversely, if actual commodity prices are lower than the fixed or floor prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be higher than if we had no derivative instruments. Except for certain minor derivative contracts that are entered into from time to time by our marketing subsidiary, none of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements.   Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of March 31, 2009, the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $427 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $46 million (after consideration of netting agreements). See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for a discussion of counterparty credit risk and Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of commodity derivative instruments.   Contractual Obligations In February 2009, we completed an underwritten public offering of $1 billion of 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019. See Financing Activities below. As a result, our future debt principal payments as of March 31, 2009 consist of the following: $25 million for the remainder of 2009; $726 million for 2012; and $1.6 billion for 2014 and beyond for a total of $2.4 billion. Based on the total debt balance, scheduled maturities and interest rates in effect at March 31, 2009, our cash payments for interest would be $88 million for the remainder of 2009; $133 million in 2010; $133 million in 2011; $132 million in 2012; $127 million in 2013; and $1.3 billion for the remaining years for a total of $2.0 billion. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3 – Debt Issuance.           29            Cash Flows Cash flow information is as follows:                  Three Months Ended           March 31,           2009       2008           (in millions)       Total cash provided by (used in):                 Operating activities    $ 185     $ 506      Investing activities      (399 )     (355 )    Financing activities      91       (4 )    Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents    $ (123 )   $ 147               Operating Activities – Net cash provided by operating activities for first quarter 2009 decreased as compared with first quarter 2008 due primarily to decreases in commodity prices.   Investing Activities – Our investing activities include capital spending for oil and gas properties, which may be offset by proceeds from property sales. Net cash used in investing activities increased during first quarter 2009 as compared with first quarter 2008 and consisted only of capital spending. First quarter 2008 activity included capital spending of $464 million, which was partially offset by net proceeds of $109 million from asset sales. See Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures below.   Financing Activities – Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During first quarter 2009, we received $989 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 8¼% senior notes. Funds were also provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($14 million). We used cash for net repayments of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility ($880 million), to pay dividends on our common stock ($31 million), and to repurchase shares of our common stock ($1 million).   In comparison, during first quarter 2008, funds were provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($19 million) and we used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($21 million) and repurchase shares of our common stock ($2 million). There were no net changes in outstanding debt.   Investing Activities Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures – Information for investing activities (on an accrual basis) is as follows:                  Three Months Ended           March 31,           2009       2008           (in millions)       Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures                 Unproved property acquisition    $ 16     $ 176      Exploration      95       45      Development      231       246      Corporate and other      44       19      Total    $ 386     $ 486               Unproved property acquisition costs for first quarter 2009 and 2008 include primarily lease bonuses on deepwater lease blocks acquired in central Gulf of Mexico lease sales.   Property Sales – In February 2008, effective July 1, 2007, we sold our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million.   Financing Activities Long-Term Debt – Our principal source of liquidity is an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures December 9, 2012. The commitment is $2.1 billion until December 9, 2011 at which time the commitment reduces to $1.8 billion. The credit facility (i) provides for credit facility fee rates that range from 5 basis points to 15 basis points per year depending upon our credit rating, (ii) makes available short-term loans up to an aggregate amount of $300 million and (iii) provides for interest rates that are based upon the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 20 basis points to 70 basis points depending upon our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility. The credit facility is with certain commercial lending institutions and is available for general corporate purposes.           30            In order to provide increased liquidity and lengthen our weighted average debt maturity, on February 27, 2009 we completed an underwritten public offering of $1 billion of 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019, receiving net proceeds of $989 million. We used substantially all of the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility.   As a result, at March 31, 2009, borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaled $726 million, leaving almost $1.4 billion available for use. The weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility at March 31, 2009 was 0.81%.   Our outstanding fixed-rate debt, including the new 8¼% senior unsecured notes discussed above, totaled $1.6 billion at March 31, 2009. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 7.73%, with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2097.   Our ratio of debt-to-book capital was 28% at March 31, 2009 as compared with 26% at December 31, 2008. We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes both long-term debt, excluding unamortized discount, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.   Short-Term Borrowings – We owe $25 million in the form of an installment payment to the seller of properties we purchased in 2007. The amount is due May 11, 2009 and is included in short-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets. Interest on the unpaid amount is due quarterly and accrues at a LIBOR rate plus .30%. The interest rate was 1.76% at March 31, 2009.   Our committed credit facility has been supplemented by short-term borrowings under various uncommitted credit lines used for working capital purposes. Uncommitted credit lines may be offered by certain banks from time to time at rates negotiated at the time of borrowing. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit lines at March 31, 2009 or December 31, 2008. Depending upon future credit market conditions, these sources may or may not be available. However, we are not dependent on them to fund our day-to-day operations.   Dividends – We paid a quarterly cash dividend of 18.0 cents per share of common stock during first quarter 2009 and 12.0 cents per share of common stock during first quarter 2008. On April 27, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18.0 cents per common share, payable May 26, 2009 to shareholders of record on May 11, 2009. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.   Exercise of Stock Options – We received cash proceeds of $11 million from the exercise of stock options during first quarter 2009 as compared with $10 million during first quarter 2008.   Common Stock Repurchases – We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 17,510 shares with a value of $1 million during first quarter 2009 and 24,380 shares with a value of $2 million during first quarter 2008.            31            ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   Commodity Price Risk Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes – We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.   At March 31, 2009, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps, collars and basis swaps related to crude oil and natural gas sales. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net receivable position with a fair value of $381 million. Based on the March 31, 2009 published forward commodity price curves for the underlying commodities, a price increase of $1.00 per Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $9 million. A price increase of $0.10 per MMBtu for natural gas would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $8 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.        Interest Rate Risk      Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other variable-rate debt and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.   At March 31, 2009, we had $2.4 billion (excluding unamortized discount) of long-term debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.6 billion was fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.73%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss.    The remainder of our long-term debt, $726 million at March 31, 2009, was variable-rate debt drawn under our credit facility. We also had $25 million of short-term variable-rate debt at March 31, 2009. Variable-rate debt exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to increases in market interest rates. We estimate that a hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the March 31, 2009 balance of our variable-rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $2 million.   We occasionally enter into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate “locks” used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At March 31, 2009, AOCL included $2 million, net of tax, related to interest rate locks. This amount is currently being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of our 5¼% Senior Notes due April 2014.   We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our short-term investments. As of March 31, 2009, approximately 46% of our cash was invested in US Treasury securities. A hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the March 31, 2009 balance would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately $1 million.        Foreign Currency Risk      We have not entered into foreign currency derivative instruments. The US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. We do not have any significant monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than our foreign deferred tax liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. An increase in exchange rates between the US dollar and the currency of the foreign tax jurisdiction in which these liabilities are located could result in the use of additional cash to settle these liabilities. However, transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and we do not believe we are currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis. Such gains or losses are included in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.                 32              DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:             ·   the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by us;               ·   our growth strategies;              ·   our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;             ·   anticipated trends in our business;             ·   our future results of operations;             ·   effect of current volatility in the credit markets;             ·   our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;             ·   market conditions in the oil and gas industry;             ·   our ability to make and integrate acquisitions; and             ·   the impact of governmental regulation.      Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors included herein, if any, and included in our 2008 annual report on Form 10-K, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our 2008 annual report on Form 10-K is available on our website at www.nobleenergyinc.com.  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by Charles D. Davidson, our principal executive officer, and Chris Tong, our principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              33            PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   See Item I. Financial Statements – Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, other than the following:   The proposed United States federal budget for fiscal year 2010 includes certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.   On February 26, 2009, the Office of Management and Budget released a summary of the President’s proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2010. The proposed budget repeals many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by US oil and gas companies and imposes new taxes. The provisions include: elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; increases in the taxation of foreign source income; levy of an excise tax on Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers; and implementation of a fee on non-producing leases located on federal lands.   Should some or all of these provisions become law our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. This could also reduce our drilling activities. Since none of these proposals have yet to be voted on or become law, we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.   ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
