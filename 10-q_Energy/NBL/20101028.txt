Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our operations and investment in Ecuador may be adversely affected by the country’s new hydrocarbon reform bill.     OUTLOOK   Our expected crude oil, natural gas and NGL production for the remainder of 2010 may be impacted by several factors including:           ·   overall level and timing of capital expenditures which, dependent upon our drilling success and notwithstanding the other factors listed below, are expected to maintain our near-term production volumes (See 2010 Budget discussion below);            ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas of our US operations and in the North Sea;            ·   impact of potential legislative and regulatory changes on deepwater Gulf of Mexico operating and safety standards for producing activities due to the Deepwater Horizon Incident;            ·   variations in sales volumes of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea related to potential downtime at the methanol, LPG and/or LNG plants;            ·   Israeli demand for electricity which affects demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation, market growth and competing deliveries of natural gas from Egypt;            ·   variations in North Sea sales volumes due to potential FPSO downtime and timing of liftings;            ·   seasonal variations in rainfall in Ecuador that affect our natural gas-to-power project;            ·   potential hurricane-related volume curtailments in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas;            ·   potential winter storm-related volume curtailments in the Northern region of our US operations;            ·   potential pipeline and processing facility capacity constraints in the Rocky Mountains and deepwater Gulf of Mexico;            ·   potential volume curtailments in Ecuador due to unsettled economic and political environment;            ·   impact of asset purchases;            25      Table of Contents             ·   timing of significant project completion and initial production; and            ·   impact of sales of non-core operating assets expected to close in the fourth quarter 2010.      2010 Budget  We have updated our business plan for the remainder of 2010 to take into account the impact of the Federal Deepwater Moratorium as well as the subsequent delay in the resumption of activities now that the Moratorium has been lifted. The delay in spending caused by the Moratorium will have a positive effect on our short-term net cash flows due to reductions in capital spending.   Our total capital investment program for 2010 is now estimated at $2.2 billion, $300 million less than the original budget, with approximately 37% going toward major project investments, 17% for exploration and appraisal activities, and the remaining 46% for ongoing maintenance and near-term development opportunities. We have planned to spend about $832 million on major project investments, with the majority of capital directed toward the development of Galapagos in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Aseng offshore Equatorial Guinea and Tamar offshore Israel. We expect to spend approximately $380 million for exploration activities. The remainder of our budget is focused on liquid-rich and emerging opportunities onshore US, as well as near-term development projects in Israel, the North Sea and China.   Excluded from the budget discussed above is the $498 million total purchase price for the DJ Basin asset acquisition on March 1, 2010, as well as $258 million of non-cash capital expected to be accrued for the Aseng FPSO capital lease.   We have a well-balanced and diverse domestic and international portfolio as well as ample liquidity which allow us to engage in activities that mitigate the impact of the Moratorium. Numerous opportunities are available to us, and it is possible that we may reallocate capital to onshore US or international locations. We will continue to review our options as the legislative and regulatory response to the Deepwater Horizon Incident unfolds.   We expect that the remaining 2010 budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and/or other financing. We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the year based on drilling results, commodity prices, cash flows from operations, the full impact of the Federal Deepwater Moratorium and legislative response, and property acquisitions and divestitures. Our capital spending is integrated with our goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Structure/Financing Strategy, below.   Risk and Insurance Program Update  In accordance with industry practices, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential perils confronting our operations and in coverage amounts and deductible levels that we believe to be economic. Consistent with that profile, our insurance program is structured to provide us financial protection from significant unfavorable losses resulting from damages to, or the loss of, physical assets or loss of human life, liability claims of third parties, and business interruption (loss of production) attributed to certain assets and including such occurrences as well blowouts and resulting oil spills, at a level that balances cost of insurance with our assessment of risk and our ability to achieve a reasonable rate of return on our investments. We maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice and we regularly review our risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and revise our insurance program accordingly.   We expect the future availability and cost of insurance to be impacted by the recent Deepwater Horizon Incident. Impacts could include: tighter underwriting standards, limitations on scope and amount of coverage, and higher premiums, and will depend, in part, on future changes in laws and regulations regarding exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills. We will continue to monitor the expected regulatory and legislative response and its impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile, and adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection, at a level that we can afford considering the cost of insurance and our desired rates of return, against disruption to our operations and cash flows.   We currently carry insurance protection for our net share of any potential financial losses occurring as a result of events such as the Deepwater Horizon Incident. This protection consists of $250 million of well control, pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage and $251 million of additional pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage, which also covers third party personal injury and death. Consequently if we were to experience an accident similar to the Deepwater Horizon Incident, our total coverage for cleanup and consequential damages would be $501 million for our net share, subject to reduction for claims related to well control and third party damages.   We are a member of Oil Insurance Limited (OIL), a mutual insurance company. Due to recent reductions in windstorm coverage by OIL, we now believe it is commercially more reasonable to self insure against this particular risk. Therefore, we have elected to self insure our 2010 windstorm exposure. Recent abandonment activities on the Gulf of Mexico shelf have significantly reduced our windstorm exposure as our remaining Gulf of Mexico assets are primarily subsea operations. However, we are now responsible for substantially all windstorm-related damages to these assets.         26      Table of Contents     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Revenues   Revenues were as follows:                       Increase  (Decrease) from  Prior Year          2010       2009          (millions)                      Three Months Ended September 30,                  Oil, Gas and NGL Sales    $ 704     $ 573       23 %   Income from Equity Method Investees      34       25       36 %   Other Revenues      17       23       (26 %)   Total    $ 755     $ 621       22 %                              Nine Months Ended September 30,                      Oil, Gas and NGL Sales    $ 2,102     $ 1,440       46 %   Income from Equity Method Investees      85       52       63 %   Other Revenues      52       61       (15 %)   Total    $ 2,239     $ 1,553       44 %     Changes in revenues are discussed below.         27      Table of Contents     Oil, Gas and NGL Sales Average daily sales volumes and average realized sales prices were as follows:           Sales Volumes       Average Realized Sales Prices          Crude Oil & Condensate       Natural Gas       NGLs       Total       Crude Oil & Condensate       Natural Gas       NGLs          (MBpd)       (MMcfpd)       (MBpd)       (MBoepd) (1)       (Per Bbl)       (Per Mcf)       (Per Bbl)      Three Months Ended September 30, 2010                                          United States (2)      41       399       13       120     $ 71.28     $ 3.87     $ 36.30     Equatorial Guinea (3) (4)      8       243       -       49       76.28       0.27       -     Israel      -       178       -       30       -       3.85       -     North Sea      13       6       -       14       78.89       5.82       -     Ecuador (5)      -       28       -       5       -       -       -     China      4       -       -       4       71.37       -       -     Total Consolidated Operations      66       854       13       222       73.41       2.82       36.30     Equity Investees (6)      2       -       6       8       77.03       -       50.83     Total Operations      68       854       19       230     $ 73.53     $ 2.82     $ 40.77     Three Months Ended September 30, 2009                                                      United States (2)      39       397       10       115     $ 62.30     $ 3.05     $ 25.39     Equatorial Guinea (3) (4)      14       228       -       52       63.10       0.27       -     Israel      -       144       -       24       -       3.95       -     North Sea      8       5       -       9       69.56       4.63       -     Ecuador (5)      -       28       -       5       -       -       -     China      4       -       -       4       62.75       -       -     Total Consolidated Operations      65       802       10       209       63.36       2.41       25.39     Equity Investees (6)      2       -       6       8       66.33       -       38.26     Total Operations      67       802       16       217     $ 63.46     $ 2.41     $ 30.25     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010                                                      United States (2)      40       399       13       119     $ 73.31     $ 4.38     $ 40.17     Equatorial Guinea (3) (4)      11       221       -       48       75.44       0.27       -     Israel      -       129       -       22       -       4.08       -     North Sea      10       7       -       11       77.33       5.25       -     Ecuador (5)      -       28       -       4       -       -       -     China      4       -       -       4       73.27       -       -     Total Consolidated Operations      65       784       13       208       74.30       3.13       40.17     Equity Investees (6)      2       -       5       7       75.84       -       52.04     Total Operations      67       784       18       215     $ 74.35     $ 3.13     $ 43.58     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009                                                      United States (2)      37       401       10       113     $ 50.45     $ 3.36     $ 24.70     Equatorial Guinea (3) (4)      14       238       -       54       51.94       0.27       -     Israel      -       117       -       20       -       3.27       -     North Sea      7       5       -       8       57.61       5.94       -     Ecuador (5)      -       24       -       4       -       -       -     China      4       -       -       4       49.76       -       -     Total Consolidated Operations      62       785       10       203       51.55       2.40       24.70     Equity Investees (6)      2       -       6       8       56.42       -       31.65     Total Operations      64       785       16       211     $ 51.70     $ 2.40     $ 27.40           (1)   Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of oil equivalent. This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given recent commodity price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas is significantly less than the price for a barrel of oil.          (2)   Average realized crude oil and condensate prices reflect reductions of $1.25 per Bbl and $1.89 per Bbl for third quarter 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $1.31 per Bbl and $2.28 per Bbl for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009, respectively, from hedging activities.      Average realized natural gas prices reflect a reduction of $0.01 per Mcf for the first nine months of 2010 and an increase of $0.01 per Mcf for third quarter 2009 from hedging activities. The price increase/reduction resulted from hedge gains/losses that were previously deferred in AOCL. The average realized natural gas prices for the third quarter of 2010 and first nine months of 2009 were not impacted by hedging activities, as the net deferred gains reclassified from AOCL were de minimis.         28      Table of Contents         (3)   Average realized crude oil and condensate prices reflect a reduction of $5.32 per Bbl for third quarter 2009 and $5.84 per Bbl for the first nine months of 2009 from hedging activities. The price reduction resulted from hedge losses that were previously deferred in AOCL. All hedge gains or losses relating to Equatorial Guinea production had been reclassified to revenues by December 31, 2009.          (4)   Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.          (5)   The natural gas-to-power project in Ecuador is 100% owned by our subsidiaries and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated for accounting purposes. Electricity sales are included in other revenues. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation.          (6)   Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea. See Equity Method Investees below.      If the realized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, which are included in (gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations, had been included in oil and gas revenues, the effect on average realized prices would have been as follows:           Commodity Price Increase (Decrease)          2010       2009          Crude Oil & Condensate       Natural Gas       Crude Oil & Condensate       Natural Gas          (Per Bbl)       (Per Mcf)       (Per Bbl)       (Per Mcf)      Three Months Ended September 30,                            United States    $ 0.86     $ 0.87     $ 9.29     $ 1.95     Equatorial Guinea      (2.09 )     -       12.99       -     Total Consolidated Operations      0.27       0.41       8.41       1.00     Total Operations      0.26       0.41       8.14       1.00                                        Nine Months Ended September 30,                                    United States    $ 0.16     $ 0.63     $ 14.38     $ 1.84     Equatorial Guinea      (1.86 )     -       17.48       -     Total Consolidated Operations      (0.22 )     0.32       12.46       0.97     Total Operations      (0.21 )     0.32       12.09       0.97       An analysis of revenues from sales of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs is as follows:           Sales Revenues          Crude Oil & Condensate       Natural Gas       NGLs       Total      (millions)                            Three Months Ended September 30, 2009    $ 377     $ 172     $ 24     $ 573     Changes due to                                    Increase in Sales Volumes      8       11       7       26     Increase in Sales Prices Before Hedging      52       31       13       96     Change in Amounts Reclassified from AOCL      9       -       -       9     Three Months Ended September 30, 2010    $ 446     $ 214     $ 44     $ 704                                        Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009    $ 876     $ 498     $ 66     $ 1,440     Changes due to                                    Increase (Decrease) in Sales Volumes      35       (4 )     22       53     Increase in Sales Prices Before Hedging      371       153       55       579     Change in Amounts Reclassified from AOCL      31       (1 )     -       30     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010    $ 1,313     $ 646     $ 143     $ 2,102       Crude oil and condensate sales – Revenues from crude oil and condensate sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 as compared with 2009 due to the following:           ·   an increase in total consolidated average realized prices due to increased demand resulting from the global economic recovery;            ·   increased production from the Central DJ Basin in the northern region of our US operations due to ongoing development activity in the Wattenberg field and the horizontal Niobrara development;            ·   additional production from the DJ Basin asset acquisition earlier in 2010;            29      Table of Contents             ·   crude oil production from a sidetrack to a Swordfish natural gas well that commenced production first quarter 2010;            ·   renewed production from Ticonderoga in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico which was off-line first quarter 2009 as a result of hurricane damage to third-party processing and pipeline facilities; and            ·   an increase in North Sea sales volumes primarily as a result of increased deliverability at the Dumbarton complex, which included the addition of two Lochranza wells in 2010;     partially offset by          ·   a decrease in onshore US volumes due to the sale of mature oil assets;            ·   a decrease in deepwater Gulf of Mexico volumes due to natural field decline and third party downstream facility constraints;            ·   a decrease in onshore US volumes due to natural field decline in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast areas; and            ·   a decrease in Equatorial Guinea sales volumes due to the timing of liftings.      Revenues from crude oil and condensate sales included deferred losses of $5 million and $14 million for third quarter 2010 and 2009, respectively, and $14 million and $45 million for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009, respectively, reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges.   Natural gas sales – Revenues from natural gas sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 as compared with 2009 due to the following:           ·   an increase in total consolidated and US average realized prices due to increased demand resulting from the economic recovery;            ·   an increase in Israel average realized prices for the first nine months of 2010, which are tied to the global liquid markets;            ·   increased production from the Central DJ Basin in the northern region of our US operations due to ongoing development activity in the Wattenberg field and the horizontal Niobrara development;            ·   additional production from the DJ Basin asset acquisition earlier in 2010; and            ·   an increase in Israel sales volumes due to an increase in demand for our natural gas driven by increased electricity production due to warmer weather and lower levels of competitor natural gas imports from Egypt;     partially offset by          ·   a decrease in Equatorial Guinea sales volumes for the first nine months of 2010 due to the planned shut-down of the Alba field for facilities maintenance and repair;            ·   lower natural gas production in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico at Raton and Swordfish; and            ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas.      Revenues from natural gas sales included deferred losses of $1 million for the first nine months of 2010 reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges. Revenues for the third quarter of 2010 and the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 included de minimis amounts reclassified from AOCL.   NGL sales – Most of our US NGL production is from the Wattenberg field and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. NGL sales revenues increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 as compared with 2009 due to an increase in sales volumes from the Wattenberg field and an increase in consolidated average realized prices which benefitted from increased demand resulting from the global economic recovery.   Income from Equity Method Investees We have a 45% interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC, which owns and operates a methanol plant and related facilities and a 28% interest in Alba Plant LLC, which owns and operates a liquefied petroleum gas processing plant. Both plants are located onshore in Equatorial Guinea. Equity method investments are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets, our share of earnings is reported as income from equity method investees in our consolidated statements of operations, and our share of dividends is reported within cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.   The increase in income from equity method investees for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 as compared with 2009 was due to an increase in average realized condensate, LPG and methanol prices from increased demand due to the global economic recovery. Condensate and LPG sales volumes and average realized prices are included in the average daily sales volumes and average realized sales prices table above. Methanol sales volumes and prices were as follows:             Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,            2010       2009       2010       2009      Methanol Sales Volumes in MMgal      33       41       102       109     Methanol Sales Prices    $ 0.84     $ 0.64     $ 0.84     $ 0.52       The increase in dividends from equity method investees to $91 million for the first nine months of 2010 as compared with $37 million for the first nine months of 2009 was due to their increased profitability.         30      Table of Contents     Other Revenues Other revenues include electricity sales and other revenues from operating activities.

(2)   Lease operating expense includes oil and gas operating costs (labor, fuel, repairs, replacements, saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs) and workover expense.       For the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, total production expense increased as compared with 2009 due to the following:           ·   an increase in lease operating expense in the US due to the acquisition of producing properties;            ·   an increase in North Sea lease operating expense due to higher sales volumes;            ·   an increase in production taxes in the US and China due to higher commodity prices; and            ·   an increase in transportation expense in the Wattenberg field due to increased crude oil and condensate production and the use of a new interstate crude oil transportation pipeline system to market production.            32      Table of Contents     Oil and Gas Exploration Expense Components of oil and gas exploration expense were as follows:             Total       United States       West Africa (1)       Eastern Mediterranean (2)       North Sea       Other Int'l, Corporate (3)      (millions)                                        Three Months Ended September 30, 2010                                    Dry Hole Cost    $ 2     $ 1     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ 1     Seismic      17       4       -       4       -       9     Staff Expense      12       (4 )     1       1       1       13     Other      4       4       -       -       -       -     Total Exploration Expense    $ 35     $ 5     $ 1     $ 5     $ 1     $ 23     Three Months Ended September 30, 2009                                              Dry Hole Cost    $ 3     $ 3     $ -     $ -     $ -     $ -     Seismic      7       5       -       2       -       -     Staff Expense      17       4       3       -       -       10     Other      -       -       -       -       -       -     Total Exploration Expense    $ 27     $ 12     $ 3     $ 2     $ -     $ 10     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010                                              Dry Hole Cost    $ 57     $ 53     $ 3     $ -     $ -     $ 1     Seismic      52       32       5       6       -       9     Staff Expense      46       4       4       2       2       34     Other      12       12       -       -       -       -     Total Exploration Expense    $ 167     $ 101     $ 12     $ 8     $ 2     $ 44     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009                                              Dry Hole Cost    $ 11     $ 8     $ 4     $ -     $ -     $ (1 )   Seismic      37       33       -       4       -       -     Staff Expense      50       10       9       1       1       29     Other      4       4       -       -       -       -     Total Exploration Expense    $ 102     $ 55     $ 13     $ 5     $ 1     $ 28           (1)   West Africa includes Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon.          (2)   Eastern Mediterranean includes Israel and Cyprus.          (3)   Other International includes China, Ecuador and other amounts spent in support of various international new ventures.      Oil and gas exploration expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 increased as compared with 2009. US dry hole expense was associated with the Double Mountain exploration well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which found noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons. US seismic expense was incurred in support of Central Gulf of Mexico lease sales and West Africa seismic expenditures represented the acquisition of 3-D seismic information for Cameroon.         33      Table of Contents     Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD&A expense was as follows:           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,          2010       2009       2010       2009      (millions, except unit rate)                            DD&A Expense    $ 227     $ 201     $ 649     $ 590     Accretion of Discount on Asset Retirement Obligations      4       4       13       11     Total DD&A Expense    $ 231     $ 205     $ 662     $ 601     Unit Rate per BOE (1)    $ 11.35     $ 10.68     $ 11.64     $ 10.86            (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.       Total DD&A expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 increased as compared with 2009 due to the following:           ·   higher production in the DJ Basin, Piceance and Western Oklahoma areas of our US operations, which have high DD&A rates relative to production from Equatorial Guinea and Israel which have lower DD&A rates;            ·   ongoing capital spending in the Northern region of our US operations;            ·   higher sales volumes in the North Sea; and            ·   impact of lower year-end 2009 commodity prices on oil and gas reserves;    partially offset by         ·   lower DD&A expense in the Mid-Continent area which has a reduced net book value resulting from an impairment recorded at the end of 2009; and            ·   the cessation of DD&A associated with assets held-for-sale and/or sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2010.      The unit rate per BOE increased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 as compared with 2009 due to the change in mix of production, including decreases in lower-cost sales volumes from Equatorial Guinea and the impact of lower year-end 2009 commodity prices on oil and gas reserves, offset by a lower rate for the Mid-Continent area and the cessation of DD&A associated with assets held-for-sale.   General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows:           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,          2010       2009       2010       2009      G&A Expense (millions)    $ 65     $ 53     $ 194     $ 173     Unit Rate per BOE (1)    $ 3.20     $ 2.78     $ 3.42     $ 3.11            (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.       G&A expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 increased as compared with 2009 primarily due to additional expenses relating to personnel and office costs in support of our major projects.   Gain on Asset Sales Gain on asset sales for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009 was related to the sale of non-core onshore US assets and the recognition of the gain on the sale of Argentina assets, respectively.

Interest expense increased for the first nine months of 2010, as compared with 2009. The increase in interest expense primarily relates to our $1 billion 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019, which we issued on February 27, 2009. The higher rate on the senior unsecured notes replaced the substantially lower rate applicable to our revolving credit facility. See also Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities below.   The increases in the amount of interest capitalized are due to higher work in progress amounts related to major long-term projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and Israel and the higher interest rate associated with our $1 billion 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019.   Other Non-operating (Income) Expense, Net Other non-operating (income) expense, net includes deferred compensation (income) expense, interest income and other (income) expense. The decrease for the first nine months of 2010 was due to a reduction in deferred compensation expense and increases in interest and other income. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation.   Income Tax Provision (Benefit)   See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 14. Income Taxes for a discussion of the change in our effective tax rate during the first nine months of 2010 as compared with 2009.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Capital Structure/Financing Strategy We strive to employ a capital structure, emphasizing a strong balance sheet, and financing strategy designed to provide ample liquidity throughout the commodity price cycle, sufficient to fund growth and major project development. Specifically, we strive to retain the ability to fund long-cycle, capital intensive development projects while also maintaining the capability for financially attractive periodic mergers and acquisitions activity, such as the DJ Basin asset acquisition on March 1, 2010. We endeavor to maintain an investment grade debt rating in support of these objectives. We also utilize a commodity price hedging program to reduce commodity price uncertainty and enhance the predictability of cash flows along with a risk and insurance program to protect against disruption to our operations and cash flows. See Risk and Insurance Program Update, above.         35      Table of Contents     We have reduced our total capital investment program for 2010 to $2.2 billion from $2.5 billion. We expect funding to be provided by cash flows from operations, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and/or other financing. Cash may also be generated by occasional sales of non-strategic crude oil and natural gas properties.   Our capital structure approach allows us to maintain a strong liquidity position. At September 30, 2010, we had over $1 billion in cash and significant remaining capacity under our credit facility for a total liquidity of $2.9 billion. This strong financial capacity, coupled with our well-balanced and diverse portfolio, provides us with flexibility in our investment decisions.   Information regarding cash and debt balances was as follows:           September 30,       December 31,          2010       2009      (millions, except percentages)                Cash and Cash Equivalents    $ 1,149     $ 1,014     Amount Available to be Borrowed Under Credit Facility      1,750       1,718     Total Liquidity    $ 2,899     $ 2,732                        Total Debt (Excluding Unamortized Discount)    $ 2,201     $ 2,045     Total Shareholders' Equity      6,737       6,157     Debt-to-Capital Ratio (1)      25 %     25 %         (1)   We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes both long-term debt, excluding unamortized discount, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.      Cash and Cash Equivalents We had $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2010, primarily denominated in US dollars and invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. A majority of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries and most would be subject to US income taxes if repatriated. We currently intend to use our international cash to fund international projects, including the planned developments in Equatorial Guinea and Israel.   Credit Facility We have an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures December 9, 2012. The commitment is $2.1 billion until December 9, 2011 at which time the commitment reduces to $1.8 billion. We ended third quarter 2010 with almost $1.75 billion remaining available for borrowing of the current $2.1 billion commitment.   Derivative Instruments  We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs. Such instruments include variable to fixed commodity price swaps, two and three-way collars and basis swaps. Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. If actual commodity prices are higher than the fixed or ceiling prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be lower than if we had no derivative instruments. Conversely, if actual commodity prices are lower than the fixed or floor prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be higher than if we had no derivative instruments. Except for certain minor derivative contracts that we enter into from time to time in order to market third-party natural gas, none of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements. We also use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk by entering into forward contracts or swap agreements to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with fixed or floating rate borrowings.   Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of September 30, 2010 the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $136 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $11 million (after consideration of netting agreements). Interest rate derivative instruments, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense over the term of the related notes. As of September 30, 2010 the fair value of our interest rate derivative liability was $141 million. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 7. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for a discussion of counterparty credit risk and Note 8. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of derivative instruments.         36      Table of Contents     Cash Flows Cash flow information is as follows:           Nine Months Ended September 30,          2010       2009      (millions)                Total Cash Provided By (Used in)                Operating Activities    $ 1,452     $ 986     Investing Activities      (1,232 )     (1,012 )   Financing Activities      (85 )     (188 )   Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents    $ 135     $ (214 )     Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2010 increased as compared with the first nine months of 2009 due to increases in commodity prices, higher sales volumes, the refund of deepwater Gulf of Mexico royalties and an increase in dividends received from equity method investees.   Investing Activities Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties, which may be offset by proceeds from property sales. Capital spending, on a cash basis, increased by $772 million during the first nine months of 2010 as compared with the first nine months of 2009, primarily due to the DJ Basin asset acquisition, and was offset by $552 million proceeds from the sale of non-core onshore US assets. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures. See also Investing Activities – Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures below.   Financing Activities  Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first nine months of 2010, $32 million of funds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Funds were also provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($54 million). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($95 million) and to repurchase shares of our common stock ($12 million).   In comparison, during the first nine months of 2009, funds were provided by net proceeds from the issuance of our 8¼% senior notes ($989 million) and cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($18 million). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($94 million), to repurchase shares of our common stock ($1 million), for net repayments of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility ($1.1 billion), for the repayment of an installment note ($25 million), and for the repurchase of senior debt ($4 million).   Investing Activities Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures  Information for investing activities (on an accrual basis) is as follows:           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,          2010       2009       2010       2009      (millions)                            Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures                            Unproved Property Acquisition    $ 86     $ 2     $ 294     $ 64     Proved Property Acquisition      (11 )     -       352       -     Exploration      51       22       222       167     Development      459       186       1,096       615     Corporate and Other      23       14       81       87     Total    $ 608     $ 224     $ 2,045     $ 933                                        Increase in FPSO Lease Obligation    $ 80     $ -     $ 188     $ -       2010 Unproved property acquisition costs for the first nine months of 2010 include $38 million of lease bonuses paid on deepwater Gulf of Mexico lease blocks, $146 million related to the DJ Basin asset acquisition, and the remainder for other Northern region, primarily Wattenberg field area, US lease acquisitions. Proved property acquisition costs are the result of the DJ Basin asset acquisition. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.   The obligation under FPSO lease represents the increase in estimated construction in progress to date on an FPSO to be used in the development of the Aseng field in Equatorial Guinea. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt.   In August 2010, we received proceeds of $552 million from the sale of non-core onshore US assets.   2009 Unproved property acquisition costs include primarily lease bonuses on deepwater Gulf of Mexico lease blocks.         37      Table of Contents     Financing Activities Long-Term Debt Our principal source of liquidity is an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures December 9, 2012. The commitment is $2.1 billion until December 9, 2011 at which time the commitment reduces to $1.8 billion. The credit facility (i) provides for credit facility fee rates that range from 5 basis points to 15 basis points per year depending upon our credit rating, (ii) makes available short-term loans up to an aggregate amount of $300 million within the current $2.1 billion commitment and (iii) provides for interest rates that are based upon the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 20 basis points to 70 basis points depending upon our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility. The credit facility is with certain commercial lending institutions and is available for general corporate purposes.   At September 30, 2010, borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaled $350 million, leaving almost $1.75 billion available for use. The weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility at September 30, 2010 was 0.57%. We periodically borrow amounts under provision (ii) above for working capital purposes.   Our outstanding fixed-rate debt totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2010. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 7.73%, with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2097.   Our ratio of debt-to-book capital was 25% at both September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes both long-term debt, excluding unamortized discount, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.   Other Short-Term Borrowings Our committed credit facility may be supplemented by short-term borrowings under various uncommitted credit lines used for working capital purposes. Uncommitted credit lines may be offered by certain banks from time to time at rates negotiated at the time of borrowing. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit lines at September 30, 2010 or December 31, 2009, nor did we borrow any funds under uncommitted credit lines during the first nine months of 2010. Depending upon future credit market conditions, these sources may or may not be available. However, we are not dependent on them to fund our day-to-day operations.   Dividends We paid total cash dividends of 54 cents per share of our common stock during the first nine months of each of 2010 and 2009. On October 26, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per common share, payable November 22, 2010 to shareholders of record on November 8, 2010. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.   Exercise of Stock Options We received cash proceeds of $35 million from the exercise of stock options during the first nine months of 2010 as compared with $15 million during the first nine months of 2009.   Common Stock Repurchases We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 164,515 shares with a value of $12 million during the first nine months of 2010 and 20,464 shares with a value of $1 million during the first nine months of 2009.            38      Table of Contents     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Commodity Price Risk Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.   At September 30, 2010, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps, collars and basis swaps related to crude oil and natural gas sales. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net receivable position with a fair value of $125 million. Based on the September 30, 2010 published commodity futures price strips for the underlying commodities, a hypothetical price increase of $1.00 per Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $13 million. A hypothetical price increase of $0.10 per MMBtu for natural gas would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $7 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 7. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.    Interest Rate Risk  Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.   At September 30, 2010, we had $2.0 billion (excluding the FPSO lease and unamortized discount) of long-term debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.6 billion was fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.73%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss.   The remainder of our long-term debt, $350 million at September 30, 2010, was variable-rate debt drawn under our credit facility. Variable-rate debt exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to increases in market interest rates. We estimate that a hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the September 30, 2010 balance of our variable-rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $1 million.   We occasionally enter into interest rate derivative instruments such as forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate derivative instruments used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At September 30, 2010, AOCL included $93 million, net of tax, related to interest rate derivative instruments. Of this amount, $1 million, net of tax, is currently being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of our 5¼% Senior Notes due April 2014. The remainder ($92 million, net of tax) is related to the change in fair value of an interest rate forward starting swap. Based on the notional amount subject to the interest rate forward starting swap at September 30, 2010, a hypothetical 10% increase in the implied 30-year forward starting swap rate would decrease the fair value of the interest rate derivative liability by approximately $33 million.   See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.   We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances. As of September 30, 2010, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion, approximately 71% of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. A hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the amount invested as of September 30, 2010 would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately $2 million.    Foreign Currency Risk  The US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as foreign deferred tax liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, are denominated in a foreign currency. An increase in exchange rates between the US dollar and the currency of the foreign tax jurisdiction in which these liabilities are located could result in the use of additional cash to settle these liabilities. Transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and are included in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.   We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determined that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.         39      Table of Contents     Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:           ·   our growth strategies;            ·   our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;            ·   anticipated trends in our business;            ·   our future results of operations;            ·   our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;            ·   market conditions in the oil and gas industry;            ·   our ability to make and integrate acquisitions; and            ·   the impact of governmental regulation.      Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors included herein, if any, and included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 are available on our website at www.nobleenergyinc.com.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     Part II. Other Information   Item 1. Legal Proceedings   See Item I. Financial Statements – Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies.   Item 1A. Risk Factors   There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010, or our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, other than the following:   Our operations and investment in Ecuador may be adversely affected by the country's new hydrocarbon reform bill.   A newly enacted hydrocarbon reform bill in Ecuador aims to change current production-sharing arrangements under service contracts and provides that all contracts must be renegotiated by November 23, 2010. It also allows the Ecuadorian government to nationalize oil fields if a private operator does not comply with local laws. We are currently engaged in negotiations with the government. However, we are uncertain as to the potential outcome of this matter, resolution of which could ultimately lead to a reduction in the value of our investments in Ecuador which, as of September 30, 2010, had a net book value of approximately $59 million.         40      Table of Contents     Item 2.
