Item 1A. Risk Factors Our entry into the Marcellus shale through our joint venture with CONSOL will subject us to certain financial, operational and legal obligations and additional risks associated with crude oil and natural gas development activities in that region.   Recent Developments in the Eastern Mediterranean   Cyprus We are currently drilling the Cyprus A-1 exploration well in Block 12, offshore Cyprus. In 1974 the island of Cyprus was partitioned into two parts; the Republic of Cyprus with the majority of the south under its effective control, and the Turkish controlled area in the north, which calls itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and is recognized only by Turkey. The United Nations recognizes the sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island. The Republic of Cyprus has been a member of the European Union since May 1, 2004. The Turkish government opposes the current exploratory activities being conducted by the Republic of Cyprus, claiming it will have a detrimental effect on reunification negotiations, which have been conducted over three decades and are currently being brokered by the United Nations. While Turkey has voiced its opposition to the drilling activity, the European Union, Russia and the US have supported Cyprus' right to drill.   Israel Israel’s diplomatic relations with Turkey and Egypt have been deteriorating. In September 2011, Turkey downgraded diplomatic and trade ties with Israel.   These events have increased the political and social uncertainty in the region; and, at this time, we are uncertain of the outcome of these events. Disruptions caused by territorial or boundary disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the fair values of our properties, resulting in impairment charges. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any losses.   Recent Developments Surrounding the Use of Hydraulic Fracturing and Production from Shale Formations   Hydraulic fracturing is a process commonly used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations, including shale. We find that the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas from many reservoirs, including the DJ Basin. We are in the process of securing additional water rights that will support our DJ Basin drilling program and implementing a pilot water recycling program.   We also expect to use hydraulic fracturing in the development of the Marcellus shale. Our joint development agreement with CONSOL provides us with access to water resources, which we believe will be adequate to execute our development program, and we anticipate the ability to recycle most of the water produced from hydraulic fracturing activities in the Marcellus shale.   As the use of hydraulic fracturing has expanded in recent years, public concern has grown over its possible effects on the environment, including drinking water supplies. We do not believe that properly conducted hydraulic fracturing poses a meaningful risk to water supplies. However, the use of hydraulic fracturing continues to be the subject of controversy in the US where it is often opposed by environmental activists as well as by local citizens in certain areas.   Federal and state rules and regulations governing the reporting and use of hydraulic fracturing continue to evolve. For example, on July 28, 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued proposed rules that would subject all oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants programs. The EPA proposed rules also include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells which would be applicable to newly drilled and fractured wells as well as existing wells that are refractured. Further, the proposed rules include maximum achievable control technology standards for certain equipment not currently subject to such standards. Final action on the proposed rules is expected no later than February 28, 2012.   Earlier in 2011, the US Secretary of Energy formed the Shale Gas Production Subcommittee (Subcommittee), a subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board. The Subcommittee was charged with making recommendations to improve the safety and environmental performance of hydraulic fracturing. On August 18, 2011, the Subcommittee issued its 90-Day Report (Report), which focused exclusively on the production of natural gas (and some liquid hydrocarbons) from shale formations with hydraulic fracturing stimulation in either vertical or horizontal wells. The Subcommittee identified four primary areas of concern including possible water pollution, air pollution, disruption of the community during production, and potential for adverse impact on communities and ecosystems. The Subcommittee also set forth a list of recommendations addressing, among other areas, communications, air quality, protection of water supply and quality, disclosure of fracturing fluid composition, reduction of diesel fuel use, continuous development of best practices, and federal sponsorship of research and development with respect to unconventional gas. The Subcommittee is scheduled to issue a 180-day final report in November 2011. We will continue to monitor the impact the Subcommittee’s recommendations, and any resulting rule-making activities, could have on our exploration and development activities in shale formations.   In June 2011, Texas adopted a law requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process.         27      Table of Contents     We continue to monitor new and proposed legislation to assess the potential impact on our operations. We are currently evaluating the possible impact any proposed rules, such as those described above, could have on our business. Any additional federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay our ability to develop oil and gas reserves.   See Part II. Other Information. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules.   Recent Developments in the Marcellus Shale   On September 7, 2011, an intermediate appellate court (Superior Court) of Pennsylvania issued an opinion in Butler v. Powers regarding the meaning of a deed. As a result, traditional views of how ownership of shale gas is determined in that state have been called into question. The issue is whether shale gas is different from other natural gas and should be considered part of mineral rights, rather than oil and gas rights, because it is contained inside rock. At this time, no case law or interpretation of existing law has changed, nor has there been an indication that either the Superior Court or the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will seek to change existing law. Based upon the limited review performed to date, we believe that any adverse decision in the pending case would have minimal adverse impact upon the assets acquired from CONSOL.   On October 3, 2011, Governor Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania announced his plan for state oversight of the Marcellus shale natural gas industry. His plan includes numerous recommendations recently proposed by the Marcellus Shale Advisory Commission. Standards related to unconventional drilling would include increases in well setback distances, increases in bonding requirements, increases in penalties, expansion of the distance from a well for which a driller can be liable for environmental damage, and broadening of the Department of Environmental Protection’s authority to withhold or revoke permits. The plan also allows for an impact fee, which would be adopted by counties for use by local communities experiencing the actual impacts of drilling. The fee will be used by local governments, counties and state agencies that are involved in Marcellus Shale natural gas drilling. We are monitoring rule-making activities of the Pennsylvania legislature to assess the possible impact any recommendations could have on our business. Enactment of an impact fee and/or other proposals would likely result in a lower rate of return on our development project.   See Part II. Other Information. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our entry into the Marcellus shale through our joint venture with CONSOL will subject us to certain financial, operational and legal obligations and additional risks associated with crude oil and natural gas development activities in that region and Our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules.   Impact of Amendments to Rule 318A   On August 9, 2011, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission approved amendments to The Greater Wattenberg Area Special Well Location Rule 318A (Rule 318A), which addresses oil and gas well drilling, production, commingling and spacing in the Wattenberg field. The amendments, which became effective on October 1, 2011, remove the limit on the number of wells which can produce from a particular formation and address areas such as infill drilling, water sampling and waste management plans. We believe the amendments will enhance our horizontal well drilling program by removing the numerical limitation on wells, allowing wellbore spacing units and permitting wells to cross section lines.   Exploration Program Update   We have significant remaining exploration potential, primarily in the onshore US, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, offshore West Africa, offshore Eastern Mediterranean and other international areas where we hold acreage positions. Significant exploratory wells were in progress at September 30, 2011, and we expect to continue an active exploratory drilling program in fourth quarter 2011. We do not always encounter commercially productive reservoirs through our drilling operations and, as a result, dry hole cost could be significant. Updates of our significant exploration activities are as follows:   DJ Basin (US Onshore) We continue to acquire 3-D seismic information and appraise our acreage in Northern Colorado and Wyoming.   Deep Blue (Deepwater Gulf of Mexico) We obtained approval for a drilling permit and resumed exploratory drilling during third quarter 2011.   Dolphin 1 (Offshore Israel) We are in the process of drilling the Dolphin 1 prospect in the Hanna license, southwest of the Tamar gas field.   Leviathan (Offshore Israel) We are conducting appraisal drilling activities at the Leviathan-3 well.         28      Table of Contents     Cyprus A-1 (Offshore Cyprus) We are in the process of drilling the Cyprus A-1 exploratory well in Block 12.   Major Development Projects Update   During third quarter 2011, we continued to advance our major development projects, which we expect to deliver significant growth over the next several years. Updates on our significant development projects are as follows:   DJ Basin (US Onshore)  We have increased our horizontal drilling activity targeting the Niobrara formation, completing 25 horizontal wells during the quarter. We recently added another drilling rig to our program and are currently running five horizontal drilling rigs.   Marcellus Shale Joint Venture (US Onshore) We are in the process of assuming operatorship of the wet gas areas. There are currently four horizontal rigs operating on the joint venture properties and we expect that an additional rig will be added during fourth quarter 2011. See Part II. Other Information. Item 1A. Risk Factors – Our entry into the Marcellus shale through our joint venture with CONSOL will subject us to certain financial, operational and legal obligations and additional risks associated with crude oil and natural gas development activities in that region.   Galapagos (Deepwater Gulf of Mexico)  Installation of topside equipment at the host facility and subsea tiebacks for the Santa Cruz, Isabela and Santiago wells are progressing. We currently expect production to commence in early 2012.   Gunflint (Deepwater Gulf of Mexico) Once a drilling permit is approved, we plan to conduct appraisal drilling to help define the extent of the reservoir and a potential development scenario.   Aseng (Offshore Equatorial Guinea)   The FPSO sailed for the Aseng field during third quarter and arrived on October 16, 2011. We currently expect production to commence by year end 2011. We have executed an oil sale, purchase, and marketing agreement with Glencore Energy UK Ltd for our share of Aseng production.   Alen (Offshore Equatorial Guinea)   Platform fabrication is underway. We have commenced development drilling and currently expect production to commence by the end of 2013.   Carmen/Diega (Offshore Equatorial Guinea) We are evaluating drilling results and formulating a development plan.   West Africa Gas Project (Offshore Equatorial Guinea)  The Equatorial Guinea Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy is considering the development of an integrated gas project (Integrated project) which includes upstream gas projects, the required gas transportation system, and a second LNG train. A Coordinating Committee was formed to determine the viability and scope of the Integrated project. We have been appointed chair of the Coordinating Committee.   Tamar (Offshore Israel)  Development drilling, platform fabrication and subsea production system installation are underway. Tamar remains on schedule for commissioning beginning in late 2012.   Noa (Offshore Israel) The Noa field will be developed as a subsea tieback to the Mari-B platform. Two development wells have been drilled, FEED (front end engineering and design) work continues, and bid packages are being evaluated. Production is expected to commence in the second half of 2012.   Leviathan (Offshore Israel) We are evaluating potential development scenarios for the Leviathan natural gas discovery and planning pre-FEED activities.   Leviathan-2 Insurance Recoveries   In May 2011, we ended drilling operations at the Leviathan-2 appraisal well location offshore Israel. During the drilling process, we identified water flowing to the sea floor from the wellbore. We are monitoring the wellbore and there are no indications of any hydrocarbons in the produced water.   The incident was a covered event under our well control insurance; therefore, we expect to recover most of the costs from insurance, subject to a deductible. The final amount to be recovered will be based on the cost to drill the Leviathan-3 replacement well down to the same depth at which the incident occurred, possible remediation activities and/or abandonment activities at the Leviathan-2 well, which have not yet been determined, and other factors. As of September 30, 2011, we had recorded a loss on involuntary conversion of $4 million. In addition, we wrote off the net book value of the asset and recorded a corresponding receivable for probable insurance claims of $25 million. We expect to continue to incur costs and submit claims in the normal course of business in 2011 and 2012 and expect the final amount recovered to increase from the current estimate. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Liquidity and Capital Resources – Insurance Recoveries, below.   Asset Impairments   We recorded asset impairment charges of $139 million during the first nine months of 2011 and $100 million during the first nine months of 2010. The impairments were primarily due to field performance and/or a low natural gas price environment. Future decreases in forward natural gas prices or other factors, such as significant increases in development or operating costs or unsatisfactory drilling results, could result in additional impairment charges. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4. Asset Impairments and Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and Potential for Future Asset Impairments, below.         29      Table of Contents     Divestitures   In May 2011, we completed the transfer of our assets in Ecuador to various government-affiliated entities. We received compensation for the offshore Amistad field assets and Block 3 PSC which was terminated by the government of Ecuador on November 25, 2010, as well as for the Machala Power Electricity concession and its associated assets and recorded a gain of approximately $26 million. In August 2010, we closed the sale of certain non-core assets in the Mid-Continent and Illinois Basin areas for sales proceeds of $552 million and recorded a gain of $114 million on the sale. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.   Sales Volumes   On a BOE basis, total sales volumes were 3% lower third quarter 2011 as compared with third quarter 2010, and our mix of sales volumes was 37% global liquids, 36% international natural gas, and 27% US natural gas. International sales volumes were higher in Equatorial Guinea, due to more liftings, and Israel. US production decreased slightly year to year due to sales of mature, non-core properties in 2010. Our volumes for third quarter 2011 did not include natural gas in Ecuador, where our PSC was terminated in late 2010. In addition, we have suspended spot sales of natural gas from the Mari-B field in Israel in order to assure adequate supply to our customers under long-term sales contracts. See Results of Operations – Revenues, below.   Commodity Price Changes and Hedging   Average realized crude oil prices for third quarter 2011 increased 34% as compared with third quarter 2010 and were driven by stronger global crude oil markets.   Total average realized natural gas prices for third quarter 2011 increased 14% as compared with third quarter 2010 primarily due to higher international natural gas pricing.   We have hedged approximately 49% of our expected global crude oil production and 56% of our expected domestic natural gas production for the remainder of 2011.   OPERATING OUTLOOK   Our expected crude oil, natural gas and NGL production for 2011 may be impacted by several factors including:           ·   overall level and timing of capital expenditures which, as discussed below and dependent upon our drilling success, are expected to maintain our near-term production volumes;            ·   timing of major development project completion and initial production;            ·   ongoing development activity in the Wattenberg area and horizontal drilling in the Niobrara formation in the DJ Basin;            ·   ramp-up of development activity in the Marcellus shale;            ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas of our US operations and in the North Sea;            ·   variations in sales volumes of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea related to potential downtime at the methanol, LPG and/or LNG plants;            ·   Israeli demand for electricity which affects demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation, market growth and competing deliveries of natural gas from Egypt;            ·   variations in North Sea sales volumes due to potential FPSO downtime and timing of liftings;            ·   potential hurricane-related volume curtailments in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas;            ·   potential winter storm-related volume curtailments in the Rocky Mountain and/or Marcellus shale areas of our US operations;            ·   potential pipeline and processing facility capacity constraints in the Rocky Mountain and/or Marcellus shale areas of our US operations; and            ·   potential purchases of producing properties and/or divestments of non-core operating assets.      2011 Capital Investment Program    Our 2011 capital program is expected to total approximately $3.0 billion, excluding our Marcellus shale joint venture acquisition costs. The capital program includes approximately $110 million for planned development in our new Marcellus shale core area during the remainder of 2011. We expect to accrue approximately $70 million for the Aseng FPSO lease obligation during 2011. We expect to contribute approximately $12 million in 2011 to CONE Gathering LLC to fund our share of the work program.   We expect that the 2011 capital investment program will be funded from cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and/or other financing such as our issuance of long-term debt in first quarter 2011. See Liquidity and Capital Resources.         30      Table of Contents     We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the year based on the following factors, among others:           ·   commodity prices;            ·   cash flows from operations;            ·   operating and development costs and possible inflationary pressures;            ·   permitting activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico;            ·   potential changes in the fiscal regimes of the US and other countries in which we operate;            ·   impact of implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business practices, including, among others, requirements regarding the posting of cash collateral in hedging transactions;            ·   drilling results;            ·   property acquisitions and divestitures; and            ·   potential legislative or regulatory changes regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing.      Current Global Economic Situation, Changes in Fiscal Regimes and Market Regulations   The recovery from the global financial crisis has been slow and uneven. In the past few months various events, including the US debt downgrade, the European debt crisis, slower GDP growth rates, and reduced consumer demand, have increased economic uncertainty. Many governments are facing demands to increase social spending. Increased spending on public entitlement and/or economic stimulus programs, coupled with a reduced tax base, has resulted in significant budget deficits in many countries. Against this backdrop, global commodity prices have recovered significantly.   In order to address negative fiscal situations and initiate deficit reduction measures, many governments are seeking additional revenue sources, including increases in government take from oil and gas projects. Recently, the President of the United States proposed the American Jobs Act of 2011 (American Jobs Act). The American Jobs Act contains various measures, including tax increases and other revenue-raising proposals, designed to reduce the federal deficit by $3 trillion. Certain proposals, if enacted, would eliminate key US federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies including: the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. In addition, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, a panel established by the recent Budget Control Act of 2011, is charged with recommending at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reductions by November 23, 2011.   Future economic and political changes in the US or other countries in which we operate could result in governments enacting additional taxes and/or other market interventions, which could be detrimental to oil and gas companies. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.   During the first nine months of 2011, fiscal regime changes occurred in both Israel and the UK.   Israel  In March 2011, the Israeli government enacted the Oil Profits Taxation Law, 2011, which imposes additional income tax on oil and gas production. The Israeli government also repealed the percentage depletion deduction and made certain changes to the rules for deducting tangible and intangible development costs. We currently expect these changes to increase our 2011 consolidated income tax expense by approximately $25 million and increase our 2011 consolidated effective income tax rate by approximately two percentage points. We expect no remeasurement of our deferred tax assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2010. The impact of these changes is reflected in our balance sheet and results of operations at September 30, 2011.   The change in Israel’s fiscal regime may negatively impact our future operations by reducing future project profitability, as compared with profitability under the previous fiscal regime, and potentially reducing the economic attractiveness of exploration activities.   UK  Also in March 2011, the UK government announced that the Finance Bill 2011 will increase the rate of the Supplementary Charge levied on oil and gas income in the UK from 20% to 32% effective March 24, 2011. This change became law on July 19, 2011. We expect the change will increase the tax rate on our UK oil and gas income from 50% to 62%, resulting in an increase of approximately $54 million in our 2011 consolidated income tax expense and an increase in our 2011 consolidated effective income tax rate by approximately four percentage points. The estimated increases in our consolidated income tax expense and effective income tax rate include the impact of remeasuring our UK deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2010 to reflect the higher effective rate. During third quarter 2011, we recorded an increase in both our deferred income tax liability and deferred income tax expense of $34 million. The impact of these changes is reflected in our balance sheet and results of operations at September 30, 2011.   See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 13. Income Taxes.   Israeli Interministerial Committee The Israeli Interministerial Committee to Examine Government Policy on Israel’s Natural Gas Economy (Interministerial Committee) has been charged with the task of proposing a government policy for developing the natural gas economy in Israel. Objectives include ensuring energy security for the economy, encouraging competition among various sectors in the local economy, and generating economic and political benefits for Israel. Among other things, the Interministerial Committee will examine the best policy for safeguarding reserves to provide for local consumption and for exporting natural gas. The Interministerial Committee is expected to present its recommendations by February 29, 2012. We are monitoring the activities of the Interministerial Committee to assess the possible impact any recommendations could have on our business.         31      Table of Contents     Potential for Future Asset Impairments   The domestic natural gas market remains weak. A decrease in forward natural gas prices for the remainder of 2011 could result in significant impairment charges. Our Piceance basin (western Colorado), Shattuck (western Oklahoma), and Bowdoin (north central Montana) properties have significant natural gas reserves and therefore are sensitive to declines in natural gas prices. These assets, which have a combined net book value of approximately $1.0 billion at September 30, 2011, are at risk of impairment if future NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas prices experience further decline. The cash flow model that we use to assess proved properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as management’s estimates of future oil and gas production and commodity prices, market outlook on forward commodity prices, operating and development costs, and discount rates. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date of estimate. However, a decrease in forward natural gas prices alone could result in a significant impairment for our properties that are sensitive to declines in natural gas prices. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4. Asset Impairments.   Risk and Insurance Program   Our business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration, production, gathering, processing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including hurricanes, blowouts, well cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons. As protection against financial loss resulting from many, but not all of these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including certain physical damage, business interruption (loss of production), employer’s liability, comprehensive general liability and worker’s compensation insurance. We maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice and we regularly review our potential risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and revise our insurance program accordingly.   For example, in certain international locations (including Equatorial Guinea and Israel) we carry business interruption insurance for loss of revenue arising from physical damage to our facilities caused by fire and natural disasters. The coverage is subject to customary deductibles, waiting periods and recovery limits.   In the Gulf of Mexico, we self-insure for windstorm exposure. Our Gulf of Mexico assets are primarily subsea operations; therefore, our windstorm exposure is limited. In addition, the cost of windstorm insurance continues to be very expensive and coverage amounts are limited. We believe it is more cost-effective for us to self-insure these assets. As a result, we are responsible for substantially all windstorm-related damages to our Gulf of Mexico assets.   In accordance with industry practice, oil and gas well owners generally indemnify drilling rig contractors against certain risks, such as those arising from property and environmental losses, pollution from sources such as oil spills, or contamination resulting from well blowout or fire or other uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons. Most of our domestic and international drilling contracts contain such indemnification clauses. In addition, oil and gas well owners typically assume all costs of well control in the event of an uncontrolled well. We currently carry insurance protection for our net share of any potential financial losses occurring as a result of events such as the Deepwater Horizon Incident. This protection consists of $500 million of well control, pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage and $326 million of additional pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage, which also covers third party personal injury and death. Consequently, if we were to experience an accident similar to the Deepwater Horizon Incident, our total insurance for cleanup and consequential damages would cover a gross loss of $826 million, subject to reduction for claims related to well control and third party damages.   We expect the future availability and cost of insurance will be impacted by the Japanese earthquake and subsequent tsunami as well as by the Deepwater Horizon Incident. Impacts could include tighter underwriting standards, limitations on scope and amount of coverage, and higher premiums, and will depend, in part, on future changes in laws and regulations regarding exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, including possible increases in liability caps for claims of damages from oil spills. We anticipate that current changes in the types of coverage available in the insurance market will result in lower effective coverages and/or the incurrence of higher premiums to achieve past levels of coverage.   During 2010, various Congressional committees began pursuing legislation to increase or remove liability caps for deepwater drilling. The current $75 million liability limit under the Oil Pollution Act may be materially increased or lifted in its entirety. Such a requirement would ultimately require a company to maintain either a much higher level of insurance coverage than was standard for the industry in the past, or a financial position large enough that a company could settle its own damage claims. We anticipate that, at a minimum, less insurance coverage will be available and at a higher cost. We continue to monitor the legislative and regulatory response to the Deepwater Horizon Incident and its impact on the insurance market and our overall risk profile. Accordingly, we may adjust our risk and insurance program to provide protection at insured levels that reflect our perception of the cost of risk relative to frequency and severity of the exposure.   Deepwater drilling entails inherent risks. We have a risk assessment program that analyzes safety and environmental hazards and establishes procedures, work practices, training programs and equipment requirements, including monitoring and maintenance rules, for continuous improvement. We have a strong safety performance record and continue to manage our risks and operations such that the likelihood of a significant accident or spill is remote. However, if an event occurs that is not covered by insurance or not fully protected by insured limits, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.         32      Table of Contents     Oil Spill Response Preparedness   We maintain membership in Clean Gulf Associates (CGA), a nonprofit association of production and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. On behalf of its membership, CGA has contracted with Helix Energy Solutions Group (HESG) for the provision of subsea intervention, containment, capture and shut-in capacity for deepwater Gulf of Mexico exploration wells. The system, known as the Helix Fast Response System (HFRS), at full production capacity, can process up to 55 MBbl/d of oil, 70 MBbl/d of liquids and 95 MMcf/d of natural gas, at 10,000 pounds per square inch (psi) in water depths to 10,000 feet. The containment resources also include a 15,000 psi-gauge intervention capping stack designed to handle extremely high-pressure, deeper wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.

This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given commodity price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas is significantly less than the price for a barrel of oil.        (2)  Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.       (3)   Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea. See Income from Equity Method Investees below.         (4)    Average realized crude oil and condensate prices reflect reductions of $1.25 per Bbl for third quarter 2010 and $1.31 per Bbl for the first nine months of 2010 from hedging activities.            34      Table of Contents     Average realized natural gas prices reflect a reduction of $0.01 per Mcf for the first nine months of 2010 from hedging activities. The average realized natural gas price for the third quarter of 2010 was not impacted by hedging activities, as the net deferred amounts reclassified from AOCL were de minimis.   The price reductions resulted from hedge gains/losses that were previously deferred in AOCL. All hedge gains or losses had been reclassified to revenues by December 31, 2010.       (5)   Our Block 3 PSC was terminated by the Ecuadorian government on November 25, 2010. Intercompany natural gas sales for 2010 were eliminated for accounting purposes. Electricity sales (through May 2011) are included in other revenues. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.      If the realized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, which are included in (gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations, had been included in oil and gas revenues, the effect on average realized prices would have been as follows:            Commodity Price Increase (Decrease)          2011       2010          Crude Oil &  Condensate       Natural  Gas       Crude Oil &  Condensate       Natural  Gas          (Per Bbl)       (Per Mcf)       (Per Bbl)       (Per Mcf)      Three Months Ended September 30,                            United States    $ (1.23 )     .79     $ 0.86     $ 0.87     Equatorial Guinea      -       -       (2.09 )     -     Total Consolidated Operations      (.77 )     .34       0.27       0.41     Total Operations      (.74 )     .34       0.26       0.41                                        Nine Months Ended September 30,                                    United States    $ (3.52 )     .74     $ 0.16     $ 0.63     Equatorial Guinea      -       -       (1.86 )     -     Total Consolidated Operations      (2.10 )     .34       (0.22 )     0.32     Total Operations      (2.04 )     .34       (0.21 )     0.32        An analysis of revenues from sales of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs is as follows:            Sales Revenues          Crude Oil &  Condensate       Natural  Gas       NGLs       Total      (millions)                            Three Months Ended September, 2010    $ 446     $ 214     $ 44     $ 704     Changes due to                                    Increase (Decrease) in Sales Volumes      (30 )     4       8       (18 )   Increase in Sales Prices Before Hedging      134       31       18       183     Change in Amounts Reclassified from AOCL      5       -       -       5     Three Months Ended September 30, 2011    $ 555     $ 249     $ 70     $ 874                                        Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010    $ 1,313     $ 646     $ 143     $ 2,102     Changes due to                                    Increase (Decrease) in Sales Volumes      (46 )     40       17       11     Increase (Decrease) in Sales Prices Before Hedging      439       (4 )     36       471     Change in Amounts Reclassified from AOCL      14       1       -       15     Niine Months Ended September 30, 2011    $ 1,720     $ 683     $ 196     $ 2,599        Crude oil and condensate sales – Revenues from crude oil and condensate sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 as compared with 2010 due to the following:           ·   increases in average realized prices;            ·   higher sales volumes in the DJ Basin attributable to the continued acceleration of our vertical and horizontal drilling programs in Wattenberg;            ·   higher sales volumes attributable to the Central DJ Basin asset acquisition that closed in March 2010; and            ·   higher sales volumes in Equatorial Guinea due to a higher number of liftings;            35      Table of Contents     partially offset by:           ·   decreases in sales volumes from the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas due to natural field decline;            ·   a decrease in onshore US volumes due to the sale of certain Oklahoma and Illinois Basin assets in 2010; and            ·   a decrease in North Sea volumes due to downtime in the Dumbarton field for FPSO maintenance.      Revenues from crude oil and condensate sales included deferred losses of $5 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $14 million for the first nine months of 2010 reclassified from AOCL related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges. As of December 31, 2010, there were no further amounts related to commodity derivative instruments remaining to be reclassified from AOCL to crude oil revenues.   Natural gas sales – Revenues from natural gas sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 as compared with 2010 due to the following:           ·   higher natural gas prices during third quarter 2011 primarily due to increases in sales prices in Israel which benefit from strong global liquids markets;            ·   an increase in Israel sales volumes due to an increase in demand for our natural gas driven by higher electricity production and lower levels of competitor natural gas imports from Egypt;            ·   higher sales volumes in the DJ Basin attributable to the continued acceleration of our vertical and horizontal drilling programs in the Wattenberg area ;            ·   higher sales volumes attributable to the Central DJ Basin asset acquisition that closed in March 2010; and            ·   higher sales volumes in Equatorial Guinea as compared with the first nine months of 2010, during which time the Alba field experienced a planned shut-down for facilities maintenance and repair;      partially offset by:           ·   a decrease in onshore US sales volumes due to the sale of certain Oklahoma and Illinois Basin assets in 2010; and            ·   decreases in sales volumes from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent areas due to natural field decline.      Revenues from natural gas sales included a deferred loss of $1 million for the first nine months of 2010 reclassified from AOCL related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges. Revenues for the third quarter of 2010 included de minimis amounts reclassified from AOCL. As of December 31, 2010, there were no further amounts related to commodity derivative instruments remaining to be reclassified from AOCL to natural gas revenues.   NGL sales – Most of our US NGL production is from the Wattenberg area and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. NGL sales revenues increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 as compared with 2010 due to higher realized prices and a slight increase in sales volumes due to ongoing development activity in the Wattenberg area.   Income from Equity Method Investees We have a 45% interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC, which owns and operates a methanol plant and related facilities and a 28% interest in Alba Plant LLC, which owns and operates a liquefied petroleum gas processing plant. Both plants are located onshore on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea. Equity method investments are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets, our share of earnings is reported as income from equity method investees in our consolidated statements of operations, and our share of dividends is reported within cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.   The increase in income from equity method investees for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 as compared with 2010 was due to increases in average realized condensate, LPG and methanol prices due to global economic recovery, and increases in methanol sales volumes. Condensate and LPG sales volumes and average realized prices are included in the average daily sales volumes and average realized sales prices table above.   Methanol sales volumes and prices were as follows:            Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,          2011       2010       2011       2010      Methanol Sales Volumes (Mmgal)      41       33       119       102     Methanol Sales Prices (per gallon)    $ 1.08     $ 0.84     $ 1.04     $ 0.84        Other Revenues Other revenues include electricity sales and other revenues from operating activities.

Oil and gas exploration expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 included the following:           ·   dry hole cost associated with exploratory drilling in the US Rocky Mountain area and offshore Senegal and Guinea-Bissau;            ·   acquisition of seismic information for Wattenberg, Rocky Mountain and deepwater Gulf of Mexico areas in the US, offshore Nicaragua, offshore France, and offshore Cyprus; and            ·   staff expense associated with new ventures offshore Nicaragua and offshore France.            38      Table of Contents     Oil and gas exploration expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 included the following:           ·   US dry hole cost associated with the Double Mountain exploration well in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico;            ·   acquisition of seismic information in the US in support of Central Gulf of Mexico lease sales and in West Africa for Cameroon;             ·   and staff expense associated with new ventures.      Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD&A expense was as follows:             Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2011       2010       2011       2010      DD&A Expense (millions) (1)    $ 225     $ 231     $ 681     $ 662     Unit Rate per BOE (2)    $ 11.30     $ 11.35     $ 11.84     $ 11.64            (1)   For DD&A expense by geographical area, see Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 15. Segment Information.           (2)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.       Total DD&A expense for the first nine months of 2011 increased as compared with 2010 due to the following:           ·   higher DD&A expense in the Wattenberg area of our onshore US operations due to higher sales volumes resulting from ongoing capital spending;            ·   higher DD&A expense in Equatorial Guinea due to higher sales volumes; and            ·   higher DD&A expense in China due to higher costs associated with development activities;       partially offset by:           ·   lower DD&A expense in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast, and Mid-Continent areas of our US operations due to lower sales volumes resulting from natural field decline; and            ·   the cessation of DD&A associated with certain Oklahoma and Illinois Basin assets sold during 2010.      Changes in the unit rate per BOE for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 as compared with 2010 were due to changes in the mix of production. For example, sales volumes from Equatorial Guinea and Israel have lower DD&A rates.   General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2011       2010       2011       2010      G&A Expense (millions)    $ 89     $ 65     $ 254     $ 194     Unit Rate per BOE (1)    $ 4.45     $ 3.20     $ 4.41     $ 3.42            (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.      G&A expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 increased as compared with 2010 primarily due to additional expenses relating to personnel, office, and information technology costs in support of our major development projects and increased exploration activities.

Interest expense increased for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 as compared with 2010. The increase in interest expense resulted from a higher outstanding debt balance during the period and the interest associated with our 6% senior unsecured notes issued in first quarter 2011. The higher rate on the senior unsecured notes replaced the substantially lower rate applicable to our revolving credit facility which was repaid with proceeds from our debt offering. See also Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities below.   The increase in the amount of interest capitalized is due to higher work in progress amounts related to major long-term projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and Israel and a higher weighted average interest rate associated with our 6% senior unsecured notes, which impacted the average rate we pay on long-term debt.   Other Non-operating (Income) Expense, Net Other non-operating (income) expense, net includes deferred compensation (income) expense, interest income and other (income) expense. See Item 1.

Income Taxes for a discussion of the change in our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2011 as compared with 2010.         40      Table of Contents     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Capital Structure/Financing Strategy   In seeking to effectively fund and monetize our major development projects, we employ a capital structure and financing strategy designed to provide ample liquidity throughout the commodity price cycle. Specifically, we strive to retain the ability to fund long cycle, multi-year, capital intensive development projects while also maintaining the capability to execute a robust exploration program and financially attractive periodic mergers and acquisitions activity. We endeavor to maintain an investment grade debt rating in service of these objectives. We also utilize a commodity price hedging program to reduce commodity price uncertainty and enhance the predictability of cash flows along with a risk and insurance program to protect against disruption to our cash flows and operations.   Traditional sources of our liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. Occasional sales of non-strategic crude oil and natural gas properties as well as our periodic access to capital markets may also generate cash.   Our financial capacity, coupled with our balanced and diversified portfolio, provides us with flexibility in our investment decisions including execution of our major development projects and increased exploration activity.   Marcellus Shale Joint Venture On September 30, 2011 we closed a joint venture partnership arrangement with a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, Inc. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 5. Debt.   The transaction is structured in a unique way from a financial perspective. We have spread the payment over a three-year period, beginning at closing. The $2.1 billion CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation is expected to extend over an eight-year period and is capped at $400 million in each calendar year and will be suspended if average Henry Hub natural gas prices fall and remain below $4.00 per MMBtu in any three consecutive month period and will remain suspended until average Henry Hub natural gas prices are above $4.00 per MMBtu for three consecutive months. These conditions allow us to integrate a new core area into our existing long range plan while maintaining our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility. We funded the initial cash payment with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility and expect to fund the remaining installment payments and CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation with cash on hand and our credit facility. Targeted divestments of non-core assets may also be a source of funding.   Available Liquidity Information regarding cash and debt balances was as follows:            September 30,       December 31,          2011       2010      (millions, except percentages)                Cash and Cash Equivalents    $ 1,252     $ 1,081     Amount Available to be Borrowed Under Credit Facility (1)      1,700       1,750     Total Liquidity    $ 2,952     $ 2,831                        Total Debt (2)    $ 3,891     $ 2,279     Total Shareholders' Equity      7,582       6,848     Ratio of Debt-to-Book Capital (3)      34 %     25 %           (1)   See Credit Facility below.           (2)   Total debt includes FPSO lease obligation and remaining CONSOL installment payments and excludes unamortized debt discount.          (3)   We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes long-term debt excluding unamortized discount, the current portion of long-term debt, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.      Cash and Cash Equivalents We had approximately $1.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2011, primarily denominated in US dollars and invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. Approximately $986 million of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries. We currently intend to use our international cash to fund international programs, including the planned developments in Equatorial Guinea and Israel. At September 30, 2011, we believe that sufficient liquidity is available in the US to fund our planned domestic programs. We currently do not expect to need additional foreign funds for US working capital or investment purposes. However, we have the ability to repatriate additional funds if we desire to do so. Any foreign cash repatriated would likely be subject to additional US income taxes and could result in an increase in our tax liability, after considering available foreign tax credits and/or other tax attributes.   Credit Facility At September 30, 2011, we had an unsecured revolving credit facility that was due to mature December 9, 2012. The commitment was $2.1 billion until December 9, 2011, at which time the commitment would reduce to $1.8 billion. We borrowed $400 million under the credit facility in order to finance the Marcellus shale property acquisitions, and ended third quarter 2011 with $1.7 billion remaining available for borrowing. On October 14, 2011, we terminated the existing $2.1 billion credit facility and entered into a Credit Agreement which provides for a new $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due October 14, 2016. See Financing Activities New Credit Facility below.         41      Table of Contents     Derivative Instruments  We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs. Such instruments include variable to fixed price commodity swaps, two and three-way collars and basis swaps. Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. If actual commodity prices are higher than the fixed or ceiling prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be lower than if we had no derivative instruments. Conversely, if actual commodity prices are lower than the fixed or floor prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be higher than if we had no derivative instruments. None of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements. We also use derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk by entering into forward contracts or swap agreements to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with fixed or floating rate borrowings.   Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of September 30, 2011 the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $131 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $6 million (after consideration of netting agreements). See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for a discussion of counterparty credit risk and Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of derivative instruments.   Insurance Recoveries In May 2011, we ended drilling operations at the Leviathan-2 appraisal well location offshore Israel. The incident was a covered event under our well control insurance. At this time, we expect to recover most of the costs from insurance, subject to a deductible. We do not expect any delays in the insurance claim recovery process to have a significant impact on our cash flows or liquidity. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Leviathan-2 Insurance Recoveries, above.   Contractual Obligations   The following table updates certain contractual obligations from amounts reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts are net to our interest:                                         Obligation     Total       2011       2012 and 2013       2014 and 2015       2016 and beyond      (millions)                                  Long-Term Debt (Excluding Interest) (1)    $ 3,540     $ -     $ 1,056     $ 200     $ 2,284     Cash Payments for Interest (2)      3,091       19       374       339       2,359     CONE Gathering LLC MARC (3)      26       3       23       -       -     FPSO Lease Payments (4)      496       12       144       142       198             (1)   Long-term debt excludes our FPSO lease obligation. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Debt.         (2)   Cash payments for interest are based on the total debt balance, scheduled maturities and interest rates in effect at September 30, 2011.        (3)   Represents minimum annual revenue commitments. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.        (4)   The FPSO arrived at the Aseng field offshore Equatorial Guinea on October 16, 2011. Annual lease payments, net to our interest, exclude regular maintenance and operational costs, and will begin when the FPSO initiates producing operations. These payments are also subject to change based on change orders implemented during the construction period, final accounting treatment, and other factors. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Debt.      CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation The CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation represents our agreement to fund up to approximately $2.1 billion of CONSOL’s future drilling and completion costs. The CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation is expected to extend over an eight-year period. It is capped at $400 million in each calendar year and will be suspended if average Henry Hub natural gas prices fall and remain below $4.00 per MMBtu in any three consecutive month period and will remain suspended until average Henry Hub natural gas prices are above $4.00 per MMBtu for three consecutive months. Therefore, specific payment dates for the funding of the CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation cannot be determined at this time. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 5. Debt.   Cash Flows   Cash flow information is as follows:            Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2011       2010      (millions)                Total Cash Provided By (Used in)                Operating Activities    $ 1,785     $ 1,452     Investing Activities      (2,383 )     (1,232 )   Financing Activities      769       (85 )   Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents    $ 171     $ 135              42      Table of Contents     Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2011 increased as compared with 2010 primarily due to higher revenues, which benefitted from increases in commodity prices. The increase in cash flow was partially offset by increases in general and administrative expense and interest expense. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   Investing Activities Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method. These investing activities may be offset by proceeds from property sales or dispositions. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment increased by $542 million during the first nine months of 2011 as compared with 2010, primarily due to our increased major project development activity in the Wattenberg area, offshore West Africa, and offshore Israel. We also made an initial investment of $519 in Marcellus shale assets and $73 million in CONE Gathering LLC. Investing activities were offset by $77 million proceeds from divestitures of non-core assets including our Ecuador assets and certain onshore US assets. Additional investing activities for 2010 included $458 million related to the Central DJ Basin asset acquisition, offset by proceeds of $552 million from the sale of non-core onshore US assets.   Financing Activities  Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first nine months of 2011, funds were provided by net cash proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility ($520 million) and the issuance of 6% senior notes ($836 million). Funds were also provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($43 million). We used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility ($470 million). We also used cash to settle an interest rate lock ($40 million), pay dividends on our common stock ($104 million) and repurchase shares of our common stock ($16 million).   In comparison, during the first nine months of 2010, $32 million of funds were provided by net increases in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and used to fund the Central DJ Basin asset acquisition and other capital expenditures. Funds were also provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($54 million). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($95 million) and repurchase shares of our common stock ($12 million).   See Item 1. Financial Statements – Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.   Investing Activities   Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures  Information for investing activities (on an accrual basis) is as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2011       2010       2011       2010      (millions)                            Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures                            Unproved Property Acquisition    $ 826     $ 86     $ 883     $ 294     Proved Property Acquisition      370       (11 )     370       352     Exploration (1)      58       51       286       222     Development      604       459       1,478       1,096     Corporate and Other      40       23       128       81     Total    $ 1,898     $ 608     $ 3,145     $ 2,045     Other                                    Investment in Equity Method Investee    $ 73     $ -     $ 73     $ -     Increase in FPSO Lease Obligation      5       80       56       188             (1)   Amount for three and nine months ended September 30, 2011 is net of probable insurance proceeds totaling $25 million related to our Leviathan -2 appraisal well offshore Israel.       2011 Unproved property acquisition costs include $790 million related to our acquisition of a 50% interest in Marcellus shale undeveloped leases, $40 million related to our position offshore Senegal and Guinea-Bissau (the AGC Profond block), and miscellaneous onshore US lease acquisitions. Proved property acquisition costs include $370 million related to the Marcellus shale. The increase in development costs is due to increased capital spending on major development projects located in the DJ Basin, offshore Equatorial Guinea and offshore Israel.   In connection with the Marcellus shale joint venture, we acquired a 50% interest in CONE Gathering Company LLC for $73 million in cash. CONE Gathering LLC was formed for the purpose of owning and operating the existing gathering assets and constructing, owning and operating all of the additional gathering lines and related facilities that will be needed during the course of the Marcellus shale development and will be accounted for using the equity method.         43      Table of Contents     See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures.   2010 Unproved property acquisition costs included $38 million for lease bonuses paid on deepwater Gulf of Mexico lease blocks, $146 million related to the Central DJ Basin asset acquisition, and the remainder primarily for other onshore US lease acquisitions. Proved property acquisition costs related to the Central DJ Basin asset acquisition.   FPSO Lease Obligation The FPSO lease obligation represents the increase in construction costs to date on the Aseng FPSO to be used in the development of the Aseng field in Equatorial Guinea. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Debt.   Financing Activities   New Credit Facility  On October 14, 2011, we entered into a Credit Agreement which provides for a new $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the New Credit Facility). The New Credit Facility replaces our $2.1 billion credit facility maturing December 9, 2012.   The New Credit Facility (i) provides for an initial commitment of $3.0 billion with an option to increase the overall commitment amount by up to an additional $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of any increasing lenders, (ii) will mature on October 14, 2016, (iii) provides for facility fee rates that range from 12.5 basis points to 30 basis points per year depending upon our credit rating, (iv) includes sub-facilities for short-term loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $500 million under each sub-facility and (iv) provides for interest rates that are based upon the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 100 basis points to 145 basis points depending upon our credit rating.   Also on October 14, 2011, we drew down $400 million under the New Credit Facility, the proceeds of which were utilized to repay outstanding borrowings under and to terminate our existing $2.1 billion credit facility maturing December 9, 2012. After the draw down, $2.6 billion remained available for borrowing under the New Credit Facility.   See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Debt.     CONSOL Installment Payments On September 30, 2011, we closed an agreement with CONSOL under which we agreed to purchase a 50% interest in undeveloped Marcellus shale acreage. In addition to the cash paid at closing, we agreed to make two additional installment payments of $328 million each on September 30, 2012 and 2013. The installment payments have been discounted at the prevailing market rates for similar debt instruments, a weighted average of 1.76%. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 5. Debt.     Public Debt Offering In order to provide increased liquidity and lengthen our weighted average debt maturity, on February 18, 2011, we completed an underwritten public offering of $850 million of 6% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2041, receiving net proceeds of $836 million after deducting discount and underwriting fees. Approximately $470 million of the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility maturing 2012 and the balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.   Fixed-Rate Debt Our outstanding fixed-rate debt, including the remaining CONSOL installment payments, totaled approximately $3.1 billion at September 30, 2011. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 6.01%, with maturities ranging from 2012 to 2097. Approximately 17% of our fixed rate debt matures within the next five years.   FPSO Lease Obligation We have an agreement for the construction and lease of an FPSO to be used for development of the Aseng field, offshore Equatorial Guinea. The FPSO is currently being installed at the Aseng field, and we are including the FPSO lease obligation in our balance sheet based upon the percentage of construction activities completed at the end of each reporting period. The obligation increased $56 million during the first nine months of 2011. We currently expect Aseng production to commence, and lease payments to begin, by year end 2011.   Ratio of Debt-to-Book Capital Our ratio of debt-to-book capital was 34% at September 30, 2011 as compared with 25% at December 31, 2010. We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes long-term debt excluding unamortized discount, the current portion of long-term debt, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.   Other Short-Term Borrowings Our committed credit facility may be supplemented by short-term borrowings under various uncommitted credit lines used for working capital purposes. Uncommitted credit lines may be offered by certain banks from time to time at rates negotiated at the time of borrowing. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit lines at September 30, 2011 or December 31, 2010, nor did we borrow any funds under uncommitted credit lines during the first nine months of 2011. Depending upon future credit market conditions, these sources may or may not be available. However, we are not dependent on them to fund our day-to-day operations.         44      Table of Contents     Dividends We paid total cash dividends of 58 cents per share of our common stock during the first nine months of 2011 and 54 cents per share during the first nine months of 2010. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.   Exercise of Stock Options We received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $32 million during the first nine months of 2011 and $35 million during the first nine months of 2010.   Common Stock Repurchases We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 181,234 shares with a value of $16 million during the first nine months of 2011 and 164,515 shares with a value of $12 million during the first nine months of 2010.          45      Table of Contents     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Commodity Price Risk   Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.   At September 30, 2011, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps, collars and basis swaps related to crude oil and natural gas sales. Changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net receivable position with a fair value of $125 million. Based on the September 30, 2011 published commodity futures price strips for the underlying commodities, a hypothetical price increase of $1.00 per Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $17 million. A hypothetical price increase of $0.10 per MMBtu for natural gas would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $6 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.   Interest Rate Risk   Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.   At September 30, 2011, we had approximately $3.5 billion (excluding the FPSO lease obligation and unamortized debt discount) of long-term debt outstanding. Debt outstanding included $3.1 billion of fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.01%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Debt.   We occasionally enter into interest rate derivative instruments such as forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate derivative instruments used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At September 30, 2011, AOCL included $27 million, net of tax, related to interest rate derivative instruments. This amount is currently being reclassified to earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the terms of our 5¼% senior notes due April 2014 and 6% senior notes due March 1, 2041. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.   We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances. As of September 30, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $1.25 billion, approximately 72% of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. A hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the amount invested as of September 30, 2011 would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately $2 million.    Foreign Currency Risk    The US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as foreign deferred tax liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, are denominated in a foreign currency. A reduction in the value of the US dollar against currencies of other countries in which we have material operations could result in the use of additional cash to settle operating, administrative, and tax liabilities. This risk may be mitigated to the extent commodity prices increase in response to a devaluation of the US dollar.   Transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and are included in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.   We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determine that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.         46      Table of Contents     Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:           ·   our growth strategies;            ·   our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;            ·   anticipated trends in our business;            ·   our future results of operations;            ·   our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;            ·   market conditions in the oil and gas industry;            ·   our ability to make and integrate acquisitions;            ·   the impact of governmental fiscal terms and/or regulation, such as that involving the protection of the environment or marketing of production, as well as other regulations; and            ·   access to resources.      Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors included herein, if any, and included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 is available on our website at www.nobleenergyinc.com.   Item 4. Controls and Procedures   Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   Part II. Other Information   Item 1. Legal Proceedings    Piceance Basin Matter In October 2011, we received a Notice of Alleged Violation (NOAV) from the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (Commission) regarding the reporting of gas analyses indicating the presence of hydrogen sulfide to the Commission and local government designee within certain areas of our Piceance basin operations. At this time, the Commission has not established a proposed penalty for this NOAV. Given the inherent uncertainty in administrative actions of this nature, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this action at this time. However, we believe that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    See Item I. Financial Statements – Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies.   Item 1A. Risk Factors   There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2011 and June 30, 2011, or our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, other than the following:   Our entry into the Marcellus shale through our joint venture with CONSOL will subject us to certain financial, operational and legal obligations and additional risks associated with crude oil and natural gas development activities in that region.   On September 30, 2011 we finalized a joint venture partnership arrangement with CONSOL where, among other things, we have agreed to develop significant acreage in the Marcellus shale. This arrangement represents the entry into a new core area for us in which we have very limited experience. Under the arrangement, we purchased a 50% interest in CONSOL’s undeveloped acreage and have agreed to act as operator on a portion of the acreage. Additionally, we have committed to make significant capital expenditures, consisting primarily of a $2.1 billion Carried Cost Obligation, and have agreed to other operational and legal obligations. If we do not meet our financial commitments or perform our other obligations on a timely basis, our rights to participate in the joint venture, and our anticipated operations in the Marcellus shale, could be adversely affected.         47      Table of Contents     We plan to drill numerous wells in the Marcellus shale over a multi-year period. These activities will be subject to many risks including, among others:           ·   Development drilling in emerging resource plays such as the Marcellus shale may not result in commercially productive quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves;            ·   We have limited exploration and development experience in the Marcellus shale and limited information regarding ultimate recoverable reserves and production decline rates; therefore, our estimates of economically recoverable quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially and actual production, revenue and expenditures with respect to our reserves likely will vary, possibly materially, from estimates;            ·   Our operations in the Marcellus shale will require significant additional attention and we may not be able to attract and retain personnel with the necessary skills to successfully carry out our joint development program;            ·   Our entry into the Marcellus shale will place additional burdens on our financial resources and internal financial controls;            ·   The high level of current and planned development activity in the Marcellus shale may result in increased competition for drilling rigs and oilfield services such as hydraulic fracturing, gathering, processing and/or transportation, thus hindering our ability to develop our reserves and market our production;            ·   Significant activism in New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia against oil and gas development activities, particularly regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing, could, among other things, delay or limit our access to crude oil and natural gas reserves;            ·   Additional environmental regulation or legislation could result in higher development and/or production costs;            ·   Enactment of local impact fees in Pennsylvania, such as recommended by the Marcellus Shale Advisory Committee and supported by the governor of Pennsylvania, a severance tax in Pennsylvania, such as has been proposed by various groups in the past, and /or permit fees for drilling such as adopted by a joint legislative committee in West Virginia, would likely result in a lower rate of return on our development project;            ·   Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations, could hinder our ability to develop our reserves or increase our development and operating costs.      We may not be able to compensate for or fully mitigate these risks.   Our ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules.   The hydraulic fracturing process on which we depend to produce commercial quantities of crude oil and natural gas from many reservoirs, including Wattenberg and the Marcellus shale, require the use and disposal of significant quantities of water.   Our inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations in these regions. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas.   Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.   Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
