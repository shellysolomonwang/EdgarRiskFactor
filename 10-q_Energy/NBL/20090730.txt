Item 1A. Risk Factors), significant decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices could result in a reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. The commodity price decreases that began during the second half of 2008 required us to record asset impairment charges during fourth quarter 2008. Further declines in natural gas prices during first quarter 2009 led us to review those properties that, at year-end 2008, were susceptible to impairment should commodity prices continue to decline appreciably. As a result of this review, we determined that additional properties were impaired as of March 31, 2009. Total pre-tax (non-cash) impairments for first quarter 2009 were $437 million and were predominately related to Granite Wash, an onshore US area in which we have significantly reduced investments beginning in 2007. The decrease in the natural gas futures price strip that occurred during first quarter 2009 was the primary factor that required an impairment of Granite Wash. There were no asset impairments during second quarter 2009. However, further declines in commodity prices could result in additional impairment of our oil and gas properties, other long-lived assets or goodwill. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements.   During second quarter 2009, our operations benefited from the strengthening crude oil market, but sustained lower commodity prices will continue to reduce our cash flows from operations. To mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices on our cash flows, we have entered into crude oil and natural gas commodity contracts for 2009, 2010 and 2011. Depending on the length of the current recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing a prolonged downturn, which would further reduce our cash flows from operations. This could cause us to alter our business plans including reducing or delaying our exploration and development program spending and other cost reduction initiatives. See 2009 Budget below.   We are closely monitoring costs and have implemented several cost savings initiatives, including continued reduction of well costs through drilling and completion efficiencies and comprehensive review of oil and gas operating costs. We are also beginning to see reductions in third party drilling costs and operating supplies and services.   OUTLOOK   Our expected crude oil, natural gas and NGL production for the remainder of 2009 may be impacted by several factors including:           ·   overall level and timing of capital expenditures, as discussed below, which, dependent upon our drilling success, are expected to maintain our near-term production volumes;             ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-continent areas of our US operations and the North Sea;             ·   variations in sales volumes of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea;             ·   potential hurricane-related volume curtailments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas of our US operations as occurred with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008;             ·   timing of the full restoration of pipeline and facilities necessary to increase our Gulf of Mexico production;             ·   potential winter storm-related volume curtailments in the Northern region of our US operations;             ·   potential pipeline and processing facility capacity constraints in the Rocky Mountains area of our US operations;                ·  Israeli demand for electricity which affects demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation, market growth and competing deliveries of natural gas from Egypt;        ·   potential downtime at the methanol, LPG and/or LNG plants in Equatorial Guinea;              ·   seasonal variations in rainfall in Ecuador that affect our natural gas-to-power project; and             ·   timing of significant project completion and initial production.       2009 Budget – Due to the uncertain economic and commodity price environment, we designed a flexible capital spending program that is responsive to conditions that develop during 2009. Our revised capital program for 2009 accommodates an investment level of $1.6 billion, with the ability to adjust up or down by approximately 15%. Currently we are managing towards an investment level of approximately $1.4 billion, the lower end of this range.    Approximately 40% of the 2009 budget is committed to longer-term projects that will provide considerable production growth several years in the future. The remainder is allocated toward maintaining and strengthening the existing property base. Development spending is focused on our international and deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets as well as certain higher return opportunities onshore in the US including the Wattenberg field. The exploration budget is centered on significant resource potential in Israel, West Africa and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. International expenditures are estimated to represent 30% of the total capital program.   The 2009 budget does not include the impact of possible asset purchases. We expect that the remaining 2009 budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We will evaluate the level of capital spending throughout the remainder of the year based on drilling results, commodity prices, cash flows from operations and property acquisitions and divestitures.           26      Table of Contents     Recently Issued Pronouncements – See Item 1.

The price reductions resulted from hedge gains and losses that were previously deferred in AOCL.              28      Table of Contents           (2)    Average realized natural gas prices reflect an increase of $0.01 per Mcf and a reduction of $0.06 per Mcf for second quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and an increase of $0.49 per Mcf for the first six months of 2008 from hedging activities. The price increases and reduction resulted from hedge gains and losses that were previously deferred in AOCL. The average realized natural gas price for the first six months of 2009 was not impacted by hedging activities, as the net deferred gain reclassified from AOCL was de minimis.             (3)    Average realized crude oil and condensate prices reflect reductions of $5.33 per Bbl and $8.20 per Bbl for second quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $6.11 per Bbl and $8.42 per Bbl for the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively, from hedging activities. The price reductions resulted from hedge losses that were previously deferred in AOCL.             (4)    Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant and an LNG plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Natural gas volumes sold to the LNG plant totaled 200 MMcfpd and 175 MMcfpd during second quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and 194 MMcfpd and 174 MMcfpd during the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.             (5)    The natural gas-to-power project in Ecuador is 100% owned by our subsidiaries and intercompany natural gas sales are eliminated for accounting purposes. Electricity sales are included in other revenues. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2 – Basis of Presentation.             (6)    Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea. See Equity Method Investees below.        Crude oil and condensate sales volumes in the table above differ from actual production volumes due to the timing of liquid hydrocarbon tanker liftings.

Decreases in US sales volumes were due to the ongoing impact of shut-ins related to Hurricane Ike in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast area. These decreases were offset somewhat by increases in production in the Northern region.   Internationally, sales remained relatively flat, although North Sea volumes declined due to natural field decline and the timing of liftings.   Revenues included deferred losses of $15 million and $93 million for second quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $32 million and $190 million for the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively, reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges.   Natural Gas Sales – Natural gas sales decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2009 as compared with 2008 primarily due to the significant decrease in average realized prices. In the US, increases in natural gas production from the Wattenberg, Piceance and Tri-state areas were partially offset by the ongoing impact of shut-ins related to Hurricane Ike in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast area.   International volumes also declined overall. In Israel, power plant downtime, an overall decrease in demand and competing natural gas sales from Egypt led to decreased natural gas sales. West Africa sales volumes were higher primarily due to increased natural gas sales to the third-party LNG facility.   Revenues included a deferred loss of $2 million for second quarter 2008 and a deferred gain of $35 million for the first six months of 2008 reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges. Revenues for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 included a de minimis amount reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges.   NGL Sales – Most of our US NGL production is from the Wattenberg field and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. NGL sales decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2009 as compared with 2008 due to the significant decrease in average realized NGL prices.           30      Table of Contents     Equity Method Investees Our share of operations of equity method investees, Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO) and Alba Plant LLC (Alba Plant), was as follows:                Three Months Ended  June 30,       Six Months Ended  June 30,           2009       2008       2009       2008       Net Income (in millions):                             AMPCO and Affiliates    $ 2     $ 17     $ 2     $ 45      Alba Plant      14       39       25       73      Distributions/Dividends (in millions):                                     AMPCO and Affiliates      -       5       -       39      Alba Plant      5       40       5       82      Sales Volumes:                                     Methanol (MMgal)      41       36       76       70      Condensate (MBopd)      2       2       2       2      LPG (MBpd)      6       7       6       7      Production Volumes:                                     Methanol (MMgal)      29       31       68       63      Condensate (MBopd)      2       2       2       2      LPG (MBpd)      6       6       6       6      Average Realized Prices:                                     Methanol (per gallon)    $ 0.49     $ 1.15     $ 0.47     $ 1.38      Condensate (per Bbl)      56.12       118.95       50.38       107.01      LPG (per Bbl)      30.12       69.70       28.38       65.50             The decrease in net income for each of the equity method investees for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 as compared with 2008 was due to significant decreases in average realized prices. In addition, during second quarter 2009 and 2008, AMPCO experienced downtime for refractory repairs and drew down inventory to meet customer demand. The decreases in Alba Plant distributions during the second quarter and first six months of 2009 were due to the decreases in net income and in anticipation of planned tax payments.   Other Revenues Other revenues include electricity sales and GMP revenues. See Item 1.

(2)   Oil and gas operating costs include labor, fuel, repairs, replacements, saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs.       Total production costs for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 decreased as compared with 2008. The largest decrease was in production and ad valorem taxes, which declined due to reduced proceeds from production attributable to lower commodity prices in the US and China and the cessation of production due to the sale of our interest in Argentina. US oil and gas operating costs increased due to an increase in well count, higher salt water disposal costs in the Northern region and higher insurance expense. North Sea oil and gas operating costs decreased due to lower sales volumes (timing of liftings).           32      Table of Contents     Selected expenses on a per BOE basis were as follows:                Three Months Ended  June 30,       Six Months Ended  June 30,           2009       2008       2009       2008       Oil and Gas Operating Costs    $ 4.88     $ 4.23     $ 4.99     $ 4.05      Workover and Repair Expense      0.29       0.42       0.35       0.38      Lease Operating Expense      5.17       4.65       5.34       4.43      Production and Ad Valorem Taxes      1.29       2.67       1.14       2.45      Transportation Expense      0.73       0.81       0.68       0.74      Total Production Costs (1) (2)    $ 7.19     $ 8.13     $ 7.16     $ 7.62                 (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $1.45 per BOE and $1.32 per BOE for second quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $1.38 per BOE and $1.21 per BOE for the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.           (2)   Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of oil equivalent.

Oil and gas exploration expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 decreased primarily due to lower dry hole expense. Dry hole expense for the second quarter of 2009 related to an unsuccessful exploratory well drilled in the Northern region of our US operations. Dry hole expense for 2008 was due primarily to an exploration well offshore Suriname and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico which did not encounter hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. US seismic expense for 2009 and 2008 represents seismic expense incurred in support of the annual central Gulf of Mexico lease sales.           33      Table of Contents      Exploration expense also includes stock-based compensation expense of $2 million and $1 million for second quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $5 million and $1 million for the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.   Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization – DD&A expense was as follows:                 Three Months Ended  June 30,     Six Months Ended  June 30,           2009       2008       2009       2008           (in millions, except unit rate)       DD&A Expense    $ 192     $ 194     $ 389     $ 395      Accretion of Discount on Asset Retirement Obligations      4       2       7       4      Total DD&A Expense    $ 196     $ 196     $ 396     $ 399      Unit Rate per BOE (1)    $ 10.88     $ 10.30     $ 10.95     $ 10.36                  (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $1.82 per BOE and $1.34 per BOE for second quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $1.75 and $1.32 per BOE for the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.       Total DD&A expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 was flat as compared with 2008. DD&A expense for the Wattenberg, Rocky Mountain, and Mid-continent areas of our Northern region increased due to higher production in the Piceance basin, higher capital spending necessary to complete these projects, and negative reserve revisions related to lower year-end 2008 commodity prices. These increases were offset by decreases in DD&A expense due to lower sales volumes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, North Sea and Israel. See Oil, Gas and NGL Sales above. DD&A expense included $4 million abandoned asset expense during the first six months of 2009 and higher accretion expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2009.   The unit rate per BOE increased for both the second quarter and first six months of 2009 as compared with 2008 due to the change in mix of production, including a reduction in Israel sales volumes (which have a lower DD&A rate), and higher capital spending and negative reserve revisions in the Northern region, as described above.   General and Administrative Expense – General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows:                Three Months Ended  June 30,       Six Months Ended  June 30,           2009       2008       2009       2008                                   G&A Expense (in millions)    $ 60     $ 61     $ 119     $ 121      Unit Rate per BOE (1)    $ 3.35     $ 3.21     $ 3.29     $ 3.15                 (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $0.68 per BOE and $0.52 per BOE for second quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively and $0.63 per BOE and $0.50 per BOE for the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.       G&A expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2009 remained flat. It included stock-based compensation expense of $9 million and $10 million for the second quarter of 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $17 million and $19 million for the first six months of 2009 and 2008, respectively. The unit rate per BOE for the second quarter and first six months of 2009 increased as compared with 2008 due to lower sales volumes.   Asset Impairments – During first quarter 2009 we recorded total pre-tax (non-cash) impairment charges of $437 million on certain US oil and gas properties, primarily due to lower natural gas prices. In determining the fair values of the impaired properties, we applied the principles of fair value measurements as defined by US GAAP. These principles require that fair values be determined from the perspective of a market participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, multiple valuation techniques, the most advantageous market and assumptions around the highest and best use of the assets.           34      Table of Contents     Due to the absence of comparable market data for the impaired properties, we estimated the fair values using a discounted cash flow method. Estimated future cash flows were based on management’s expectations for the future and included management’s estimates of future oil and gas production, commodity prices based on published commodity futures price strips as of March 31, 2009, operating and development costs, as well as appropriate discount rates. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, the fair values of the impaired properties were classified as Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. A change in any of the assumptions used, such as a significant increase or decrease in estimated commodity prices or production, could have had a significant impact on the amount of the impairment loss recognized. There were no asset impairments during second quarter 2009. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements.   Other Operating Expense, Net – Other operating expense, net includes electricity generation expense and GMP expense. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2 – Basis of Presentation.   Loss on Commodity Derivative Instruments – See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements.   Interest Expense and Capitalized Interest – Interest expense and capitalized interest were as follows:                 Three Months Ended  June 30,       Six Months Ended  June 30,           2009       2008       2009       2008           (in millions)       Interest Expense    $ 35     $ 23     $ 59     $ 49      Capitalized Interest      (12 )     (6 )     (18 )     (15 )    Interest Expense, net    $ 23     $ 17     $ 41     $ 34              Interest expense increased $12 million for second quarter 2009 and $10 million for the first six months of 2009, as compared with 2008. The increase in interest expense primarily relates to our $1 billion 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019, which we issued on February 27, 2009. This increase was partially offset by a significant decrease in credit facility interest expense due to a decline in both the average outstanding balance and the average interest rate. See also Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities below.   The increases in the amount of interest capitalized are due to higher development work in progress related to extended projects in West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico.   Other (Income) Expense, Net – See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2 – Basis of Presentation.   Income Tax Provision (Benefit) – The income tax provision (benefit) was as follows:                Three Months Ended  June 30,       Six Months Ended  June 30,           2009       2008       2009       2008       Income Tax Provision (Benefit) (in millions)    $ (33 )   $ (54 )   $ (218 )   $ 48      Effective Rate      37 %     27 %     47 %     40 %           See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 11 – Income Taxes for a discussion of the change in our effective tax rate during the first six months of 2009 as compared with 2008.           35      Table of Contents     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Overview Our primary cash needs are to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures related to the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, to repay outstanding borrowings and associated interest payments and other contractual commitments and to pay dividends. Traditional sources of our liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under credit facilities. Occasional sales of non-strategic crude oil and natural gas properties as well as our periodic access to capital markets may also generate cash.   The ongoing disruption in the credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions. We have reviewed the creditworthiness of the banks and financial institutions with which we maintain our investments as well as the securities underlying our investments. Thus far, our liquidity and financial position have not been materially impacted. However, further deterioration in the credit markets could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. See Executive Overview – Impact of Recession and Current Credit and Commodity Markets.   Cash and Cash Equivalents – We had $956 million in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2009. Our cash is denominated in US dollars and is invested in US Treasury securities and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. In response to the credit market crisis, we shortened the duration of our investment maturities and increased our investments in US Treasury securities.   A majority of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries and most would be subject to US income taxes if repatriated. We currently intend to use our international cash to fund international projects, including the development of West Africa and Israel.   During fourth quarter 2008, we performed an analysis of projected short-term working capital needs as well as long-term capital requirements for our US and foreign operations. As a result, we repatriated $180 million of the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries during first quarter 2009. We used the proceeds for debt repayment and general corporate purposes. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 11 – Income Taxes for a discussion of the related income tax effects.   Commodity Derivative Instruments – We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations. Such instruments include variable to fixed commodity price swaps, collars and basis swaps. Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. If actual commodity prices are higher than the fixed or ceiling prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be lower than if we had no derivative instruments. Conversely, if actual commodity prices are lower than the fixed or floor prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be higher than if we had no derivative instruments. Except for certain minor derivative contracts that are entered into from time to time by our marketing subsidiary, none of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements.   Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of June 30, 2009, the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $210 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $92 million (after consideration of netting agreements). See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for a discussion of counterparty credit risk and Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of commodity derivative instruments.   Contractual Obligations In February 2009, we completed an underwritten public offering of $1 billion of 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019. See Financing Activities below. As a result, our future debt principal payments as of June 30, 2009 consist of the following: $785 million for 2012; and $1.6 billion for 2014 and beyond for a total of $2.4 billion. Based on the total debt balance, scheduled maturities and interest rates in effect at June 30, 2009, our cash payments for interest would be $66 million for the remainder of 2009; $132 million in 2010; $132 million in 2011; $132 million in 2012; $127 million in 2013; and $1.3 billion for the remaining years for a total of $1.9 billion. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3 – Debt.           36      Table of Contents     Cash Flows Cash flow information is as follows:                 Six Months Ended  June 30,           2009       2008           (in millions)       Total Cash Provided By (Used in):                 Operating Activities    $ 498     $ 1,154      Investing Activities      (777 )     (823 )    Financing Activities      95       (8 )    Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents    $ (184 )   $ 323              Operating Activities – Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2009 decreased as compared with the first six months of 2008 due primarily to decreases in commodity prices.   Investing Activities – Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties, which may be offset by proceeds from property sales. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $46 million during the first six months of 2009 as compared with the first six months of 2008. Activity for the first six months of 2008 included capital spending of $932 million, which was partially offset by net proceeds of $109 million from asset sales. See Investing Activities – Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures below.   Financing Activities – Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first six months of 2009, we received $989 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 8¼% senior notes, and $16 million of funds were provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options. We used $821 million cash for net repayments of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and repaid $25 million of an installment note. We also paid $63 million in cash dividends on our common stock and used $1 million to repurchase shares of our common stock.   In comparison, during the first six months of 2008, $47 million of funds were provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options, and we paid $53 million in cash dividends on our common stock and used $2 million to repurchase shares of our common stock. There were no net changes in outstanding debt.   Investing Activities Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures – Information for investing activities, which consist of capital spending (including seismic expense) on an accrual basis, is as follows:                 Three Months Ended  June 30,       Six Months Ended  June 30,           2009       2008       2009       2008           (in millions)       Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures                             Unproved Property Acquisition    $ 46     $ 87     $ 62     $ 263      Exploration      50       198       145       243      Development      198       261       429       506      Corporate and Other      29       15       73       34      Total    $ 323     $ 561     $ 709     $ 1,046              Unproved property acquisition costs for the first six months of 2009 and 2008 include primarily lease bonuses on deepwater lease blocks acquired in central Gulf of Mexico lease sales.   Property Sales – In February 2008, effective July 1, 2007, we sold our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million. The gain on sale was deferred until second quarter 2009 when the Argentine government approved the sale.             37      Table of Contents      Financing Activities Long-Term Debt – Our principal source of liquidity is an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures December 9, 2012. The commitment is $2.1 billion until December 9, 2011 at which time the commitment reduces to $1.8 billion. The credit facility (i) provides for credit facility fee rates that range from 5 basis points to 15 basis points per year depending upon our credit rating, (ii) makes available short-term loans up to an aggregate amount of $300 million and (iii) provides for interest rates that are based upon the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 20 basis points to 70 basis points depending upon our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility. The credit facility is with certain commercial lending institutions and is available for general corporate purposes.    In order to provide increased liquidity and lengthen our weighted average debt maturity, on February 27, 2009 we completed an underwritten public offering of $1 billion of 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019, receiving net proceeds of $989 million. We used substantially all of the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility.   As a result, at June 30, 2009, borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaled $785 million, leaving in excess of $1.3 billion available for use. The weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility at June 30, 2009 was 0.62%.   Our outstanding fixed-rate debt, including the new 8¼% senior unsecured notes discussed above, totaled $1.6 billion at June 30, 2009. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 7.73%, with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2097.   Our ratio of debt-to-book capital was 29% at June 30, 2009 as compared with 26% at December 31, 2008. We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes both long-term debt, excluding unamortized discount, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.   Short-Term Borrowings – In May 2009, we made the final $25 million installment payment to the seller of properties we purchased in 2007. Interest on the unpaid amount was due quarterly and accrued at a LIBOR rate plus .30%. The interest rate was 1.51% at the date of payment.   Our committed credit facility has been supplemented by short-term borrowings under various uncommitted credit lines used for working capital purposes. Uncommitted credit lines may be offered by certain banks from time to time at rates negotiated at the time of borrowing. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit lines at June 30, 2009 or December 31, 2008. Depending upon future credit market conditions, these sources may or may not be available. However, we are not dependent on them to fund our day-to-day operations.   Dividends – We paid total cash dividends of 36.0 cents per share of common stock during the first six months of 2009 and 30.0 cents per share of common stock during the first six months of 2008. On July 28, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18.0 cents per common share, payable August 24, 2009 to shareholders of record on August 10, 2009. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.   Exercise of Stock Options – We received cash proceeds of $13 million from the exercise of stock options during the first six months of 2009 as compared with $24 million during the first six months of 2008.   Common Stock Repurchases – We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 17,510 shares with a value of $1 million during the first six months of 2009 and 32,518 shares with a value of $2 million during the first six months of 2008.            38      Table of Contents     ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   Commodity Price Risk Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes – We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.   At June 30, 2009, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps, collars and basis swaps related to crude oil and natural gas sales. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net receivable position with a fair value of $118 million. Based on the June 30, 2009 published commodity futures price strips for the underlying commodities, a price increase of $1.00 per Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $10 million. A price increase of $0.10 per MMBtu for natural gas would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative receivable by approximately $11 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.        Interest Rate Risk      Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other variable-rate debt and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.   At June 30, 2009, we had $2.4 billion (excluding unamortized discount) of long-term debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.6 billion was fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.73%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss.    The remainder of our long-term debt, $785 million at June 30, 2009, was variable-rate debt drawn under our credit facility. Variable-rate debt exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to increases in market interest rates. We estimate that a hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the June 30, 2009 balance of our variable-rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $2 million.   We occasionally enter into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate “locks” used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At June 30, 2009, AOCL included $2 million, net of tax, related to interest rate locks. This amount is currently being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of our 5¼% Senior Notes due April 2014. We currently have no treasury locks outstanding.   We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our short-term investments. As of June 30, 2009, approximately 50% of our cash was invested in US Treasury securities. A hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the June 30, 2009 short-term investment balance would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately $1 million.        Foreign Currency Risk      The US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as foreign deferred tax liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, are denominated in a foreign currency. An increase in exchange rates between the US dollar and the currency of the foreign tax jurisdiction in which these liabilities are located could result in the use of additional cash to settle these liabilities. Transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and are included in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.   In the UK sector of our North Sea operations, significant future capital commitments and certain operating expenses are expected to be denominated in British pounds. Therefore, our cash flows could be impacted by future changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound. We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determined that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.           39      Table of Contents     DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors included herein, if any, and included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our principal executive officer and our acting principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              40      Table of Contents     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   See Item I. Financial Statements – Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 or our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, other than the following:   Federal climate change regulation could increase our operating and capital costs.   The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (ACES), also known as the Waxman-Markey Bill, was approved by the House of Representatives on June 26, 2009. The ACES, if passed by the Senate, would establish a variant of a “cap-and-trade” plan for greenhouse gases (GHG) in order to address climate change. A “cap-and-trade” plan would require businesses that emit more greenhouse gases than permitted to acquire emission allowances from other businesses that emit greenhouse gases at levels lower than the limits specified and then surrender these allowances as a credit against such emissions. As a result of such a plan, we could be required to purchase and surrender emission allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations.   Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the ACES, any new federal restrictions on GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade-plan, that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have an adverse effect on our business or demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce.
