Risk Factors    There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, other than the following:   Our operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico could be adversely impacted by the recent drilling rig accident and resulting oil spill.   On Thursday, April 22, 2010, a deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon, that was engaged in drilling operations for another operator, sank after an apparent blowout and fire. Although attempts are being made to seal the well, hydrocarbons have been leaking and the spill area continues to grow. We recently began drilling an exploratory well at our Santiago prospect (Galapagos project) which may be threatened by the spill. If conditions continue to deteriorate, we may be forced to suspend drilling operations.   We have significant exploration and development programs ongoing in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. At this time, we cannot predict the full impact of the incident and resulting spill on our drilling schedule or operations. In addition, we cannot predict how government agencies will respond to the incident or whether changes in laws and regulations concerning operations in the Gulf of Mexico, including the ability to obtain drilling permits, will result.   Significant delays in our drilling schedule, damage to production facilities caused by the spill, or changes in regulations regarding future exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico could increase our drilling and operating costs resulting in reduced cash flows and profitability.         31      Table of Contents      Item 2.
