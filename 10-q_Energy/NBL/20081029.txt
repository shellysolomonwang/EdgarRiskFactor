Item 1A. Risk Factors.  We estimated the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments in accordance with SFAS 157, which we adopted as of January 1, 2008. In order to determine the fair value at the end of each reporting period, we compute discounted cash flows for the duration of each commodity derivative instrument using the terms of the related contract. Inputs consist of published forward commodity price curves for the underlying commodities as of the date of the estimate. We compare these prices to the price parameters contained in our hedge contracts to determine estimated future cash inflows or outflows. We then discount the cash inflows or outflows using a combination of published LIBOR rates, Eurodollar futures rates and interest swap rates. The fair values of our commodity derivative assets and liabilities include a measure of credit risk based on current published credit default swap rates. In addition, for costless collars, we estimate the option value of the contract floors and ceilings using an option pricing model which takes into account market volatility, market prices and contract parameters. We compare our estimates of fair value with those provided by our counterparties. There have been no significant differences.         30              Beginning January 1, 2008, we use mark-to-market accounting for our commodity derivative instruments and recognize all changes in fair value in earnings in the period they occur. This can have a significant impact on our results of operations due to the volatility of the underlying commodity prices. Our liquidity is impacted by current period settlements since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. If actual commodity prices are higher than the fixed or ceiling prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows provided by operating activities will be lower than if we had no derivative instruments. As of September 30, 2008, the current portion of our commodity derivative liability totaled $189 million. Except for certain minor derivative contracts that are entered into from time to time by our marketing subsidiary, none of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements. We expect that future settlements of these liabilities would be funded from cash flows from operations, and would be substantially offset by related increases in crude oil and natural gas revenues. See additional information included in Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  Certain of our commodity contracts were executed in connection with our merger with Patina Oil & Gas Corporation, prior to the global crude oil and natural gas price escalations which began in early 2005. The settlements of these contracts have reduced our cash flows. However, these contracts will expire in December 2008. Our remaining commodity contracts were executed in more favorable price environments. Although we cannot predict market prices, our remaining commodity contract positions should result in more favorable cash flows as compared to our commodity contract positions in prior periods. See Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for our current hedge positions.  Contractual Obligations – During the first nine months of 2008, we entered into drilling and equipment contracts for our domestic operations totaling $484 million and for our international operations totaling $278 million. Had these contracts been included in our contractual obligations table in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, as amended, our domestic drilling and equipment obligations would have been $181 million in 2008, $105 million in 2009, $315 million in 2010, $301 million in 2011 and $45 million in 2012 for a total of $947 million and our international drilling and equipment obligations would have been $115 million in 2008, $75 million in 2009, $90 million in 2010 and $66 million in 2011 for a total of $346 million.          31            Cash Flows Cash flow information is as follows:            Nine Months Ended           September 30,           2008       2007           (in millions)       Total cash provided by (used in):                 Operating activities    $ 1,867     $ 1,321      Investing activities      (1,721 )     (1,015 )    Financing activities      186       (8 )    Increase in cash and cash equivalents    $ 332     $ 298         Operating Activities – Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion for the first nine months of 2008, as compared with $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity prices.  Investing Activities – Net cash used in investing activities was $1.7 billion for the first nine months of 2008, as compared with $1.0 billion for the first nine months of 2007. Investing activities in 2008 consisted of $1.9 billion in capital expenditures offset by $131 million in proceeds from asset sales. Investing activities in 2007 consisted primarily of capital expenditures. See Acquisition, Capital and Other Exploration Expenditures below.  Financing Activities – Net cash provided by financing activities was $186 million for the first nine months of 2008, as compared with $8 million used in financing activities for the first nine months of 2007. During 2008 and 2007, financing cash flows were provided by the exercise of stock options and related excess tax benefits. Financing cash flows were used to pay dividends on common stock. In addition, there were net proceeds from borrowings of $223 million in 2008 and $115 million in 2007. In 2008, $2 million was used to repurchase common stock as compared with $102 million used in 2007.  Investing Activities Acquisition, Capital and Other Exploration Expenditures – Expenditure information (on an accrual basis) is as follows:            Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended           September 30,       September 30,           2008       2007       2008       2007           (in millions)       Acquisition, Capital and Other Exploration Expenditures                             Unproved property acquisition (1)    $ 36     $ 2     $ 299     $ 93      Proved property acquisition (2)      255       -       255       6      Exploration expenditures      142       97       385       250      Development expenditures      334       345       840       842      Corporate and other expenditures      19       5       53       24      Total capital expenditures    $ 786     $ 449     $ 1,832     $ 1,215             (1)   Unproved property acquisition cost for the first nine months of 2008 includes deepwater lease blocks acquired in the March 2008 Gulf of Mexico lease sale and the Mid-continent acquisition completed in July 2008.           (2)   Proved property acquisition cost for the first nine months of 2008 includes the Mid-continent acquisition.             32            Financing Activities Long-Term Debt – Our long-term debt totaled $2.1 billion (net of unamortized discount) at September 30, 2008. Maturities range from 2011 to 2097. Our ratio of debt-to-book capital was 26% at September 30, 2008 as compared with 28% at December 31, 2007. We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes both long-term debt, excluding unamortized discount, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.  Our principal source of liquidity is an unsecured revolving credit facility due December 9, 2012. The commitment is $2.1 billion until December 9, 2011 at which time the commitment reduces to $1.8 billion. The credit facility (i) provides for credit facility fee rates that range from 5 basis points to 15 basis points per year depending upon our credit rating, (ii) makes available short-term loans up to an aggregate amount of $300 million and (iii) provides for interest rates that are based upon the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 20 basis points to 70 basis points depending upon our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility. At September 30, 2008, $1.405 billion in borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility, leaving $695 million available for use. The weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility at September 30, 2008 was 4.064%. October borrowing requests have been funded.  Our bank group is comprised of 24 commercial lending institutions, each holding between 1.0% and 7.0% of the total facility. Due to recent consolidation in the banking sector resulting from heightened stress in the credit markets, the number of lenders and their effective commitment levels within our credit facility may be reallocated over time.  Short-term Borrowings – We owe $25 million in the form of an installment payment to the seller of properties we purchased in 2007. The amount is due May 11, 2009 and is included in short-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets. Interest on the unpaid amount is due quarterly and accrues at a LIBOR rate plus .30%. The interest rate was 3.1% at September 30, 2008.  Our committed credit facility has been supplemented by short-term borrowings under various uncommitted credit lines used for working capital purposes. Uncommitted credit lines may be offered by certain banks from time to time at rates negotiated at the time of borrowing. Amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit lines totaled $23 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.92% at September 30, 2008. These amounts are included in short-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets. Depending upon future credit market conditions, these sources may or may not be available. However, we are not dependent on them to fund our day-to-day operations.  Dividends – We paid cash dividends of 48 cents per share of common stock during the first nine months of 2008 and 31.5 cents per share of common stock during the first nine months of 2007. On October 21, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per common share, payable November 17, 2008 to shareholders of record on November 3, 2008. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.  Exercise of Stock Options – We received $26 million from the exercise of stock options during the first nine months of 2008 as compared to $19 million during the first nine months of 2007.  Common Stock Repurchases – During the first nine months of 2008, we received from employees 33,000 shares of common stock with a total value of $2 million for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. During the first nine months of 2007, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $102 million, pursuant to a common stock repurchase program. The repurchase program was completed in 2007.           33            ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  Commodity Price Risk Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes – We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations. However, the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.  At September 30, 2008, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps, costless collars and basis swaps related to crude oil and natural gas sales. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value of $200 million. Based on the September 30, 2008 published forward commodity price curves for the underlying commodities, a price increase of $1.00 per Bbl for crude oil would increase the fair value of our net commodity derivative liability by approximately $12 million. A price increase of $0.10 per MMBtu for natural gas would increase the fair value of our net commodity derivative liability by approximately $7 million. Based on the October 24, 2008 published forward commodity price curves for the underlying commodities, our open commodity derivative instruments had changed to a net asset position of $245 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.  Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our variable and fixed interest rate debt. At September 30, 2008, we had $2.1 billion (excluding unamortized discount) of long-term debt outstanding, of which $650 million was fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.92%. We believe that anticipated near term changes in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and would not expose us to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss.  The remainder of our long-term debt, $1.405 billion at September 30, 2008, was variable-rate debt. We also had $48 million in short-term debt at September 30, 2008. Variable rate debt exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates. We estimate that a hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to our September 30, 2008 balance of variable-rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $4 million.  We occasionally enter into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate “locks” used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At September 30, 2008, AOCL included $3 million (net of tax) related to interest rate locks. This amount is currently being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of our 5¼% Senior Notes due April 2014.  We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our short-term investments. As of September 30, 2008, substantially all of our cash was invested in highly liquid, short-term investment grade securities with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. A hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the September 30, 2008 balance would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately $2 million.   Foreign Currency Risk We have not entered into foreign currency derivatives. The US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. We do not have any significant monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency other than our foreign deferred tax liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. An increase in exchange rates between the US dollar and the currency of the foreign tax jurisdiction in which these liabilities are located could result in the use of additional cash to settle these liabilities. However, transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and we do not believe we are currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis. Such gains or losses are included in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.         34              DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:         ·   our growth strategies;             ·   our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;             ·   anticipated trends in our business;             ·   our future results of operations;             ·   effect of current volatility in the credit markets;             ·   our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;             ·   market conditions in the oil and gas industry;             ·   our ability to make and integrate acquisitions; and             ·   the impact of governmental regulation.      Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors included herein, if any, and included in our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K, as amended, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our 2007 annual report on Form 10-K, as amended, is available on our website at www.nobleenergyinc.com.  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by Charles D. Davidson, our principal executive officer, and Chris Tong, our principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective.  We are in the process of implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software system to replace our various legacy systems. During the third quarter of 2008 we implemented another phase of the system. As appropriate, we modified the design and documentation of internal control processes and procedures relating to the implementation of the newest phase. We believe that the new ERP system has strengthened and will continue to enhance our internal controls over financial reporting as additional phases are put to use; however, there are inherent risks in implementing any new system that could impact our financial reporting.   In the event that issues arise, we have manual procedures in place which would facilitate our continued recording and reporting of results from the new ERP system. However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not detect or prevent misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   We will continue to monitor, test, and appraise the impact and effect of the new ERP system on our internal controls and procedures as additional phases and features of the system are implemented. There were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting, except as described above.         35            PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  See Item I. Financial Statements – Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, as amended, other than the following:   Hedging transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk.   Our hedging transactions also expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. To mitigate counterparty credit risk we conduct our hedging activities with a diverse group of major financial institutions. We use master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. We also monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties on an ongoing basis. However, the current disruptions occurring in the financial markets could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty’s liquidity, which could impair their ability to perform under the terms of the hedging contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty’s creditworthiness or ability to perform.  In addition, during periods of falling commodity prices, such as has occurred recently, our hedge receivable positions increase, which increases our exposure. If commodity prices continue to decline and our receivable positions continue to increase, a loss from counterparty nonperformance could be significant.  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
