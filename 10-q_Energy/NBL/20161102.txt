Item 1A. Risk Factors.Development Concept Selection Costs   For our Leviathan and Cyprus discoveries, full field development may require several phases, with various facilities serving both domestic and regional export demand. In order to determine an optimum development scenario for these discoveries, we and our partners engage in development planning, also known as pre-FEED and FEED studies. Furthermore, we may progress pre-FEED and FEED studies simultaneously for multiple development options, with the realization that only one option may ultimately be approved or be economically feasible. This simultaneous progression of multiple options enables us to advance a final investment decision and quality development of resources in a timely and efficient manner.Conducting pre-FEED and FEED work to varying degrees for a range of phased development scenarios may result in our incurring significant charges, as compared with pre-FEED and FEED costs incurred for previous offshore projects where the resources were not as significant. Other factors that may increase our pre-FEED and FEED costs include location of a field in a remote and/or under-developed area, lack of availability of, or capacity at, third party production platforms or other infrastructure, technical complexity, market availability, and significant time and effort required for government approval.Once the final development plan has been determined and our board of directors has sanctioned a final investment decision, we expect to identify certain development scenarios that must be eliminated from further consideration. As a result, final investment decision for our Leviathan project may result in the write-off of pre-FEED and FEED costs, estimated at approximately $100 million, pre-tax, as of September 30, 2016. Pre-FEED and FEED costs are included in our capitalized development well cost balances. Producing Properties We did not recognize any material impairments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The cash flow model that we use to assess proved properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as management’s estimates of future crude oil and natural gas production along with operating and development costs, market outlook on forward commodity prices, and interest rates. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date of estimate. However, a decrease in forward commodity prices, or widening of basis differentials, alone could result in an impairment. In addition, well decommissioning programs, especially in deepwater or remote locations, are often complex and expensive. It may be difficult to estimate timing of actual abandonment activities, which are subject to regulatory approval and the availability of rigs and services. It may also be difficult to estimate costs of rigs and services in periods of fluctuating demand. In addition, we do not operate certain assets and we therefore work with respective operators to receive updated estimates of abandonment activities and costs. For example, the operator of the MacCulloch North Sea field has notified working interest owners that the scope and magnitude of decommissioning activities has been revised downward, resulting in a potentially accelerated project timeline with lower field abandonment costs. As of September 30, 2016, we had a total asset retirement obligation of $84 million related to this remediation project. As the operator moves beyond the initial decommissioning phase, we will continue to monitor the status and costs of the project and will adjust our estimate accordingly. See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 10. Asset Retirement Obligations.Divestments We actively manage our asset portfolio. If properties are reclassified as assets held for sale in the future, they will be valued at the lower of net book value or anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell. Impairment expense would be recorded for any excess of net book value over anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell. See Note 4.

Both types of agreements may include transportation charges. One type of agreement is a netback agreement, under which we sell crude oil and natural gas at the wellhead and receive a price, net of transportation expense incurred by the purchaser. In the case of NGLs, we may receive a price from the purchaser, which is net of fractionation and processing costs. Historically, we have recorded revenue at the net price we had received from the purchaser, net of transportation, fractionation or processing costs. Beginning in 2016, we changed our presentation of revenue to no longer include expenses netted from revenue by the purchaser. Crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales are now shown without deductions relating to transportation, fractionation or processing. These deductions are now recorded as production expense. Prior year amounts, including revenues, expenses, average realized sales prices and average production costs per BOE, have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. For NGL sales, amounts reclassified for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $18 million and $37 million, respectively. Amounts reclassified for crude oil and natural gas sales were de minimis. In addition, commodity prices we receive may be reduced by location basis differentials, which can be significant. For example, transportation bottlenecks and oversupply in the Marcellus Shale have reduced the amount of production reaching higher priced out-of-basin locations. As a result of location basis differentials, our reported sales prices may differ significantly from published commodity price benchmarks for the same period. 38Table of Contents   Average daily sales volumes and average realized sales prices were as follows: Sales Volumes Average Realized Sales Prices Crude Oil & Condensate(MBbl/d) NaturalGas(MMcf/d) NGLs(MBbl/d) Total(MBoe/d) (1) Crude Oil & Condensate(Per Bbl) NaturalGas(Per Mcf) NGLs(Per Bbl)Three Months Ended September 30, 2016United States99 874 55 299 $41.23 $2.38 $14.70Equatorial Guinea (2)22 261 — 65 43.73 0.27 —Israel— 310 — 52 — 5.22 —Total Consolidated Operations121 1,445 55 416 41.67 2.61 14.70Equity Investees (3)2 — 7 9 45.72 — 23.65Total123 1,445 62 425 $41.75 $2.61 $15.66Three Months Ended September 30, 2015United States83 741 49 255 $42.42 $2.01 $11.37Equatorial Guinea (2)27 231 — 65 45.99 0.27 —Israel — 303 — 51 — 5.39 —Total Consolidated Operations110 1,275 49 371 43.30 2.50 11.37Equity Investees (3)2 — 6 8 51.41 — 24.86Total112 1,275 55 379 $43.44 $2.50 $12.73              Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016United States99 902 56 304 $37.23 $2.00 $13.38Equatorial Guinea (2)25 230 — 64 40.74 0.27 —Israel— 284 — 48 — 5.19 —Total Consolidated Operations124 1,416 56 416 37.94 2.36 13.38Equity Investees (3)2 — 5 7 43.95 — 24.43Total126 1,416 61 423 $38.02 $2.36 $14.32Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015United States73 658 34 217 $46.02 $2.20 $13.77Equatorial Guinea (2)29 221 — 66 52.15 0.27 —Israel— 254 — 43 — 5.39 —Other International (4)1 — — 1 55.52 — —Total Consolidated Operations103 1,133 34 327 47.79 2.54 13.77Equity Investees (3)2 — 5 6 51.67 — 28.77Total105 1,133 39 333 $47.85 $2.54 $15.64(1) Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of crude oil equivalent. This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given commodity price disparities, the price for a barrel of crude oil equivalent for US natural gas and NGLs are significantly less than the price for a barrel of crude oil. In Israel, we sell natural gas under contracts where the majority of the price is fixed, resulting in less commodity price disparity between reporting periods.(2) Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant, an LNG plant and a power generation plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned in part by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.(3) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the LPG plant in Equatorial Guinea.

Equity method investments are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets, and our share of earnings is reported as income from equity method investees in our consolidated statements of operations. Within our consolidated statements of cash flows, activity is reflected within cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities. Income from equity method investees increased for the first nine months of 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase includes a $9 million increase from Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO), our methanol investee; a $3 million 40Table of Contents   decrease from Alba Plant, our LPG investee, due to lower realized prices; and an increase of $4 million from our investments in CONE Gathering LLC and CONE Midstream Partners due primarily to higher throughput volumes.Operating Costs and ExpensesOperating costs and expenses were as follows:     Increase / (Decrease)from Prior Year(millions)2016 2015 Three Months Ended September 30,     Production Expense$274 $247 11 %Exploration Expense125 203 (38)%Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization621 539 15 %General and Administrative95 109 (13)%Other Operating Expense, Net45 188 (76)%Total$1,160 $1,286 (10)%      Nine Months Ended September 30,     Production Expense$820 $715 15 %Exploration Expense376 308 22 %Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization1,859 1,444 29 %General and Administrative293 308 (5)%Other Operating Expense, Net66 310 (79)%Total$3,414 $3,085 11 %Changes in operating costs and expenses are discussed below.41Table of Contents   Production Expense Components of production expense were as follows:(millions, except unit rate)Total per BOE (1) Total UnitedStates Equatorial Guinea Israel Corporate Three Months Ended September 30, 2016           Lease Operating Expense (2)$3.42 $131 $98 $22 $8 $3Production and Ad Valorem Taxes0.78 30 30 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense  (3)2.95 113 113 — — —Total Production Expense$7.15 $274 $241 $22 $8 $3Total Production Expense per BOE  $7.15 $8.77 $3.67 $1.67 N/MThree Months Ended September 30, 2015           Lease Operating Expense (2)$3.89 $133 $92 $26 $13 $2Production and Ad Valorem Taxes0.83 28 28 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense  (3)2.51 86 86 — — —Total Production Expense$7.23 $247 $206 $26 $13 $2Total Production Expense per BOE  $7.23 $8.77 $4.32 $2.78 N/MNine Months Ended September 30, 2016           Lease Operating Expense (2)$3.62 $413 $305 $75 $25 $8Production and Ad Valorem Taxes0.64 72 72 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense  (3)2.94 335 335 — — —Total Production Expense$7.20 $820 $712 $75 $25 $8Total Production Expense per BOE  $7.20 $8.53 $4.30 $1.91 N/MNine Months Ended September 30, 2015           Lease Operating Expense (2)$4.70 $419 $274 $96 $38 $11Production and Ad Valorem Taxes1.00 89 89 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense (3)2.32 207 207 — — —Total Production Expense$8.02 $715 $570 $96 $38 $11Total Production Expense per BOE  $8.02 $9.61 $5.32 $3.27 N/MN/M amount is not meaningful. (1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.(2) Lease operating expense includes oil and gas operating costs (labor, fuel, repairs, replacements, saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs) and workover expense.(3) Certain of our revenue received from purchasers was historically presented with deduction for transportation, fractionation or processing costs. Beginning in 2016, we have changed our presentation of revenue to no longer include these expenses as deductions from revenue. These costs are now included within production expense and prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See Results of Operations – Revenues, above.For third quarter and first nine months of 2016, total production expense increased as compared with 2015 due to the following: •an increase in transportation and gathering expense due to higher production, including the addition of onshore US production from our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets acquired in third quarter 2015, and from our Big Bend and Dantzler development projects in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which began producing in fourth quarter 2015, and Gunflint in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which began producing in July 2016;partially offset by: •a decrease in production and ad valorem taxes resulting from lower revenues and an onshore US severance tax refund, both driven by a decline in US commodity prices. While total production expense has increased as a result of increased production for the respective periods compared to 2015, costs on a per BOE basis have declined. We are working to maintain lease operating expense cost reductions in areas such as equipment utilization and saltwater disposal which help to optimize cost and operational efficiencies.42Table of Contents   Exploration Expense Components of exploration expense were as follows:(millions)Total United States West  Africa (1) Eastern Mediter-ranean (2) Other Int'l, Corporate (3)Three Months Ended September 30, 2016        Leasehold Impairment and Amortization$96 $71 $— $— $25Dry Hole Expense5 — — — 5Seismic, Geological and Geophysical 15 — — — 15Staff Expense15 1 — — 14Other (4)(6) — — — (6)Total Exploration Expense$125 $72 $— $— $53Three Months Ended September 30, 2015        Leasehold Impairment and Amortization$41 $41 $— $— $—Dry Hole Expense135 — 27 — 108Seismic, Geological and Geophysical — — — — —Staff Expense27 3 — 2 22Other (4)— — — — —Total Exploration Expense$203 $44 $27 $2 $130          Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016        Leasehold Impairment and Amortization$127 $102 $— $— $25Dry Hole Expense105 79 — 26 —Seismic, Geological and Geophysical 47 — 10 — 37Staff Expense53 2 2 — 49Other (4)44 35 — 7 2Total Exploration Expense$376 $218 $12 $33 $113Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015        Leasehold Impairment and Amortization$78 $73 $— $5 $—Dry Hole Expense154 18 27 — 109Seismic, Geological and Geophysical 2 2 — — —Staff Expense72 2 2 4 64Other (4)2 — — 2 —Total Exploration Expense$308 $95 $29 $11 $173(1) West Africa includes Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Sierra Leone (which we exited in second quarter 2015), and Gabon.(2) Eastern Mediterranean includes Israel and Cyprus.(3) Other International, Corporate includes the Falkland Islands, other new ventures and corporate expenditures.(4) Includes lease rentals and other exploratory costs. Exploration expense for third quarter and first nine months of 2016 included:•leasehold impairment expense primarily related to write-off of leases and licenses in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico of $56 million and Falkland Islands of $25 million;•dry hole cost primarily related to the Silvergate exploratory well, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and the Dolphin 1 natural gas discovery, offshore Israel; •seismic expense related to the acquisition of 3D seismic data in West Africa and other international areas; •other cost for onshore US includes lease rentals primarily related to Permian Basin leases; and•salaries and related expenses for corporate exploration and new ventures personnel.Exploration expense for third quarter and first nine months of 2015 included the following:•dry hole cost related to onshore US, offshore Cameroon (Cheetah), and Falkland Islands (Humpback) exploration wells;•leasehold impairment, including a $41 million deepwater Gulf of Mexico lease; and•salaries and related expenses for corporate exploration and new ventures personnel. 43Table of Contents   Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD&A expense was as follows: Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015DD&A Expense (millions) (1)$621 $539 $1,859 $1,444Unit Rate per BOE (2)$16.23 $15.75 $16.31 $16.21(1) For DD&A expense by geographical area, see Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 13. Segment Information.(2) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.Total DD&A expense for third quarter and first nine months of 2016 increased as compared with 2015 due to the following:•the addition of Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin production in third quarter 2015, resulting in $144 million and $31 million in DD&A expense, respectively, during the first nine months of 2016;•an increase in sales volumes due to commencement of production from the Big Bend, Dantzler and Gunflint development projects in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, additional wells which came online in the Marcellus Shale and increased demand in Eastern Mediterranean; and•a reduction in proved reserves in fourth quarter 2015 primarily due to downward price revisions in DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale; partially offset by:•an overall lower segment rate for offshore Equatorial Guinea due to the swing in production between higher DD&A rate assets Aseng and Alen and lower DD&A rate asset Alba; and •the impact of lower net book value as a result of a fourth quarter 2015 impairment for offshore Equatorial Guinea properties.The increase in the unit rate per BOE for third quarter and first nine months of 2016 as compared with 2015 was due primarily to increased higher-cost production volumes from certain onshore US properties and recently commenced deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets, Big Bend, Dantzler and Gunflint. The increase in the unit rate per BOE was partially offset by an increase in lower-cost production volumes from the Tamar and Alba fields and reductions in net book values in fourth quarter 2015 mainly due to downward price revisions.Significant changes to the proved reserves at December 31, 2015 include additions of 269 MMBoe resulting from the Rosetta Merger during the third quarter 2015, offset by downward revisions of 307 MMBoe that were commodity price driven. Estimates of proved reserves significantly affect our DD&A expense. Holding other factors constant, a decline in proved reserves estimates caused by decreases in the 12-month average commodity prices, will result in accelerating DD&A expense in future periods. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows: Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015G&A Expense (millions)$95 $109 $293 $308Unit Rate per BOE (1)$2.48 $3.19 $2.57 $3.46(1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.G&A expense for third quarter and first nine months of 2016 decreased as compared with 2015 primarily due to cost savings initiatives, including reduced use of contractors and consultants, decreased special projects and other discretionary expenses, and decreases in employee personnel costs, partially offset by the addition of Rosetta employees in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in the unit rate per BOE for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 as compared with 2015 was due primarily to the increase in production volumes in onshore US, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and Eastern Mediterranean, and cost synergies achieved through the Rosetta Merger. 44Table of Contents   Other Operating (Income) Expense Other operating (income) expense was as follows: Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,(millions)2016 2015 2016 2015(Gain) Loss on Asset Due to Terminated Contract$(3) $— $44 $—Marketing and Processing Expense, Net20 10 58 25Loss on Divestitures— — 23 —Corporate Restructuring Expense— 21 — 39Purchase Price Allocation Adjustment— — (25) —Gain on Extinguishment of Debt — — (80) —Asset Impairments — — — 43Inventory Adjustment14 — 14 —Building Exit Cost4 18 8 18Rosetta Merger Expenses— 71 — 73Pension Plan Expense— 67 — 88Stacked Drilling Rig Expense3 13 8 20Other, Net 7 (12) 16 4Total$45 $188 $66 $310See Item 1.

Cash settlement gains for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016  were driven by crude oil and natural gas hedge contracts primarily executed in previous years when commodities were trading at higher prices. Our crude oil contracts contributed $95 million and $317 million of cash settlements and our natural gas contracts contributed $8 million and $34 million, respectively, of cash settlements received in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016. In addition, we acquired commodity derivative contracts as part of the Rosetta Merger. Acquired crude oil contracts contributed gains of $24 million and $78 million of cash settlements and acquired natural gas contracts contributed $5 million and $25 million, respectively, of cash settlements received in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016.Non-cash decreases in the fair value of our crude oil and natural gas commodity derivative contracts of $77 million and $507 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, were primarily driven by the evolving and diverse mix of derivative contracts (i.e. the type of derivative instrument, the commodity being hedged and related volumes), acquired commodity derivative contracts as part of the Rosetta Merger, and fluctuations of current period and future commodity prices. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Note 8. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.45Table of Contents   Interest Expense and Capitalized Interest Interest expense and capitalized interest were as follows: Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,(millions, except unit rate)2016 2015 2016 2015Interest Expense, Gross$103 $110 $312 $294Capitalized Interest(17) (39) (70) (111)Interest Expense, Net$86 $71 $242 $183Unit Rate per BOE (1)$2.25 $2.08 $2.12 $2.05(1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.Interest expense, gross, was flat for third quarter 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase in interest expense, gross, for the first nine months of 2016 as compared with 2015 is primarily due to the impact of senior notes assumed by us in the Rosetta Merger during third quarter 2015, a portion of which were subsequently tendered during first quarter 2016 through proceeds derived from our Term Loan Facility. See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 7. Debt.The decrease in capitalized interest for third quarter and first nine months of 2016 as compared with 2015 is primarily due to lower work in progress amounts related to major long-term projects including Big Bend and Dantzler, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which were both completed in fourth quarter 2015 and Gunflint, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and the Alba B3 compression project, offshore Equatorial Guinea, which were both completed in July 2016. Additional items that contributed to the decrease in capitalized interest include offshore Cyprus (due to the farm-out agreement with a partner for a 35% interest in Block 12 during fourth quarter 2015), offshore Falkland Islands (due to the Humpback prospect that began drilling operations in June 2015 and was determined to be a dry hole during fourth quarter 2015), and timing of onshore US activities.

Income Taxes for a discussion of the change in our effective tax rate for third quarter and first nine months of 2016 as compared with 2015.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCapital Structure/Financing StrategyIn seeking to effectively fund and monetize our discovered hydrocarbons, we employ a capital structure and financing strategy designed to provide sufficient liquidity throughout the volatile commodity price cycle, including the current commodity price environment. Specifically, we strive to retain the ability to fund long cycle, multi-year, capital intensive development projects throughout a range of scenarios, while also funding a continuing exploration program and maintaining capacity to capitalize on financially attractive periodic mergers and acquisitions activity. We endeavor to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade debt rating in service of these objectives. We utilize a commodity price hedging program to reduce the impacts of commodity price volatility and enhance the predictability of cash flows along with a risk and insurance program to protect against disruption to our cash flows and the funding of our business.We strive to maintain a minimum liquidity level to address volatility and risk. Traditional sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, and proceeds from sales of non-core properties. We occasionally access the capital markets and, in third quarter 2016, we monetized certain of our midstream assets through the initial public offering of Noble Midstream common units. Initial Public Offering of Noble Midstream Partners LPOn September 20, 2016, Noble Midstream completed its public offering of 14,375,000 common units representing limited partner interests in Noble Midstream, which included 1,875,000 common units issued pursuant to the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional common units, at a price to the public of $22.50 per common unit ($21.21 per common unit, net of underwriting discounts). In connection with the offering, Noble Midstream generated net proceeds of $299 million from the issuance of common units and distributed $297 million to us.We own a 54.8% limited partner interest and a non-economic general partner interest in Noble Midstream, while the public owns a 45.2% limited partner interest. We consolidate Noble Midstream as a variable interest entity for financial reporting purposes; however, Noble Midstream's sources of liquidity are independent of Noble Energy. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation. The public's ownership interest in Noble Midstream is reflected as a noncontrolling interest in our financial statements as of September 30, 2016. 46Table of Contents   Noble Midstream's partnership agreement provides for a minimum quarterly distribution to the holders of common units and subordinated units of $0.3750 per unit for each whole quarter, or $1.5000 per unit on an annualized basis, to the extent Noble Midstream has sufficient available cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of certain costs and expenses. We own all of Noble Midstream's subordinated units and incentive distribution rights. Upon completion of certain events as outlined in Noble Midstream's partnership agreement, we will be entitled to receive additional distributions associated with these units.Available Liquidity Information regarding cash and debt balances as shown in the table below, does not include amounts held by Noble Midstream, which are not readily available to Noble Energy: September 30, December 31,(millions, except percentages)2016 2015Cash and Cash Equivalents$1,772 $1,001Amount Available to be Borrowed Under Revolving Credit Facility (1)4,000 4,000Total Liquidity$5,772 $5,001Total Debt (2)$7,957 $7,976Noble Energy Share of Equity9,545 10,370Ratio of Debt-to-Book Capital (3)45% 43%(1) Does not include $350 million available to be borrowed under Noble Midstream's Revolving Credit Facility, which is not available to Noble Energy. See Revolving Credit Facilities, below.(2) Total debt includes capital lease obligations and excludes unamortized debt discount/premium.(3) We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes long-term debt excluding unamortized discount, the current portion of long-term debt, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus Noble Energy's share of equity.Cash and Cash Equivalents We had approximately $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016, primarily denominated in US dollars and invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. Approximately $488 million of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries. We have recorded a related deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings of $368 million for the future additional US tax liability for the US and foreign tax rate differences, net of estimated foreign tax credit. Our cash on hand at September 30, 2016 also included $47 million relating to Noble Midstream.Revolving Credit Facilities Noble Energy's Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 27, 2020. The commitment is $4.0 billion through the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. Noble Midstream's Revolving Credit Facility matures on September 20, 2021. The commitment is $350 million through the maturity date of Noble Midstream's Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under either of these facilities. Borrowings under these facilities subject us to interest rate risk. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 7. Debt and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Term Loan We occasionally access the capital markets to ensure adequate liquidity exists in the form of unutilized capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility or to refinance scheduled debt maturities. On January 6, 2016, we entered into the Term Loan Facility which provides for a three-year term loan facility for a principal amount of $1.4 billion. In connection with the Term Loan Facility, we launched cash tender offers for certain senior notes assumed in the Rosetta Merger. The borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used solely to fund the tender offers. Collectively, the result of these transactions provides for significant future interest expense savings with a shorter term debt maturity. While we have no near-term debt maturities, we may seek to access the capital markets to refinance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016, we had $7.5 billion of long-term debt outstanding, $2.4 billion of which is due first quarter 2019. On November 1, 2016, we prepaid $850 million of long-term debt outstanding under our Term Loan Facility from cash on hand. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 7. Debt.Commodity Derivative Instruments  We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs. Such instruments may include variable to fixed price commodity swaps, two-way collars, three-way collars, swaptions and enhanced swaps. Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. We net settle by counterparty based on netting provisions within the master agreements. None of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements. Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $120 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $35 million (after consideration of netting provisions within our master agreements). 47Table of Contents   While we use commodity derivative instruments to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk, thereby mitigating our exposure to price declines, these instruments may also limit our potential cash flows in periods of rising commodity prices or even place us in a liability position respective to our counterparties. For example, should commodity prices increase, certain of our swaptions are likely to be extended by our counterparties which could require us to pay monthly cash settlements if market prices exceed the contracted swap prices.See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 8. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of commodity derivative instruments, and Credit Risk, below.Asset DivestituresIn addition, we evaluate potential strategic farm-out arrangements of our working interests for reimbursement of our capital spending and may consider non-core asset sales or other sources of funding. Furthermore, as required by the Framework, we are required to divest certain of our interests within a stipulated period of time. During the first nine months of 2016, we received cash proceeds of approximately $786 million primarily from our divestment of certain onshore US assets in the DJ Basin, our Cyprus farm-out and the sale of our Karish and Tanin discoveries, offshore Israel. On July 4, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement to divest a 3% interest in the Tamar field, offshore Israel, for $369 million, subject to customary closing adjustments. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4. Divestitures.Capital ProgramOur 50% reduction in capital spending in 2016 as compared to 2015, coupled with operating efficiencies to increase production at lower costs, has allowed us to closely align capital spending with our operating cash flows. We will continue our effort to invest capital at a level supported by current operating cash flows. Our financial capacity and lack of near-term debt maturities, coupled with our diversified global portfolio, provides us with flexibility in our investment decisions including execution of major development projects and exploration activity. Our investment program is primarily supported by production from our core onshore US development programs, combined with new production from our completed major offshore projects in the Gulf of Mexico (including the Big Bend and Dantzler development projects, which began producing in fourth quarter 2015, and from the Gunflint development, which began producing in July 2016), as well as completion of the Alba B3 compression project offshore Equatorial Guinea, which commenced production in July 2016. Presuming no significant further deterioration of commodity prices, cash flows from these assets will be available to meet a portion of our remaining 2016 capital commitments and will help to fund investments in subsequent years. See Results of Operations, above. We are currently exploring potential financing scenarios, including use of external project financing arrangements as well as using local internal cash flows supplemented by asset divestiture proceeds, to develop our significant natural gas discoveries offshore Eastern Mediterranean. Each of our development options, including the development of Leviathan infrastructure to supply domestic and regional demands, would require a multi-billion dollar investment and require a number of years to complete. See Update on Israel Natural Gas Regulatory Framework, above.Credit Risk We monitor the creditworthiness of our trade creditors, joint venture partners, hedge counterparties, and financial institutions on an ongoing basis. Counterparty credit downgrades or liquidity problems could result in a delay in our receiving proceeds from commodity sales, reimbursement of joint venture costs, and potential delays in our major development projects. As operator of the joint ventures, we pay joint venture expenses and make cash calls on our non-operating partners for their respective shares of joint venture costs. Our projects are capital cost intensive and, in some cases, a non-operating partner may experience a delay in obtaining financing for its share of the joint venture costs or have liquidity problems resulting in slow payment of joint venture costs. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of a joint venture partner, we may be required to complete their share of remediation activities or fulfill their lease obligations which could result in significant financial losses.We are unable to predict sudden changes in a party's creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict such sudden changes, our ability to negate these risks may be limited and we could incur significant financial losses.Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the form of parental guarantees, letters of credit or credit insurance; however, not all of our counterparty credit is protected through guarantees or credit support. In addition, we maintain credit insurance associated with specific purchasers. However, nonperformance by a trade creditor, joint venture partner, hedge counterparty or financial institution could result in significant financial losses.Contractual Obligations Marcellus Shale Joint Development Agreement  The joint development agreement for our jointly owned Marcellus Shale acreage provides for a multi-year drilling and development plan (default plan). We and CONSOL have agreed to an annual plan that provides for fewer wells to be drilled than the number of wells that was provided for in the default plan, and, for 2016, the amount of capital investment allocated to the Marcellus Shale core area will be less than the amount provided for in the default 48Table of Contents   plan. Each of us has a non-consent right, which is the right to elect not to participate in all (but not less than all) of the operations provided for the following year. If one of us elects to exercise the non-consent right, then the other partner, in its sole discretion, may determine the number of wells, if any, it will drill in such year, which may be significantly less than the number of wells that was provided for in the default plan, or none at all. In the event we elect to exercise our non-consent right for a given year, we would still have to pay the carried costs that are contemplated by the development plan for that non-consent year. Under the joint development agreement, this non-consent right may be exercised by each partner twice (in non-consecutive years) prior to the termination of the default plan at the end of 2020. Neither of us has exercised the non-consent right, and thus, each of us may still elect to exercise the non-consent right twice (in non-consecutive years) prior to the end of 2020. On October 29, 2016, we entered into an agreement with CONSOL to separate ownership of our jointly owned Marcellus Shale acreage, satisfy and extinguish the remaining balance of our carried cost obligation and terminate the joint development agreement. See Part II. Other Information, Item 5. Other Information.CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies and Part II. Other Information, Item 5. Other InformationExploration Commitments The terms of some of our production sharing contracts, licenses or concession agreements may require us to conduct certain exploration activities, including drilling one or more exploratory wells or acquiring seismic data, within specific time periods. These obligations can extend over periods of several years, and failure to conduct such exploration activities within the prescribed periods could lead to loss of leases or exploration rights. Continuous Development Obligations Although the majority of our assets are held by production, certain of our onshore US assets are held through continuous development obligations. Therefore, we are contractually obligated to fund a level of development activity in these areas and failure to meet these obligations may result in the loss of a lease. Our 2016 capital program allows for managing these obligations.Delivery and Firm Transportation Agreements We have entered into various long-term gathering, processing, transportation and delivery contracts for some of our onshore US crude oil and natural gas production. These contracts may commit us to deliver minimum volumes and require us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting the minimum volumes under the commitments. We may use long-term contracts such as these, which may range in term from one to 40 years, to provide flow assurance for production and to enable our production to reach markets with best pricing.Although we strive to schedule well completion activities to meet the minimum volumes under the commitments, we may experience temporary, and possibly prolonged, delivery or transportation shortfalls. During the first nine months of 2016, we incurred expense of approximately $39 million related to deficiencies and/or unutilized commitments. We expect to continue to incur deficiency and/or unutilized costs in the near-term as development activities continue. For full year 2016, we estimate these costs could range from approximately $50 million to $60 million. Should commodity prices continue to remain low or decline further, or we are unable to continue to develop our properties as planned, or certain wells become uneconomic and are shut-in, we could incur additional shortfalls in delivering or transporting the minimum volumes under these commitments. In the event that these commitments are not otherwise offset, we could be required to make future payments for any shortfalls. While we continually seek to optimize under-utilized assets through capacity release and third-party arrangements, as well as, for example, through the shifting of transportation of production from rail cars to pipelines when we receive a higher netback price, we may continue to experience these shortfalls both in the near and long-term. Credit Rating Events   We do not have any triggering events on our consolidated debt that would cause a default in case of a downgrade of our credit rating. In addition, there are no existing ratings triggers in any of our commodity hedging agreements that would require the posting of collateral. However, a series of downgrades or other negative rating actions could increase our cost of financing, and may increase our requirements to post collateral as financial assurance of performance under certain other contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts, crude oil and natural gas sales contracts, work commitments and certain abandonment obligations. A requirement to post collateral could have a negative impact on our liquidity.49Table of Contents   Cash FlowsCash flow information is as follows: Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, (millions)2016 2015Total Cash Provided By (Used in)   Operating Activities$1,054 $1,486Investing Activities(386) (2,393)Financing Activities123 752Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents$791 $(155)Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2016 decreased as compared with 2015. Decreases in average realized commodity prices and lower settlements of commodity derivative instruments were partially offset by increases in sales volumes. Working capital changes resulted in a $171 million operating cash flow reduction in the first nine months of 2016 as compared with a negative impact of $74 million in the first nine months of 2015.Investing Activities Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method. These investing activities may be offset by proceeds from property sales or dispositions, including farm-out arrangements, which may result in reimbursement for capital spending that occurred in prior periods. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment decreased by $1.4 billion during the first nine months of 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to a reduced capital spending program. Investing activities included $8 million in CONE Gathering LLC during the first nine months of 2016 as compared with $86 million in the same period of 2015. We received $786 million in proceeds from asset divestitures during the first nine months of 2016, as compared with $151 million during the same period in 2015. Financing Activities  Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of Noble Energy common stock and Noble Midstream common units, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first nine months of 2016, we received proceeds ($299 million) from our initial public offering of Noble Midstream common units and funds from the term loan acquisition ($1.4 billion). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($129 million), fund the purchase of certain of our outstanding senior notes ($1.38 billion), and make principal payments related to capital lease obligations ($39 million).In comparison, during the first nine months of 2015, funds were provided by cash proceeds from the issuance of Noble Energy common stock to the public ($1.1 billion). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($214 million), repay outstanding borrowings under the Rosetta revolving credit facility and terminate the facility ($74 million) and make principal payments related to capital lease obligations ($49 million).See Item 1.

(3) Investment in equity method investee represents primarily contributions to CONE Gathering LLC which owns and operates the natural gas gathering infrastructure associated with our Marcellus Shale joint venture.Total expenditures decreased during the first nine months of 2016 as compared with 2015 due to our reduced capital spending program. See Operating Outlook – 2016 Capital Investment Program, above. Financing ActivitiesLong-Term Debt Our principal source of liquidity is our Revolving Credit Facility that matures August 27, 2020. At September 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $4.0 billion available for use. We may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility to help fund our capital investment program, and may periodically borrow amounts for working capital purposes. On January 6, 2016, we entered into the Term Loan Facility with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., as syndication agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto, which provides for a three-year term loan facility for a principal amount of $1.4 billion. In connection with the Term Loan Facility, we launched cash tender offers for certain Senior Notes assumed in the Rosetta Merger. The borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used solely to fund the tender offers. On November 1, 2016, we prepaid $850 million of long-term debt outstanding under our Term Loan Facility from cash on hand. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 7. Debt.Our outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding capital lease obligations) totaled approximately $6.1 billion at September 30, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 5.69%, with maturities ranging from March 2019 to August 2097.Dividends We paid total cash dividends of 30 cents per share of common stock during the first nine months of 2016 as compared with 54 cents per share during the first nine months of 2015.On October 25, 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 10 cents per common share, which will be paid on November 21, 2016 to shareholders of record on November 7, 2016. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.Exercise of Stock Options We received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $8 million during the first nine months of 2016 and $7 million during the first nine months of 2015.Common Stock Repurchases We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 235,157 shares with a value of $8 million during the first nine months of 2016 and 481,229 shares with a value of $20 million during the first nine months of 2015. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskCommodity Price RiskDerivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.At September 30, 2016, we had various open commodity derivative instruments related to crude oil and natural gas. Changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of $85 million. Based on the September 30, 2016 published commodity futures price curves for the underlying commodities, a hypothetical price increase of 10% per Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by approximately $70 million. A hypothetical price increase of 10% per MMBtu for natural gas would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by approximately $33 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.Interest Rate RiskChanges in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, Noble Midstream Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.At September 30, 2016, we had approximately $7.5 billion (excluding capital lease obligations) of long-term debt, net, outstanding. Of this amount, $6.1 billion was fixed-rate debt, net, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.69%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to interest rate risk or cash flow loss.However, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances. As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled nearly $1.8 billion, approximately 65% of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. In addition, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to variable interest rates which expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to potential increases in market interest rates. A change in the interest rate applicable to our variable-rate debt could expose us to additional interest cost. While we currently have no interest rate derivative instruments as of September 30, 2016, we may invest in such instruments in the future in order to mitigate interest rate risk. A change in the interest rate applicable to our short-term investments would have a de minimis impact. Foreign Currency RiskThe US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as taxes payable in foreign tax jurisdictions, are settled in the foreign local currency. A reduction in the value of the US dollar against currencies of other countries in which we have material operations could result in the use of additional cash to settle operating, administrative, and tax liabilities. Net transaction gains and losses were de minimis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determine that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:•our growth strategies;•our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;•anticipated trends in our business;•our future results of operations;•our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;•market conditions in the oil and gas industry;•our ability to make and integrate acquisitions;•the impact of governmental fiscal terms and/or regulation, such as those involving the protection of the environment or marketing of production, as well as other regulations; and•access to resources.Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently.
