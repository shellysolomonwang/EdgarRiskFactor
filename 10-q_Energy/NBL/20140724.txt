Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our operations may be adversely affected by violent acts such as from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts that may occur in regions that encompass our operations.Update on Hydraulic FracturingPotential Rulemaking Although hydraulic fracturing is regulated primarily at the state level, governments and agencies at all levels from federal to municipal are conducting studies and considering regulations, and some have proposed rules. A measure to ban hydraulic fracturing was on the ballot in the City of Loveland in northern Colorado in June of 2014. Industry worked with the community to defeat that initiative. Also during 2014, we have been actively campaigning against statewide ballot initiatives that would unreasonably restrict or limit crude oil and natural gas development in Colorado. There are currently two remaining initiatives that have survived titling and Supreme Court review and are in a position to collect sufficient signatures to be placed on the November 2014 ballot. These are:•an initiative to amend the state constitution to establish an environmental bill of rights; and•an initiative to amend the state constitution to impose a 2000-foot statewide drilling setback from occupied structures, unless a waiver is obtained from the landowner.Petitioners have until August 4, 2014 to gather 86,105 verified signatures and we will work with the State of Colorado to ensure any signatures submitted on these initiatives are properly verified. The ultimate passage and implementation of one or both of these initiatives could have a negative impact on our business. In particular, a statewide drilling setback will likely delay or otherwise limit our drilling and development activities in certain parts of the DJ Basin. This could result in a reduction in our proved reserves and negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and stock price.In Nevada, state regulators are in the process of promulgating rules to govern hydraulic fracturing and new crude oil and natural gas development. We have actively participated in that process and do not believe it will have a material impact on our activities. We will continue to monitor new and proposed legislation and regulations to assess the potential impact on our operations.Concurrently, we are engaged in extensive public education and outreach efforts with the goal of engaging and educating the general public about the energy, economic and environmental benefits of safe and responsible crude oil and natural gas development.26Table of Contents   RegulationsOn February 23, 2014, the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (Commission) adopted a number of revisions to its oil and gas industry regulations. The revisions include the full adoption of US Environmental Protection Agency's Standards of Performance for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production, Transmission, and Distribution (also known as NSPS Quad O) with corresponding complementary control measures. The control measures set forth requirements for identifying and repairing leaks, undertaking record keeping, and submitting reports. The revisions also include the first ever regulation of methane emissions from the industry. In collaboration with the Environmental Defense Fund and other oil and gas operators, we provided testimony and evidence to the Commission in support of the adopted revisions. The adopted revised regulations were published in the Colorado Register on March 25, 2014, Volume 37, No. 6, and are effective as of April 14, 2014. Copies of these regulations are available at http://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR. We do not currently believe costs incurred to implement these regulations will be material to our earnings or cash flows.Sales VolumesThe execution of our strategy has delivered a diversified production growth most recently due to our Tamar natural gas field and Alen condensate project coming online in 2013 along with accelerated activity in onshore US unconventional developments. On a BOE basis, total sales volumes were 11% higher for the second quarter of 2014 as compared with the second quarter of 2013, and our mix of sales volumes was 46% global liquids, 27% international natural gas, and 27% US natural gas. See Results of Operations – Revenues, below.Commodity Price ChangesAverage realized natural gas prices increased 5% in the US and 13% in Israel for second quarter of 2014 as compared with the second quarter of 2013. Average realized crude oil prices increased 5% in the US and 7% in Equatorial Guinea for the second quarter of 2014 as compared with the second quarter of 2013.Recently Issued Accounting StandardsSee Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2. Basis of Presentation.OPERATING OUTLOOK2014 Production Our expected crude oil, natural gas and NGL production for 2014 may be impacted by several factors including:•changes to drilling plans in the DJ Basin and the Marcellus Shale;•Israeli demand for electricity, which affects demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation and industrial market growth, and which is impacted by unseasonable weather;•potential downtime at key assets including: Galapagos and Swordfish, deepwater Gulf of Mexico; Tamar, offshore Israel; and Aseng and Alen, offshore Equatorial Guinea;•natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Alba and Aseng fields offshore Equatorial Guinea; and•potential weather-related volume curtailments due to hurricanes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico which can shut-in or reduce production.2014 Capital Investment Program Total capital expenditures are estimated at $4.8 to $5.0 billion for 2014. We expect to invest approximately 70% of the program in onshore US development and approximately 30% of the program in global deepwater activities. The 2014 capital investment program is estimated to exceed operating cash flows and is expected to be funded from cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) and/or other financing. Funding may also be provided by proceeds from divestment of non-core assets or farm-out of working interests in exploration prospects. See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities.We will continue to evaluate the level of capital spending and remain flexible throughout the year. For further discussion, see Executive Overview – Update on Hydraulic Fracturing, above, regarding potential legislative or regulatory changes in the use of hydraulic fracturing, and Liquidity and Capital Resources – Contractual Obligations, below, regarding the CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation.Potential for Future Asset Impairment, Dry Hole or Lease Abandonment ExpenseExploration Activities We have an active exploratory drilling program. In the event we conclude that an exploratory well did not encounter hydrocarbons or that a discovery is not economically or operationally viable, the associated capitalized exploratory well costs would be charged to expense. For example, in the Falkland Islands we are processing recently acquired seismic data. We will conduct seismic interpretation and basin modeling during the remainder of 2014 in order to determine our future drilling program. Integration of seismic information with the results of the Scotia exploratory well will allow us to assess the economic viability of this prospect. If we were to determine, based on the results of seismic interpretation and/or 27Table of Contents   additional drilling activities, that the Scotia prospect is not economically viable, the costs we have incurred (approximately $73 million to date) would be written off to dry hole expense.Additionally, we may not conduct exploration activities prior to lease expirations. For example, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, while we continue to mature our prospect portfolio, regulations have become more stringent due to the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010. In some instances, specifically engineered blowout preventers, rigs, and completion equipment may be required for high pressure environments. Regulatory requirements or lack of readily available equipment could prevent us from engaging in future exploration activities during our current lease terms.One particular deepwater Gulf of Mexico lease, which we acquired under regulations in effect prior to the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Moratorium, is set to expire on July 31, 2014. We have been working to mature this prospect by conducting various activities, including the licensing and processing of 3-D seismic data and interpretation of geophysical information, which have resulted in the identification of a potential hydrocarbon-bearing formation below 25,000 feet. We reviewed the criteria for a lease suspension of operations (SOO), which may be granted by regulatory authorities, and believe we satisfy each of the required conditions. We submitted an application for the SOO, evidencing satisfaction of the required conditions, on July 7, 2014. If an SOO is granted, we intend to continue processing of subsalt imaging and developing an exploration plan, targeting a 2017 exploratory well spud date. Although we believe we have satisfied the required conditions for the SOO, there is no certainty an extension will be obtained prior to the lease expiration. The lease had a net book value of approximately $41 million at June 30, 2014. If we are unable to obtain an extension, we must relinquish the lease, abandon our exploration plans, and write off the book value to exploration expense.Producing Properties Commodity prices remain volatile. A decline in future crude oil or natural gas prices could result in impairment charges. The cash flow model that we use to assess proved properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as management’s estimates of future oil and gas production along with operating and development costs, market outlook on forward commodity prices, and interest rates. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date of estimate. However, a decrease in forward crude oil or natural gas prices alone could result in an impairment.Occasionally, well mechanical problems arise, which can reduce production and potentially result in reductions in proved reserves estimates. For example, our South Raton development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in due to mechanical issues. We have conducted remediation work; however, return to production has been delayed due to work being performed at the non-operated host facility. We expect to begin producing later in third quarter 2014. No impairment is currently indicated; however, we will monitor production and reserves when South Raton is brought back online and continue to assess the field for possible impairment. South Raton had a net book value of approximately $123 million at June 30, 2014.In addition, well decommissioning programs, especially in deepwater or remote locations, are often complex and expensive. It may be difficult to estimate timing of actual abandonment activities, which are subject to regulatory approval and the availability of rigs and services. It may be difficult to estimate costs as rigs and services become more expensive in periods of higher demand. Therefore, our ARO estimates may change, sometimes significantly, and could result in asset impairment. Divestments We are currently marketing certain non-core onshore US properties, including our assets in the Piceance Basin of western Colorado. If properties are reclassified as assets held for sale in the future, they will be valued at the lower of net book value or anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell. Impairment expense would be recorded for any excess of net book value over anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell. In addition, we would allocate a portion of goodwill to any non-core onshore US property held for sale that constitutes a business, which could potentially decrease any gain or increase any loss recorded on the sale. In addition, certain assets offshore Israel were classified as held for sale at June 30, 2014. No impairments are indicated at this time. However, failure to achieve acceptable sale terms or delays in closing sales of these properties could result in impairment and/or loss on sale.Potential Change in Pennsylvania Tax Structure The State of Pennsylvania has been addressing a potential budget deficit. As a result, Pennsylvania lawmakers have been considering various alternatives for generating additional revenues, including additional taxes on crude oil and natural gas production. Additional taxes could be in the form of a severance tax, which would be assessed on the value of the natural gas produced. A severance tax, if imposed, may or may not replace the current local impact fee, which is assessed on a per well basis at a rate determined primarily by the age of the well, under a law signed in 2012.We are currently unable to predict whether a severance tax will be imposed by the State of Pennsylvania. However, additional taxes on our crude oil, condensate or natural gas production could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.28Table of Contents   RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn the discussion below, the North Sea geographical segment is reflected as discontinued operations for the first six months of 2013.

This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given commodity price disparities, the price for a barrel of crude oil equivalent for natural gas is significantly less than the price for a barrel of crude oil. The price for a barrel of NGL is also less than the price for a barrel of crude oil.30Table of Contents   (2) Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant, an LNG plant and a power generation plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.(3) Other International includes primarily China.(4) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea.

Additional NGL production from the Marcellus Shale added 2 MBbl/d during second quarter and first six months of 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to increased production from the wet gas acreage. NGL sales in the DJ Basin increased by 5 MBbl/d during the second quarter of 2014 as compared with 2013, and recent sales of our non-core onshore US properties have slightly reduced sales volumes as compared with second quarter 2013. Additionally, sales prices have increased 13% for the first six months of 2014, compared to the first six months of 2013.Income from Equity Method Investees  We have a 45% interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC, which owns and operates a methanol plant and related facilities, and a 28% interest in Alba Plant LLC, which owns and operates a liquefied petroleum gas processing plant.

and•increased transportation and gathering expense in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale due to higher production volumes from ongoing development activities;partially offset by:•decreased lease operating expense from sales of non-core onshore US properties in 2013; and•decreased lease operating expense from natural field decline from the Mari-B field, offshore Israel.33Table of Contents   Exploration Expense Components of exploration expense were as follows:(millions)Total United States West  Africa (1) Eastern Mediter-ranean (2) Other Int'l, Corporate (3)Three Months Ended June 30, 2014        Dry Hole Cost$— $— $— $— $—Seismic9 8 — 1 —Staff Expense33 10 2 3 18Other17 17 — — —Total Exploration Expense$59 $35 $2 $4 $18Three Months Ended June 30, 2013        Dry Hole Cost$23 $15 $8 $— $—Seismic25 7 2 6 10Staff Expense30 5 3 — 22Other12 12 — — —Total Exploration Expense$90 $39 $13 $6 $32          Six Months Ended June 30, 2014        Dry Hole Cost$2 $2 $— $— $—Seismic32 15 — 2 15Staff Expense68 18 4 5 41Other31 31 — — —Total Exploration Expense$133 $66 $4 $7 $56Six Months Ended June 30, 2013        Dry Hole Cost$23 $15 $8 $— $—Seismic50 13 2 6 29Staff Expense58 12 4 2 40Other20 21 — — (1)Total Exploration Expense$151 $61 $14 $8 $68(1) West Africa includes Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and Sierra Leone.(2) Eastern Mediterranean includes Israel and Cyprus.(3) Other International includes the Falkland Islands and Nicaragua.Exploration expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 included:•seismic expense related to 3D seismic testing in the DJ Basin and Falkland Islands;

Segment Information.(2) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.34Table of Contents   Total DD&A expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 increased as compared with 2013 due to the following:•increase in the DJ Basin and the Marcellus Shale due to higher sales volumes associated with increased development activity;•increase in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to a new well producing at Ticonderoga and the addition of the Neptune spar at Swordfish; and•increase offshore Equatorial Guinea primarily due to the start up of the Alen field in the second half of 2013;partially offset by:•decrease due to sales of non-core onshore US properties in 2013; and•decrease offshore Israel related to the start up of the Tamar field at the end of first quarter 2013 which has a lower DD&A rate.The increase in the unit rate per BOE for the second quarter of 2014 as compared with 2013 was due primarily to the change in mix of production. Higher-cost production volumes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico were offset by lower cost volumes produced at Tamar, offshore Israel, which replaced higher cost volumes produced from the Mari-B, Noa and Pinnacles fields. The unit rate per BOE remained flat for the first six months of 2014 as compared with 2013.General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows: Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013G&A Expense (millions)$127 $104 $266 $216Unit Rate per BOE (1)$4.93 $4.48 $5.24 $4.86(1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.G&A expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 increased as compared with 2013 primarily due to additional expenses relating to personnel and office space in support of our major development projects and increased exploration activities. For example, our total number of employees increased from 2,190 at December 31, 2012, to 2,527 at December 31, 2013 and to just over 2,600 at June 30, 2014. An increase in the number of participants in our 401(k) savings plan, as a result of the planned termination of the defined benefit pension plan, resulted in an increase in payroll burden.Asset Impairment Expense Asset impairment expense was as follows: Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,(millions)2014 2013 2014 2013Asset Impairments$34 $— $131 $—See Item 1.

Income Taxes for a discussion of the change in our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 as compared with 2013.Discontinued OperationsThe North Sea geographical segment is reflected as discontinued operations for the first six months of 2013. During first quarter 2014, the remaining unsold North Sea assets were reclassified to held and used, and their operations are included in continuing operations for 2014.Summarized results of discontinued operations were as follows: Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2013  2013(millions)     Oil and Gas Sales $12  $21Expenses 7  17Income Before Income Taxes 5  4Income Tax Expense 3  10Operating (Income) Loss, Net of Tax 2  (6)Gain on Sale, Net of Tax 17  55Income From Discontinued Operations $19  $49      Key Statistics:     Daily Production     Crude Oil & Condensate (MBbl/d) 1  1Natural Gas (MMcf/d) 3  3Average Realized Price     Crude Oil & Condensate (Per Bbl) $103.21  $107.63Natural Gas (Per Mcf) 11.40  10.63Our long-term debt is recorded at the consolidated level and is not reflected by each component. Thus, we have not allocated interest expense to discontinued operations. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3. Divestitures.36Table of Contents   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCapital Structure/Financing StrategyIn seeking to effectively fund and monetize our discovered hydrocarbons, we employ a capital structure and financing strategy designed to provide sufficient liquidity throughout the volatile commodity price cycle. Specifically, we strive to retain the ability to fund long cycle, multi-year, capital intensive development projects throughout a range of scenarios, while also funding a robust exploration program and maintaining capacity to capitalize on financially attractive periodic mergers and acquisitions activity. We endeavor to maintain an investment grade debt rating in service of these objectives, while delivering competitive returns and a growing dividend. We utilize a commodity price hedging program to reduce the impacts of commodity price volatility and enhance the predictability of cash flows along with a risk and insurance program to protect against disruption to our cash flows and the funding of our business.We strive to maintain a minimum liquidity level to address volatility and risk. Traditional sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, and proceeds from sales of non-core properties. We may also access the capital markets to ensure adequate liquidity exists in the form of unutilized capacity under our Credit Facility or to refinance scheduled debt maturities. On April 15, 2014, we repaid $200 million of scheduled current maturities. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt and Credit Facility, below. Expanded development in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale, investment in our recently sanctioned major development projects, and our planned exploration and appraisal drilling activities are estimated to result in near term capital expenditures exceeding cash flows from operating activities. The extent to which capital investment will exceed operating cash flows depends on our success in sanctioning future development projects, the results of our exploration activities, and new business opportunities as well as external factors such as commodity prices, among others. Our financial capacity, coupled with our diversified portfolio, provides us with flexibility in our investment decisions including execution of our major development projects and increased exploration activity. To support our investment program, we expect that higher production resulting from our core onshore US development programs combined with new production from Tamar, which began producing in late first quarter 2013, and Alen, which began producing in late second quarter 2013, will result in an increase in cash flows which will be available to meet a substantial portion of future capital commitments. Cash on hand at June 30, 2014 totaled $958 million, and includes both domestic and foreign cash. We consider repatriating foreign cash to increase our financial flexibility and fund our capital investment program to the extent such cash is not required to fund foreign investment projects and would not incur material US tax. During the first six months of 2014, we repatriated $519 million from our UK operations. We will not incur material US tax on these repatriations.We also evaluate potential strategic farm-out arrangements of our working interests in Israel, Cyprus, Cameroon, Nicaragua and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for reimbursement of our capital spending in these areas. In addition, our current liquidity level and balance sheet, along with our ability to access the capital markets, provide flexibility. We believe that we are well-positioned to fund our long-term growth plans.We are currently evaluating potential development scenarios for our significant natural gas discoveries offshore Eastern Mediterranean, including Leviathan and Cyprus Block 12. The magnitude of these discoveries presents technical and financial challenges for us due to the large-scale development requirements. Potential development scenarios may include the construction of subsea pipeline, floating LNG, LNG terminals, FPSO or other options. Each of these development options would require a multi-billion dollar investment and require a number of years to complete. We are currently considering various project finance alternatives for Leviathan.Marcellus Shale Joint Venture Our joint venture arrangement with a subsidiary of CONSOL Energy, Inc. is structured in a manner to address partner alignment and financial affordability. Under the arrangement, we agreed to fund one-third of CONSOL's 50% working interest share of future drilling and completion costs up to a fixed amount. See Contractual Obligations, below.Pension Plan Termination We are in the process of terminating our defined benefit pension plan (pension plan). We expect to liquidate the associated pension obligation through lump-sum payments to participants or the purchase of annuities on their behalf. As of December 31, 2013, the latest actuarial measurement date for the pension plan, the accumulated benefit obligation totaled $315 million, and the fair value of plan assets was $265 million. At March 31, 2014, we reclassified the long-term portion of the net pension plan liability to current, as we expect final plan termination to occur by the end of first quarter 2015. We expect to make additional contributions to the plan during the period leading up to final termination and distribution to the extent necessary to fund these obligations. In addition, upon termination 37Table of Contents   of the pension plan, all unamortized prior service cost and net actuarial loss remaining in AOCL will be charged to expense. This amount totaled approximately $98 million as of June 30, 2014.In coordination with the termination of the pension plan, we also amended our restoration plan to freeze the accrual of benefits effective December 31, 2013. Payments under the restoration plan will continue to be made in ordinary course without acceleration. Restoration plan participants who remain employed by us upon final liquidation and distribution of assets of the pension plan may elect to have the lump sum present value of their restoration plan benefits converted into an account balance under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan.Available Liquidity Information regarding cash and debt balances is as follows: June 30, December 31, 2014 2013(millions, except percentages)   Cash and Cash Equivalents$958 $1,117Amount Available to be Borrowed Under Credit Facility (1)3,400 4,000Total Liquidity$4,358 $5,117Total Debt (2)$5,237 $4,843Total Shareholders' Equity9,554 9,184Ratio of Debt-to-Book Capital (3)35% 35%(1) See Credit Facility, below.(2) Total debt includes capital lease and other obligations and excludes unamortized debt discount.(3) We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes long-term debt excluding unamortized discount, the current portion of long-term debt, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.Cash and Cash Equivalents We had approximately $958 million in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2014, primarily denominated in US dollars and invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. Approximately $859 million of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries and a portion would be subject to US income taxes if repatriated. Credit Facility Our Credit Facility matures on October 3, 2018. The commitment is $4.0 billion through the maturity date of the Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2014, we had drawn $600 million under the Credit Facility to fund increased development activities. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings was 1.41%. Borrowings under our Credit Facility subject us to interest rate risk. See Item 1. Financial Statements –Note 6. Debt and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures.Commodity Derivative Instruments  We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs. Such instruments may include variable to fixed price commodity swaps, two-way collars, and/or three-way collars.Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. We net settle by counterparty based on netting provisions within the master agreements. None of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements. Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of June 30, 2014, the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $2 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $288 million (after consideration of netting provisions within our master agreements).  See Item 1. Financial Statements –Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of commodity derivative instruments and Credit Risk, below.Credit Risk We monitor the creditworthiness of our trade creditors, joint venture partners, hedging counterparties, and financial institutions on an ongoing basis. Some of these entities are not as creditworthy as we are and may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems. Counterparty credit downgrades or liquidity problems could result in a delay in our receiving proceeds from commodity sales, reimbursement of joint venture costs, and potential delays in our major development projects. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a party's creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict such sudden changes, our ability to negate these risks may be limited and we could incur significant financial losses. In addition, nonoperating partners often must obtain financing for their share of capital cost for development projects. A partner's inability to obtain financing could result in a delay of our joint development projects. For example, our Eastern Mediterranean partners must obtain financing for their share of significant development expenditures at Leviathan, offshore Israel, which potentially includes an LNG project and/or major underwater pipeline. 38Table of Contents   Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the form of parental guarantees, letters of credit or credit insurance; however, not all of our counterparty credit is protected through guarantees or credit support. Nonperformance by a trade creditor, joint venture partner, hedging counterparty or financial institution could result in significant financial losses.Contractual Obligations CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation The CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation represents our agreement to fund up to approximately $2.1 billion of CONSOL’s future drilling and completion costs. The CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation is expected to extend over a multi-year period and is capped at $400 million in each calendar year. The obligation is suspended if average Henry Hub natural gas prices fall and remain below $4.00 per MMBtu in any three consecutive month period and remain suspended until average Henry Hub natural gas prices are above $4.00 per MMBtu for three consecutive months. The carry terms ensure economic alignment with our partner in periods of low natural gas prices. Due to past low natural gas prices, the CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation was suspended from the end of 2011 to February 28, 2014. Due to recent increases in Henry Hub natural gas prices, we began funding a portion of CONSOL's working interest share of certain drilling and completion costs as of March 1, 2014. Based on the June 30, 2014, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price curve and current development plans, we forecast we will incur approximately $240 million under the CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation for 2014. The carry will be suspended again if average Henry Hub natural gas prices fall and remain below $4.00 per MMBtu in any future three consecutive month period. Marcellus Shale Firm Transportation Agreements In February 2014, we signed Precedent Agreements for Firm Transportation to move 150,000 MMBtu per day of our Marcellus Shale natural gas production to Gulf Coast markets. Our financial commitment is approximately $765 million, undiscounted, over a 15-year period, beginning in 2017. Cash FlowsCash flow information is as follows: Six Months EndedJune 30, 2014 2013(millions)   Total Cash Provided By (Used in)   Operating Activities$1,757 $1,244Investing Activities(2,215) (1,835)Financing Activities299 (90)Decrease in Cash and Cash Equivalents$(159) $(681)Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2014 increased as compared with 2013. Higher crude oil and natural gas sales prices and an increase in crude oil and natural gas sales volumes were offset by increases in production expenses and general and administrative expense. Working capital changes contributed $105 million of positive operating cash flow in the first six months of 2014 as compared with a negative impact of $168 million in the first six months of 2013.Investing Activities Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method. These investing activities may be offset by proceeds from property sales or dispositions, including farm-in arrangements, which may result in reimbursement for capital spending that had occurred in prior periods. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment increased by $392 million during the first six months of 2014 as compared with 2013, primarily due to increased major project development activity in our core areas. We also invested $40 million in CONE Gathering LLC (CONE), discussed below, during the first six months of 2014. We received $146 million in proceeds from non-core asset divestitures during the first six months of 2014, as compared with $114 million during the same period in 2013. Financing Activities  Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first six months of 2014, funds were provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($58 million) and net cash proceeds from our Credit Facility ($600 million). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($116 million), to repay Senior Notes that were due April 15, 2014 ($200 million), make principal payments related to capital lease obligations ($28 million) and repurchase shares of our common stock ($15 million).In comparison, during the first six months of 2013, funds were provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($43 million). We also used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($96 million), make 39Table of Contents   principal payments related to the Aseng FPSO capital lease obligation ($23 million) and repurchase shares of our common stock ($14 million).See Item 1. Financial Statements – Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Investing ActivitiesAcquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures  Information for investing activities (on an accrual basis) is as follows: Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30, 2014 2013 2014 2013(millions)       Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures       Unproved Property Acquisition (1)$74 $97 $129 $134Exploration138 197 228 385Development (2)989 749 1,736 1,374Corporate and Other 43 89 90 124Total$1,244 $1,132 $2,183 $2,017        Other       Investment in Equity Method Investee (3)$28 $3 $40 $23Increase in Capital Lease Obligations16 31 21 36(1) Unproved property acquisition cost for 2014 includes $37 million in the DJ Basin, $75 million in the Marcellus Shale, and $16 million in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Unproved property acquisition cost for 2013 includes $73 million in the DJ Basin, $47 million in the Marcellus Shale, and $12 million in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.(2) Development expenditures for 2014 include drilling rig mobilization charges of $55 million, a portion of which will be billed to partners in future periods as the rig is utilized.(3) Investment in equity method investees represents funding of our investment in CONE which owns and operates the natural gas gathering infrastructure associated with our Marcellus Shale joint venture.Total expenditures increased in 2014 as compared with 2013 due to accelerated activity in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale. Financing ActivitiesLong-Term Debt Our principal source of liquidity is our Credit Facility that matures October 3, 2018. At June 30, 2014, $600 million was outstanding under the Credit Facility, leaving $3.4 billion available for use. We expect to use the Credit Facility to fund our capital investment program, and may periodically borrow amounts for working capital purposes. See Item 1 Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt.Our outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding capital lease and other obligations) totaled approximately $4.3 billion at June 30, 2014. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 6.09%, with maturities ranging from March 2019 to August 2097. On April 15, 2014, we repaid $200 million of matured fixed rate debt.Dividends We paid total cash dividends of 32 cents per share of our common stock during the first six months of 2014 and 27 cents per share during the first six months of 2013 (as adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split during the second quarter of 2013). On July 22, 2014, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per common share, which will be paid August 18, 2014 to shareholders of record on August 4, 2014. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.Exercise of Stock Options We received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $41 million during the first six months of 2014 and $31 million during the first six months of 2013.Common Stock Repurchases We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 250,013 shares with a value of $15 million during the first six months of 2014 and 247,985 shares with a value of $14 million during the first six months of 2013. 40Table of Contents   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskCommodity Price RiskDerivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.At June 30, 2014, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps and three-way collars related to crude oil and natural gas sales. Changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value of $286 million. Based on the June 30, 2014 published commodity futures price curves for the underlying commodities, a hypothetical price increase of $1.00 per Bbl for crude oil would increase the fair value of our net commodity derivative liability by approximately $41 million. A hypothetical price increase of $0.10 per MMBtu for natural gas would increase the fair value of our net commodity derivative liability by approximately $10 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.Interest Rate RiskChanges in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our Credit Facility and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.At June 30, 2014, we had approximately $4.9 billion (excluding capital lease and other obligations) of long-term debt outstanding. Of this amount, $4.3 billion was fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.09%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss.The remainder of our long-term debt, $600 million at June 30, 2014, was variable-rate debt. Variable-rate debt exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to increases in market interest rates. We estimate that a hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the June 30, 2014 balance of our variable-rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $2 million.We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances. As of June 30, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $958 million, approximately 40% of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. A hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the amount invested as of June 30, 2014 would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately $1 million.Foreign Currency RiskThe US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as taxes payable in foreign tax jurisdictions, are settled in the foreign local currency. A reduction in the value of the US dollar against currencies of other countries in which we have material operations could result in the use of additional cash to settle operating, administrative, and tax liabilities. Net transaction gains and losses were de minimis for the second quarter and the first six months of both 2014 and 2013.We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determine that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:•our growth strategies;•our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;•anticipated trends in our business;41Table of Contents   •our future results of operations;•our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;•market conditions in the oil and gas industry;•our ability to make and integrate acquisitions;•the impact of governmental fiscal terms and/or regulation, such as those involving the protection of the environment or marketing of production, as well as other regulations; and•access to resources.Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 is available on our website at www.nobleenergyinc.com.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresBased on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.42Part II. Other InformationItem 1. Legal ProceedingsWest Virginia Matter In March 2013, we received seven Notices of Violation (NOV) and two Administrative Orders (Orders) from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection Office of Oil and Gas (OOG) regarding the unintentional discharge of a mixture of freshwater and produced water that occurred on or about the evening of February 22, 2013 from one of our permitted water storage facilities in Marshall County, West Virginia. At this time, the OOG has not established a proposed penalty for these NOVs or Orders. Given the uncertainty in administrative actions of this nature, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this action at this time. However, we believe that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Item 1A. Risk FactorsThere have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Item 2.
