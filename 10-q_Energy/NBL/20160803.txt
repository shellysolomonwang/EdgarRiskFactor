Item 1A. Risk Factors.Producing Properties In 2016, leading commodity indices, including WTI, Brent and HH continue to trade lower than prior years and remain volatile. A further decline in future crude oil, natural gas or NGL prices could result in some of our properties becoming uneconomic, resulting in additional impairment charges, decrease in proved reserves and/or shut-in of currently producing wells.In second quarter 2016, we assessed proved properties for possible impairment due to current commodity prices. While the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our properties, including certain of our offshore assets, did not indicate an impairment at June 30, 2016, certain properties may become impaired if, for example, commodity prices decline further, operating or development costs increase, or estimated proved reserves are revised downward.In addition, in certain onshore US areas, transportation bottlenecks caused by oversupply and/or lack of infrastructure can reduce the amount of production reaching higher priced out-of-basin locations, resulting in less favorable basis differentials, or differences between WTI and HH pricing and the average prices we actually receive. A worsening of these basis differentials could also reduce cash flows and result in property impairment charges.The cash flow model that we use to assess proved properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as management’s estimates of future crude oil and natural gas production along with operating and development costs, market outlook on forward commodity prices, and interest rates. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date of estimate. However, a decrease in forward commodity prices, or widening of basis differentials, alone could result in an impairment.In addition, well decommissioning programs, especially in deepwater or remote locations, are often complex and expensive. It may be difficult to estimate timing of actual abandonment activities, which are subject to regulatory approval and the availability of rigs and services. It may be difficult to estimate costs of rigs and services in periods of fluctuating demand. In addition, we do not operate certain assets and therefore we work with respective operators to receive updated estimates of abandonment activities and costs. As such, our ARO estimates may change, sometimes significantly, and could result in asset impairment and/or have other financial impacts. Divestments We actively manage our asset portfolio. If properties are reclassified as assets held for sale in the future, they will be valued at the lower of net book value or anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell. Impairment expense would be recorded for any excess of net book value over anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell.33Table of Contents   RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenuesRevenues were as follows:     (Decrease) / Increase from Prior Year(millions)2016 2015 Three Months Ended June 30,     Oil, Gas and NGL Sales$823 $732 12%Income from Equity Method Investees24 6 300%Total$847 $738 15%      Six Months Ended June 30,     Oil, Gas and NGL Sales$1,528 $1,481 3%Income from Equity Method Investees43 24 79%Total$1,571 $1,505 4%Changes in revenues are discussed below.Oil, Gas and NGL Sales We generally sell crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs under two types of agreements common in our industry. Both types of agreements may include transportation charges. One type of agreement is a netback agreement, under which we sell crude oil and natural gas at the wellhead and receive a price, net of transportation expense incurred by the purchaser. In the case of NGLs, we may receive a price from the purchaser, which is net of fractionation and processing costs. Historically, we have recorded revenue at the net price we had received from the purchaser, net of transportation, fractionation or processing costs. Beginning in 2016, we changed our presentation of revenue to no longer include expenses netted from revenue by the purchaser. Crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales are now shown without deductions relating to transportation, fractionation or processing. These deductions are now recorded as production expense. Prior year amounts, including revenues, expenses, average realized sales prices and average production costs per BOE, have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. For NGL sales, amounts reclassified for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $10 million and $19 million, respectively. Amounts reclassified for crude oil and natural gas sales were de minimis. In addition, commodity prices we receive may be reduced by location basis differentials, which can be significant. For example, transportation bottlenecks and oversupply in the Marcellus Shale have reduced the amount of production reaching higher priced out-of-basin locations. As a result of location basis differentials, our reported sales prices may differ significantly from published commodity price benchmarks for the same period. 34Table of Contents   Average daily sales volumes and average realized sales prices were as follows: Sales Volumes Average Realized Sales Prices Crude Oil & Condensate(MBbl/d) NaturalGas(MMcf/d) NGLs(MBbl/d) Total(MBoe/d) (1) Crude Oil & Condensate(Per Bbl) NaturalGas(Per Mcf) NGLs(Per Bbl)Three Months Ended June 30, 2016United States96 924 59 309 $40.64 $1.75 $14.10Equatorial Guinea (2)27 233 — 66 44.55 0.27 —Israel— 276 — 46 — 5.15 —Total Consolidated Operations123 1,433 59 421 41.51 2.16 14.10Equity Investees (3)1 — 5 6 49.94 — 27.64Total124 1,433 64 427 $41.61 $2.16 $15.07Three Months Ended June 30, 2015United States65 613 27 194 $52.44 $1.90 $13.71Equatorial Guinea (2)31 202 — 65 60.02 0.27 —Israel — 215 — 36 — 5.34 —Total Consolidated Operations96 1,030 27 295 54.91 2.30 13.71Equity Investees (3)1 — 3 4 60.34 — 33.34Total97 1,030 30 299 $54.95 $2.30 $15.70              Six Months Ended June 30, 2016United States99 917 56 308 $35.22 $1.82 $12.73Equatorial Guinea (2)27 214 — 63 39.53 0.27 —Israel— 271 — 45 — 5.17 —Total Consolidated Operations126 1,402 56 416 36.14 2.23 12.73Equity Investees (3)1 — 4 6 42.34 — 25.02Total127 1,402 60 422 $36.20 $2.23 $13.63Six Months Ended June 30, 2015United States69 616 26 198 $48.20 $2.31 $16.11Equatorial Guinea (2)30 216 — 66 54.97 0.27 —Israel— 229 — 38 — 5.40 —Other International (4)1 — — 1 55.52 — —Total Consolidated Operations100 1,061 26 303 50.29 2.56 16.11Equity Investees (3)1 — 4 6 51.86 — 31.27Total101 1,061 30 309 $50.31 $2.56 $18.33(1) Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of crude oil equivalent. This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given commodity price disparities, the price for a barrel of crude oil equivalent for US natural gas and NGLs are significantly less than the price for a barrel of crude oil. In Israel, we sell natural gas under contracts where the majority of the price is fixed, resulting in less commodity price disparity.(2) Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant, an LNG plant and a power generation plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned in part by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.(3) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the LPG plant in Equatorial Guinea.

Equity method investments are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets, and our share of earnings is reported as income from equity method investees in our consolidated statements of operations. Within our consolidated statements of cash flows, activity is reflected within cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities. Income from equity method investees increased $19 million during the first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase primarily includes a $12 million increase from Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO), our methanol investee, which experienced a 45-day plant turnaround during first quarter 2015; a $5 million decrease from Alba Plant, our 36Table of Contents   LPG investee, due to lower realized prices; an increase of $10 million from our investments in CONE Gathering LLC and CONE Midstream Partners due primarily to higher throughput volumes; and an increase of $2 million from other investments.Operating Costs and ExpensesOperating costs and expenses were as follows:     Increase / (Decrease)from Prior Year(millions)2016 2015 Three Months Ended June 30,     Production Expense$274 $218 26 %Exploration Expense89 41 117 %Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization622 451 38 %General and Administrative107 104 3 %Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net17 85 (80)%Total$1,109 $899 23 %      Six Months Ended June 30,     Production Expense$546 $469 16 %Exploration Expense252 106 138 %Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization1,239 905 37 %General and Administrative198 198 — %Other Operating Expense, Net20 121 (83)%Total$2,255 $1,799 25 %Changes in operating costs and expenses are discussed below.37Table of Contents   Production Expense Components of production expense were as follows:(millions, except unit rate)Total per BOE (1) Total UnitedStates Equatorial Guinea Israel Corporate Three Months Ended June 30, 2016           Lease Operating Expense (2)$3.11 $119 $86 $24 $7 $2Production and Ad Valorem Taxes1.04 40 40 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense  (3)3.00 115 115 — — —Total Production Expense$7.15 $274 $241 $24 $7 $2Total Production Expense per BOE  $7.15 $8.58 $3.99 $1.66 N/MThree Months Ended June 30, 2015           Lease Operating Expense (2)$4.80 $129 $80 $36 $12 $1Production and Ad Valorem Taxes1.05 28 28 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense  (3)2.27 61 61 — — —Total Production Expense$8.12 $218 $169 $36 $12 $1Total Production Expense per BOE  $8.12 $9.55 $6.15 $3.65 N/MSix Months Ended June 30, 2016           Lease Operating Expense (2)$3.71 $281 $207 $53 $17 $4Production and Ad Valorem Taxes0.57 43 43 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense  (3)2.93 222 222 — — —Total Production Expense$7.21 $546 $472 $53 $17 $4Total Production Expense per BOE  $7.21 $8.43 $4.63 $2.05 N/MSix Months Ended June 30, 2015           Lease Operating Expense (2)$5.21 $286 $182 $70 $25 $9Production and Ad Valorem Taxes1.11 61 61 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense (3)2.22 122 122 — — —Total Production Expense$8.54 $469 $365 $70 $25 $9Total Production Expense per BOE  $8.54 $10.20 $5.83 $3.59 N/MN/M amount is not meaningful. (1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.(2) Lease operating expense includes oil and gas operating costs (labor, fuel, repairs, replacements, saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs) and workover expense.(3) Certain of our revenue received from purchasers was historically presented with deduction for transportation, fractionation or processing costs. Beginning in 2016, we have changed our presentation of revenue to no longer include these expenses as deductions from revenue. These costs are now included within production expense and prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. See Results of Operations – Revenues, above.For second quarter and the first six months of 2016, total production expense increased as compared with 2015 due to the following: •an increase in lease operating and transportation and gathering expense due to higher production, including the addition of onshore US production from our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets acquired in third quarter 2015 and from our Big Bend and Dantzler development projects, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which began producing in fourth quarter 2015;partially offset by: •a decrease in lease operating expense due to continued focus on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives; and•a decrease in production and ad valorem taxes resulting from lower revenues and an onshore US severance tax receivable, both driven by a decline in US commodity prices. The unit rate per BOE for total production expense decreased for three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to cost reduction initiatives in lease operating expense, and lower production and ad valorem taxes as a result of the pricing environment. The decrease in unit rate per BOE was partially offset by the increase in transportation and gathering expense primarily due to the addition of our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets in third quarter 2015 and an increase in production in the Marcellus Shale. 38Table of Contents   Exploration Expense Components of exploration expense were as follows:(millions)Total United States West  Africa (1) Eastern Mediter-ranean (2) Other Int'l, Corporate (3)Three Months Ended June 30, 2016        Leasehold Impairment and Amortization$16 $16 $— $— $—Dry Hole Expense27 — — 27 —Seismic, Geological and Geophysical 23 — 10 — 13Staff Expense21 20 1 — —Other (4)2 6 (1) — (3)Total Exploration Expense$89 $42 $10 $27 $10Three Months Ended June 30, 2015        Leasehold Impairment and Amortization$14 $14 $— $— $—Staff Expense18 3 2 1 12Other (4)9 — 3 1 5Total Exploration Expense$41 $17 $5 $2 $17          Six Months Ended June 30, 2016        Leasehold Impairment and Amortization$31 $31 $— $— $—Dry Hole Expense114 91 (1) 27 (3)Seismic, Geological and Geophysical 32 — 10 — 22Staff Expense39 21 2 1 15Other (4)36 23 — 7 6Total Exploration Expense$252 $166 $11 $35 $40Six Months Ended June 30, 2015        Leasehold Impairment and Amortization$26 $21 $— $5 $—Dry Hole Expense19 18 1 — —Seismic, Geological and Geophysical 2 2 — — —Staff Expense50 10 2 3 35Other (4)9 — — 1 8Total Exploration Expense$106 $51 $3 $9 $43(1) West Africa includes Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, Sierra Leone (which we exited in second quarter 2015), and Gabon.(2) Eastern Mediterranean includes Israel and Cyprus.(3) Other International, Corporate includes the Falkland Islands, other new ventures and corporate expenditures.(4) Includes lease rentals and other exploratory costs. Exploration expense for second quarter and the first six months of 2016 included:•dry hole cost primarily related to the Silvergate exploratory well, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Dolphin 1 natural gas discovery, offshore Israel; •seismic expense related to the acquisition of 3D seismic data in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and other international areas; •Other cost for US includes lease rentals primarily related to Permian Basin leases; and•salaries and related expenses for corporate exploration and new ventures personnel.Exploration expense for second quarter and the first six months of 2015 included the following:•dry hole cost related primarily to onshore US exploratory wells; and•salaries and related expenses for corporate exploration and new ventures personnel. 39Table of Contents   Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD&A expense was as follows: Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015DD&A Expense (millions) (1)$622 $451 $1,239 $905Unit Rate per BOE (2)$16.23 $16.77 $16.37 $16.50(1) For DD&A expense by geographical area, see Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 12. Segment Information.(2) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.Total DD&A expense for second quarter and the first six months of 2016 increased as compared with 2015 due to the following:•the addition of Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin production in third quarter 2015, resulting in $98 million and $18 million in DD&A expense respectively, during the first six months of 2016;•an increase in the Marcellus Shale, Eastern Mediterranean and deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to higher sales volumes;•a reduction in proved reserves in fourth quarter 2015 primarily due to downward price revisions in DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale; partially offset by:•a decrease in sales volumes offshore Equatorial Guinea due to downtime installing the B3 compression platform and scheduled maintenance in the Alba field; and •the impact of lower net book value as a result of a fourth quarter 2015 impairment for offshore Equatorial Guinea properties.The decrease in the unit rate per BOE for the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015 was due primarily to increased lower-cost production volumes from certain onshore US properties and the Tamar and Alba fields. The decrease in the unit rate per BOE was partially offset by an increase in higher-cost production volumes in deepwater Gulf of Mexico and reductions in proved reserves in fourth quarter 2015 mainly due to downward price revisions.Significant changes to the proved reserves at December 31, 2015 include; additions of 269 MMBoe resulting from the Rosetta Merger during the third quarter 2015 offset by downward revisions of 307 MMBoe that were commodity price driven. Estimates of proved reserves significantly affect our DD&A expense. Holding other factors constant, a decline in proved reserves estimates caused by decreases in the 12-month average commodity prices, will result in an increase in DD&A expense in future periods, which would reduce earnings.

The decrease in the unit rate per BOE for the second quarter and the first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015 was due primarily to the increase in production volumes in onshore US, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and Eastern Mediterranean; and cost synergies achieved through the Rosetta Merger. 40Table of Contents   Other Operating (Income) Expense Other operating (income) expense was as follows: Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,(millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Loss on Asset Due to Terminated Contract$5 $— $47 $—Marketing and Processing Expense, Net15 12 37 22Loss (Gain) on Divestitures23 (1) 23 —Corporate Restructuring Expense— 18 1 18Purchase Price Allocation Adjustment(25) — (25) —Gain on Extinguishment of Debt — — (80) —Asset Impairments — 15 — 43Pension Plan Expense— 21 — 21Stacked Drilling Rig Expense3 7 5 7Other, Net (4) 13 12 10Total$17 $85 $20 $121See Item 1.

See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 6. Debt.The decrease in capitalized interest for second quarter and the first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015 is primarily due to lower work in progress amounts related to major long-term projects in deepwater Gulf of Mexico (due to the Big Bend and Dantzler development projects that were completed in fourth quarter 2015, partially offset by the Gunflint development project that was completed July 2016), offshore Cyprus (due to the farm-out agreement with a partner for a 35% interest in Block 12 41Table of Contents   during fourth quarter 2015), offshore Falkland Islands (due to the Humpback prospect that began drilling operations in June 2015 and was determined to be a dry hole during fourth quarter 2015), and timing of onshore US activities.

Income Taxes for a discussion of the change in our effective tax rate for second quarter and the first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCapital Structure/Financing StrategyIn seeking to effectively fund and monetize our discovered hydrocarbons, we employ a capital structure and financing strategy designed to provide sufficient liquidity throughout the volatile commodity price cycle, including the current commodity price environment. Specifically, we strive to retain the ability to fund long cycle, multi-year, capital intensive development projects throughout a range of scenarios, while also funding a continuing exploration program and maintaining capacity to capitalize on financially attractive periodic mergers and acquisitions activity. We endeavor to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade debt rating in service of these objectives. We utilize a commodity price hedging program to reduce the impacts of commodity price volatility and enhance the predictability of cash flows along with a risk and insurance program to protect against disruption to our cash flows and the funding of our business.We strive to maintain a minimum liquidity level to address volatility and risk. Traditional sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, and proceeds from sales of non-core properties. We occasionally access the capital markets to ensure adequate liquidity exists in the form of unutilized capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility or to refinance scheduled debt maturities. On January 6, 2016, we entered into the Term Loan Facility which provides for a three-year term loan facility for a principal amount of $1.4 billion. In connection with the Term Loan Facility, we launched cash tender offers for certain Senior Notes assumed in the Rosetta Merger. The borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used solely to fund the tender offers. Collectively, the result of these transactions provides for significant future interest expense savings with a shorter term debt maturity. While we have no near-term debt maturities, we may seek to access the capital markets to refinance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness. As of June 30, 2016, we had $7.5 billion of long-term debt outstanding, $2.4 billion of which is due first quarter 2019. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt.In addition, we evaluate potential strategic farm-out arrangements of our working interests for reimbursement of our capital spending and may consider non-core asset sales or other sources of funding. Furthermore, as required by the Israel Natural Gas Framework, we are required to divest certain of our interests within a stipulated period of time. During first half 2016, we received cash proceeds of approximately $767 million primarily from our divestment of certain onshore US assets primarily in the DJ Basin, our Cyprus farm-out and the sale of our Karish and Tanin discoveries offshore Israel. On July 4, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement to divest a 3% interest in the Tamar field, offshore Israel, for $369 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.Cash on hand at June 30, 2016 totaled approximately $1.3 billion, which includes both domestic and foreign cash, and there were no amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility, below. Our nearly 60% reduction in capital spending during the first six months of 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015, coupled with operating efficiencies to increase production at lower costs, has allowed us to closely align capital spending with our operating cash flows. We will continue our effort to invest capital at a level supported by current operating cash flows. Our financial capacity and lack of near-term debt maturities, coupled with our diversified global portfolio, provides us with flexibility in our investment decisions including execution of our major development projects and exploration activity. To support our investment program, we expect that production resulting from our core onshore US development programs, combined with new production from the Big Bend and Dantzler development projects, which began producing in fourth quarter 2015, and from the Gunflint development, which began producing in July 2016, as well as completion of the Alba B3 compression project, which commenced production in July 2016, and presuming no significant further deterioration of prices, will result in cash flows which will be available to meet a portion of future capital commitments in 2016 and subsequent years. See Results of Operations above.We are currently evaluating potential development and/or financing scenarios for our significant natural gas discoveries offshore Eastern Mediterranean. The magnitude of these discoveries presents technical and financial challenges for us due to 42Table of Contents   the large-scale development requirements. Each of these development options, including the development of Leviathan infrastructure to supply domestic and regional demands, would require a multi-billion dollar investment and require a number of years to complete. We received approval from the Government of Israel of a revised stability provision as part of the Israel Natural Gas Framework which is another key milestone in progressing the Leviathan project to development sanction. See Update on Israel Natural Gas Regulatory Framework, above.Available Liquidity Information regarding cash and debt balances is as follows: June 30, December 31,(millions, except percentages)2016 2015Cash and Cash Equivalents$1,300 $1,028Amount Available to be Borrowed Under Revolving Credit Facility (1)4,000 4,000Total Liquidity$5,300 $5,028Total Debt (2)$7,966 $7,976Total Shareholders' Equity9,713 10,370Ratio of Debt-to-Book Capital (3)45% 43%(1) See Revolving Credit Facility, below.(2) Total debt includes capital lease obligations and excludes unamortized debt discount/premium.(3) We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes long-term debt excluding unamortized discount, the current portion of long-term debt, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.Cash and Cash Equivalents We had approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016, primarily denominated in US dollars and invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. Approximately $347 million of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries. We have recorded a related deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings for the future additional US tax liability for the US and foreign tax rate differences, net of estimated foreign tax credit.Revolving Credit Facility Our Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 27, 2020. The commitment is $4.0 billion through the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility subject us to interest rate risk. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Commodity Derivative Instruments  We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs. Such instruments may include variable to fixed price commodity swaps, two-way collars, three-way collars, swaptions and enhanced swaps.Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. We net settle by counterparty based on netting provisions within the master agreements. None of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements. Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of June 30, 2016, the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $229 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $66 million (after consideration of netting provisions within our master agreements). See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of commodity derivative instruments, and Credit Risk, below.Credit Risk We monitor the creditworthiness of our trade creditors, joint venture partners, hedge counterparties, and financial institutions on an ongoing basis. Counterparty credit downgrades or liquidity problems could result in a delay in our receiving proceeds from commodity sales, reimbursement of joint venture costs, and potential delays in our major development projects. As operator of the joint ventures, we pay joint venture expenses and make cash calls on our non-operating partners for their respective shares of joint venture costs. Our projects are capital cost intensive and, in some cases, a non-operating partner may experience a delay in obtaining financing for its share of the joint venture costs or have liquidity problems resulting in slow payment of joint venture costs. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of a joint venture partner, we may be required to complete their share of remediation activities or fulfill their lease obligations which could result in significant financial losses.We are unable to predict sudden changes in a party's creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict such sudden changes, our ability to negate these risks may be limited and we could incur significant financial losses.Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the form of parental guarantees, letters of credit or credit insurance; however, not all of our counterparty credit is protected through guarantees or credit support. In addition, we maintain 43Table of Contents   credit insurance associated with specific purchasers. However, nonperformance by a trade creditor, joint venture partner, hedge counterparty or financial institution could result in significant financial losses.Contractual Obligations Marcellus Shale Joint Development Agreement  The joint development agreement for our jointly owned Marcellus Shale acreage provides for a multi-year drilling and development plan (default plan). We and CONSOL have agreed to an annual plan that provides for fewer wells to be drilled than the number of wells that was provided for in the default plan, and, for 2016, the amount of capital investment allocated to the Marcellus Shale core area will be less than the amount provided for in the default plan. Each of us has a non-consent right, which is the right to elect not to participate in all (but not less than all) of the operations provided for the following year. If one of us elects to exercise the non-consent right, then the other partner, in its sole discretion, may determine the number of wells, if any, it will drill in such year, which may be significantly less than the number of wells that was provided for in the default plan, or none at all. In the event we elect to exercise our non-consent right for a given year, we would still have to pay the carried costs that are contemplated by the development plan for that non-consent year. Under the joint development agreement, this non-consent right may be exercised by each partner twice (in non-consecutive years) prior to the termination of the default plan at the end of 2020. Neither of us has exercised the non-consent right, and thus, each of us may still elect to exercise the non-consent right twice (in non-consecutive years) prior to the end of 2020.CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies.Exploration Commitments The terms of some of our production sharing contracts, licenses or concession agreements may require us to conduct certain exploration activities, including drilling one or more exploratory wells or acquiring seismic data, within specific time periods. These obligations can extend over periods of several years, and failure to conduct such exploration activities within the prescribed periods could lead to loss of leases or exploration rights. Continuous Development Obligations Although the majority of our assets are held by production, certain of our onshore US assets are held through continuous development obligations. Therefore, we are contractually obligated to fund a level of development activity in these areas and failure to meet these obligations may result in the loss of a lease. Our 2016 capital program allows for managing these obligations.Delivery and Firm Transportation Agreements We have entered into various long-term gathering, processing, transportation and delivery contracts for some of our onshore US crude oil and natural gas production. These contracts may commit us to deliver minimum volumes and require us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting the minimum volumes under the commitments. We may use long-term contracts such as these, which may range in term from one to 40 years, to provide flow assurance for production in over-supplied basins with constrained infrastructure, such as currently in the Marcellus Shale, and to enable our production to reach higher priced out-of-basin locations.Although we strive to schedule well completion activities to meet the minimum volumes under the commitments, we may experience temporary, and possibly prolonged, delivery or transportation shortfalls. During first half 2016, we incurred expense of approximately $23 million related to deficiencies and/or unutilized commitments. We expect to continue to incur deficiency and/or unutilized costs in the near-term as development activities continue. For full year 2016, we estimate these costs could range from approximately $45 million to $55 million. Should commodity prices continue to remain low or decline further, or we are unable to continue to develop our properties as planned, or certain wells become uneconomic and are shut-in, we could incur additional shortfalls in delivering or transporting the minimum volumes under these commitments. In the event that these commitments are not otherwise offset, we could be required to make future payments for any shortfalls. While we continually seek to optimize under-utilized assets through capacity release and third-party arrangements, as well as, for example, through the shifting of transportation of production from rail cars to pipelines when we receive a higher netback price, we may continue to experience these shortfalls both in the near and long-term. Credit Rating Events   We do not have any triggering events on our corporate debt that would cause a default in case of a downgrade of our credit rating. In addition, there are no existing ratings triggers in any of our commodity hedging agreements that would require the posting of collateral. However, a series of downgrades or other negative rating actions could increase our cost of financing, and may increase our requirements to post collateral as financial assurance of performance under certain other contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts, crude oil and natural gas sales contracts, work commitments and certain abandonment obligations. A requirement to post collateral could have a negative impact on our liquidity.44Table of Contents   Cash FlowsCash flow information is as follows: Six Months EndedJune 30, (millions)2016 2015Total Cash Provided By (Used in)   Operating Activities$440 $966Investing Activities(51) (1,812)Financing Activities(117) 941Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents$272 $95Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the first six months of 2016 decreased significantly as compared with 2015. Decreases in average realized commodity prices and lower settlements of commodity derivative instruments were partially offset by increases in sales volumes. Working capital changes resulted in a $381 million operating cash flow reduction in the first six months of 2016 as compared with a positive impact of $34 million in the first six months of 2015.Investing Activities Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method. These investing activities may be offset by proceeds from property sales or dispositions, including farm-out arrangements, which may result in reimbursement for capital spending that had occurred in prior periods. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment decreased by $1.09 billion during the first six months of 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to a reduced capital spending program. Investing activities included $6 million in CONE Gathering LLC during the first six months of 2016 as compared with $65 million in the same period of 2015. We received $767 million in proceeds from asset divestitures during the first six months of 2016, as compared with $151 million during the same period in 2015. Financing Activities  Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first six months of 2016, funds were provided by cash proceeds from the term loan acquisition ($1.4 billion). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($86 million), fund the purchase of certain of our outstanding senior notes ($1.38 billion), and make principal payments related to capital lease obligations ($27 million).In comparison, during the first six months of 2015, funds were provided by cash proceeds from the issuance of shares of Company common stock to the public ($1.1 billion). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($134 million) and make principal payments related to capital lease obligations ($29 million).See Item 1. Financial Statements – Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Investing ActivitiesAcquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures  Information for investing activities (on an accrual basis) is as follows: Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,(millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures       Property Acquisition (1)$23 $39 $42 $65Exploration58 71 156 140Development166 593 394 1,237Midstream5 39 20 97Corporate and Other 10 36 20 59Total$262 $778 $632 $1,598Other       Investment in Equity Method Investee (2)$— $21 $6 $65Increase in Capital Lease Obligations$— $8 $— $31(1) Property acquisition cost for 2016 includes $17 million in the DJ Basin, $16 million in the Marcellus Shale, $4 million in the Permian Basin and $3 million in the Eagle Ford Shale.

See Operating Outlook – 2016 Capital Investment Program, above. Financing ActivitiesLong-Term Debt Our principal source of liquidity is our Revolving Credit Facility that matures August 27, 2020. At June 30, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $4.0 billion available for use. We may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility to help fund our capital investment program, and may periodically borrow amounts for working capital purposes. On January 6, 2016, we entered into the Term Loan Facility with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., as syndication agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto, which provides for a three-year term loan facility for a principal amount of $1.4 billion. In connection with the Term Loan Facility, we launched cash tender offers for certain Senior Notes assumed in the Rosetta Merger. The borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used solely to fund the tender offers. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt.Our outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding capital lease obligations) totaled approximately $6.1 billion at June 30, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 5.69%, with maturities ranging from March 2019 to August 2097.Dividends We paid total cash dividends of 20 cents per share of common stock during the first six months of 2016 as compared with 36 cents per share during the first six months of 2015.On July 26, 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 10 cents per common share, which will be paid on August 22, 2016 to shareholders of record on August 8, 2016. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.Exercise of Stock Options We received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $7 million during the first six months of 2016 and $4 million during the first six months of 2015.Common Stock Repurchases We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 232,870 shares with a value of $8 million during the first six months of 2016 and 253,597 shares with a value of $12 million during the first six months of 2015. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskCommodity Price RiskDerivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.At June 30, 2016, we had various open commodity derivative instruments related to crude oil and natural gas. Changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of $163 million. Based on the June 30, 2016 published commodity futures price curves for the underlying commodities, a hypothetical price increase of $10.00 per Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by approximately $190 million. A hypothetical price increase of $0.50 per MMBtu for natural gas would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by approximately $44 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.Interest Rate RiskChanges in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.At June 30, 2016, we had approximately $7.5 billion (excluding capital lease obligations) of long-term debt, net, outstanding. Of this amount, $6.1 billion was fixed-rate debt, net, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.69%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to interest rate risk or cash flow loss.However, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances. As of June 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled nearly $1.3 billion, approximately 48% of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. In addition, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to variable interest rates which expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to potential increases in market 46Table of Contents   interest rates. A change in the interest rate applicable to our variable-rate debt could expose us to additional interest cost. While we currently have no interest rate derivative instruments as of June 30, 2016, we may invest in such instruments in the future in order to mitigate interest rate risk. A change in the interest rate applicable to our short-term investments would have a de minimis impact. Foreign Currency RiskThe US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as taxes payable in foreign tax jurisdictions, are settled in the foreign local currency. A reduction in the value of the US dollar against currencies of other countries in which we have material operations could result in the use of additional cash to settle operating, administrative, and tax liabilities. Net transaction gains and losses were de minimis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determine that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:•our growth strategies;•our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;•anticipated trends in our business;•our future results of operations;•our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;•market conditions in the oil and gas industry;•our ability to make and integrate acquisitions;•the impact of governmental fiscal terms and/or regulation, such as those involving the protection of the environment or marketing of production, as well as other regulations; and•access to resources.Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 is available on our website at www.nobleenergyinc.com.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresBased on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)), are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.47Part II. Other InformationItem 1. Legal ProceedingsSee discussion of legal proceedings in Part I. Financial Information, Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II. Item 1, as well as discussion in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Item 1A. Risk FactorsThere have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, other than the following:Certain proposed ballot measures considered in Colorado seek to vastly expand the right of local governments to regulate and dictate location parameters of future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development activities, and/or limit or prohibit crude oil and natural gas production and development activities in their jurisdictions. If these measures are approved and implemented, they could have material adverse effects on our operations in Colorado and the value of our DJ Basin assets and development activities. Certain interest groups in Colorado opposed to crude oil and natural gas development generally, and hydraulic fracturing in particular, have advanced various ballot initiatives designed to significantly limit or prevent crude oil and natural gas development. The State of Colorado approved for signature gathering four ballot measures which would adversely impact our Colorado operations. A measure that would grant local communities certain additional rights to self-governance, including ability to ban certain businesses from operating in their jurisdictions has been withdrawn. Other measures would establish a constitutional right to a healthy environment and obligate local governments to protect the environment, grant local governments control over crude oil and natural gas development and require that all new crude oil and natural gas facilities be located 2,500 feet from occupied structures and an expansive list of landscape features called "areas of special concern." All of these measures are available for signature gathering and the proponents have until August 8, 2016 to gather the requisite number of signatures to qualify for the November 2016 ballot. If any initiative or legislation of this nature is implemented and survives legal challenge, significant additional limitations or prohibitions could be placed on crude oil and natural gas production and development within certain areas of Colorado or the state as a whole. This could adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of development activities in Colorado, particularly those involving hydraulic fracturing, and significantly and adversely affect the value of our assets, impede our growth and trigger a substantial impairment of these assets.Item 2.
