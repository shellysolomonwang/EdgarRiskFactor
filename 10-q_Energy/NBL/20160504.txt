Item 1A. Risk Factors.Producing Properties In 2016, commodity prices, including WTI, Brent and HH, have continued to trade in a low range and remain volatile. A further decline in future crude oil, natural gas or NGL prices could result in some of our properties becoming uneconomic, resulting in additional impairment charges, decrease in proved reserves and/or shut-in of currently producing wells.In addition, in certain onshore US areas, transportation bottlenecks caused by oversupply and/or lack of infrastructure can reduce the amount of production reaching premium markets, resulting in less favorable basis differentials, or differences between WTI and HH pricing and the average prices we actually receive. A widening of these basis differentials could also reduce cash flows and result in property impairment charges.30Table of Contents   The cash flow model that we use to assess proved properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as management’s estimates of future crude oil and natural gas production along with operating and development costs, market outlook on forward commodity prices, and interest rates. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date of estimate. However, a decrease in forward commodity prices, or widening of basis differentials, alone could result in an impairment.In addition, well decommissioning programs, especially in deepwater or remote locations, are often complex and expensive. It may be difficult to estimate timing of actual abandonment activities, which are subject to regulatory approval and the availability of rigs and services. It may be difficult to estimate costs as rigs and services become more expensive in periods of higher demand. Therefore, our ARO estimates may change, sometimes significantly, and could result in asset impairment. Divestments We are currently marketing certain non-core onshore US properties. If properties are reclassified as assets held for sale in the future, they will be valued at the lower of net book value or anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell. Impairment expense would be recorded for any excess of net book value over anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell.31Table of Contents   RESULTS OF OPERATIONSRevenuesRevenues were as follows:     (Decrease) / Increase from Prior Year(millions)2016 2015 Three Months Ended March 31,     Oil, Gas and NGL Sales$705 $749 (6)%Income from Equity Method Investees19 18 6 %Total$724 $767 (6)%Changes in revenues are discussed below.Oil, Gas and NGL Sales We generally sell crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs under two types of agreements common in our industry. Both types of agreements may include transportation charges. One type of agreement is a netback agreement, under which we sell crude oil and natural gas at the wellhead and receive a price, net of transportation expense incurred by the purchaser. In the case of NGLs, we may receive a price from the purchaser, which is net of fractionation and processing costs. Historically, we have recorded revenue at the net price we had received from the purchaser, net of transportation, fractionation or processing costs. Beginning in 2016, we changed our presentation of revenue to no longer include expenses netted from revenue by the purchaser. Crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales are now shown without deductions relating to transportation, fractionation or processing costs, which are now recorded as production expense. Prior year amounts, including revenues, expenses, average realized sales prices and average production costs per BOE, have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Amounts reclassified in first quarter 2015 totaled $9 million relating to NGL sales; respective crude oil and natural gas sales amounts were de minimis. In addition, commodity prices we receive may be reduced by location basis differentials, which can be significant. As a result of location basis differentials, our reported sales prices may differ significantly from published commodity price benchmarks for the same period.Average daily sales volumes and average realized sales prices were as follows: Sales Volumes Average Realized Sales Prices Crude Oil & Condensate(MBbl/d) NaturalGas(MMcf/d) NGLs(MBbl/d) Total(MBoe/d) (1) Crude Oil & Condensate(Per Bbl) NaturalGas(Per Mcf) NGLs(Per Bbl)Three Months Ended March 31, 2016United States102 910 53 306 $30.14 $1.90 $11.18Equatorial Guinea (2)27 195 — 60 34.49 0.27 —Israel— 266 — 45 — 5.19 —Total Consolidated Operations129 1,371 53 411 31.04 2.30 11.18Equity Investees (3)1 — 4 5 33.30 — 22.19Total130 1,371 57 416 $31.06 $2.30 $12.01Three Months Ended March 31, 2015United States73 619 25 201 $44.39 $2.72 $18.80Equatorial Guinea (2)30 231 — 68 49.65 0.27 —Israel— 242 — 40 — 5.45 —Other International (4)1 — — 1 52.89 — —Total Consolidated Operations104 1,092 25 310 45.96 2.81 18.80Equity Investees (3)2 — 6 8 48.63 — 30.17Total106 1,092 31 318 $46.01 $2.81 $20.9932Table of Contents   (1) Natural gas is converted on the basis of six Mcf of gas per one barrel of crude oil equivalent. This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given commodity price disparities, the price for a barrel of crude oil equivalent for US natural gas and NGLs are significantly less than the price for a barrel of crude oil. In Israel, we sell natural gas under contracts where the majority of the price is fixed, resulting in less commodity price disparity.(2) Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant, an LNG plant and a power generation plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned in part by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.(3) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the LPG plant in Equatorial Guinea. See Income from Equity Method Investees, below.(4) Other International includes de minimis North Sea sales volumes with last production in May 2015.An analysis of revenues from sales of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs is as follows: Sales Revenues(millions)Crude Oil & Condensate NaturalGas NGLs TotalThree Months Ended March 31, 2015$431 $276 $42 $749Changes due to       Increase in Sales Volumes110 75 48 233Decrease in Sales Prices(176) (64) (37) (277)Three Months Ended March 31, 2016$365 $287 $53 $705Crude Oil and Condensate Sales – Revenues from crude oil and condensate sales decreased during first quarter 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the following:•decreases in average realized prices primarily due to the decline in global commodity prices that began in the second half of 2014;partially offset by:•higher sales volumes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to production from the Big Bend and Dantzler development projects, which began producing in fourth quarter 2015, with each project contributing 8 MBbl/d, net, in first quarter 2016; and •sales volumes contributed by our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets acquired in third quarter 2015, which contributed 10 MBbl/d and 7 MBbl/d, net, respectively, in first quarter 2016.Natural Gas Sales – Revenues from natural gas sales increased during first quarter 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the following:•higher sales volumes in the Marcellus Shale due to commencing production on eight operated wells, our joint venture partner commencing production on 17 wells, and the recognition of efficiencies in base production performance; and •sales volumes contributed by our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets acquired in third quarter 2015, which contributed 121 MMcf/d and 9 MMcf/d, net, respectively, in first quarter 2016;partially offset by:•decreases in average realized prices primarily due to the decline in global commodity prices that began in the second half of 2014; and•a widening of location basis differentials in the Marcellus Shale due to an oversupply of natural gas in the region.NGL Sales – Revenues from NGL sales increased during first quarter 2016 as compared with 2015 due to the following:•higher sales volumes in the Marcellus Shale due to commencing production on eight operated wells, our joint venture partner commencing production on 17 wells, and the recognition of efficiencies in base production performance;•higher sales volumes in the DJ Basin due to increased activity in East Pony and Wells Ranch; and•sales volumes contributed by our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets acquired in third quarter 2015, which contributed 20 MBbl/d and 2 MBbl/d, net, respectively, in first quarter 2016;partially offset by:•decreases in average realized prices primarily driven by oversupply.Income from Equity Method Investees  We have interests in equity method investees that operate midstream assets onshore US and West Africa. Equity method investments are included in other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets, and our share of earnings is reported as income from equity method investees in our consolidated statements of operations. Within our consolidated statements of cash flows, activity is reflected within cash flows provided by operating activities and cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities. 33Table of Contents   Income from equity method investees increased $1 million during the first three months of 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase primarily includes a $6 million increase from AMPCO, our methanol investee, which experienced a 45-day plant turnaround during first quarter 2015; an $11 million decrease from Alba Plant, our LPG investee, due to lower sales volumes and lower realized prices; an increase of $4 million from our investments in CONE Gathering LLC and CONE Midstream Partners due primarily to higher throughput volumes; and an increase of $2 million from other investments.Operating Costs and ExpensesOperating costs and expenses were as follows:     Increase / (Decrease)from Prior Year(millions)2016 2015 Three Months Ended March 31,     Production Expense$272 $254 7 %Exploration Expense163 65 151 %Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization617 454 36 %General and Administrative91 94 (3)%Other Operating Expense, Net3 34 (91)%Total$1,146 $901 27 %Changes in operating costs and expenses are discussed below.Production Expense Components of production expense were as follows:(millions, except unit rate)Total per BOE (1) Total UnitedStates Equatorial Guinea Israel Corporate Three Months Ended March 31, 2016           Lease Operating Expense (2)$4.31 $161 $120 $29 $10 $2Production and Ad Valorem Taxes0.11 4 4 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense  (3)2.86 107 107 — — —Total Production Expense$7.28 $272 $231 $29 $10 $2Total Production Expense per BOE  $7.28 $8.29 $5.34 $2.46 N/MThree Months Ended March 31, 2015           Lease Operating Expense (2)$5.61 $157 $103 $34 $12 $8Production and Ad Valorem Taxes1.16 32 32 — — —Transportation and Gathering Expense (3)2.32 65 65 — — —Total Production Expense$9.09 $254 $200 $34 $12 $8Total Production Expense per BOE  $9.09 $11.05 $5.55 $3.27 N/MN/M amount is not meaningful. (1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.(2) Lease operating expense includes oil and gas operating costs (labor, fuel, repairs, replacements, saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs) and workover expense.(3) Certain of our revenue received from purchasers was historically presented with deduction for transportation, fractionation or processing costs. Beginning in 2016, we have changed our presentation of revenue to no longer include these expenses as deductions from revenue. These costs are now included within production expense and prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.For first quarter of 2016, total production expense increased as compared with 2015 due to the following: •an increase onshore US lease operating, transportation and gathering expense due to higher onshore US production, including the addition of production from our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets in third quarter 2015; partially offset by: •a decrease in lease operating expense due to continued focus on cost reduction and efficiency initiatives;•a decrease in production and ad valorem taxes due to the accrual of a $28 million onshore US severance tax receivable recorded in first quarter 2016; and•a decrease in production and ad valorem taxes due to lower revenues resulting from the decline in commodity prices in the US.34Table of Contents   The unit rate per BOE for total production expense decreased for 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to an increase in production of nearly 100 MBoe/d, net, lower production and ad valorem taxes as a result of the pricing environment as well as the impact of cost reduction initiatives in lease operating expense. The decrease in unit rate per BOE was partially offset by the increase in transportation and gathering expense primarily due to the addition of our Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin assets in third quarter 2015 and an increase in production in the Marcellus Shale.

Exploration expense for first quarter 2016 included:•US dry hole cost represents the Silvergate exploratory well, deepwater Gulf of Mexico; •US Other cost includes lease rentals of $12 million primarily related to Permian Basin leases; and•salaries and related expenses for corporate exploration and new ventures personnel.Exploration expense for first quarter 2015 included the following:•$13 million of dry hole cost related primarily to onshore US exploratory wells; and•salaries and related expenses for corporate exploration and new ventures personnel. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD&A expense was as follows: Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2016 2015DD&A Expense (millions) (1)$617 $454Unit Rate per BOE (2)$16.52 $16.24(1) For DD&A expense by geographical area, see Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 12. Segment Information.(2) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.35Table of Contents   Total DD&A expense for first quarter 2016 increased as compared with 2015 due to the following:•the addition of Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin production in third quarter 2015, resulting in $40 million and $11 million in DD&A expense respectively, in first quarter 2016;•an increase in the Marcellus Shale, Eastern Mediterranean and deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to higher sales volumes;•a reduction in proved reserves in fourth quarter 2015 primarily due to downward price revisions in DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale; partially offset by:•a decrease in sales volumes offshore Equatorial Guinea due to downtime installing the B3 compression platform and scheduled maintenance in the Alba field; and •the impact of lower net book value as a result of a fourth quarter 2015 impairment offshore Equatorial Guinea properties.The increase in the unit rate per BOE for the first quarter 2016 as compared with 2015 was due primarily to higher-cost production volumes in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, reductions in proved reserves in fourth quarter 2015 due to downward price revisions, offset by increased lower-cost production volumes from the Tamar field.Significant changes to the proved reserves at December 31, 2015 include; additions of 269 MMBoe resulting from the Rosetta Merger during the third quarter 2015 offset by downward revisions of 307 MMBoe that were commodity price driven. Estimates of proved reserves significantly affect our DD&A expense. Holding other factors constant, a decline in proved reserves estimates caused by decreases in the 12-month average commodity prices, will result in an increase in DD&A expense in future periods, which would reduce earnings. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows: Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2016 2015G&A Expense (millions)$91 $94Unit Rate per BOE (1)$2.44 $3.36(1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.G&A expense for first quarter of 2016 decreased as compared with 2015 primarily due to cost savings initiatives, including reduced use of contractors and consultants and decreased special projects and other discretionary expenses, and decreases in employee personnel costs, partially offset by the addition of Rosetta employees in the third quarter of 2015.

Many factors impact a gain or loss on commodity derivative instruments including: increases and decreases in the commodity forward price curves compared to the terms of our executed commodity instruments; increases in notional volumes; and the mix of instruments between NYMEX WTI, Dated Brent and NYMEX Henry Hub commodities.  See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Note 7.

The decrease in capitalized interest for first quarter 2016 as compared with 2015 is primarily due to lower work in progress amounts related to major long-term projects in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, offshore Cyprus, onshore US, and offshore Falkland Islands.

Income Taxes for a discussion of the change in our effective tax rate for first quarter 2016 as compared with 2015.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCapital Structure/Financing StrategyIn seeking to effectively fund and monetize our discovered hydrocarbons, we employ a capital structure and financing strategy designed to provide sufficient liquidity throughout the volatile commodity price cycle, including the current commodity price environment. Specifically, we strive to retain the ability to fund long cycle, multi-year, capital intensive development projects throughout a range of scenarios, while also funding a continuing exploration program and maintaining capacity to capitalize on financially attractive periodic mergers and acquisitions activity. We endeavor to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade debt rating in service of these objectives. We utilize a commodity price hedging program to reduce the impacts of commodity price volatility and enhance the predictability of cash flows along with a risk and insurance program to protect against disruption to our cash flows and the funding of our business.We strive to maintain a minimum liquidity level to address volatility and risk. Traditional sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash on hand, available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility, and proceeds from sales of non-core properties. 37Table of Contents   We occasionally access the capital markets to ensure adequate liquidity exists in the form of unutilized capacity under our Revolving Credit Facility or to refinance scheduled debt maturities. On January 6, 2016, we entered into the Term Loan Facility which provides for a three-year term loan facility for a principal amount of $1.4 billion. In connection with the Term Loan Facility, we launched cash tender offers for certain Senior Notes assumed in the Rosetta Merger. The borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used solely to fund the tender offers. Collectively, the result of these transactions provides for significant future interest expense savings with a shorter term debt maturity. While we have no near-term debt maturities, we may seek to access the capital markets to refinance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness. As of March 31, 2016, we had $7.5 billion of long-term debt outstanding, $2.4 billion of which is due first quarter 2019. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt.In addition, we evaluate potential strategic farm-out arrangements of our working interests for reimbursement of our capital spending and may consider non-core asset sales or other sources of funding. During first quarter 2016, we received cash proceeds of over $190 million from our Cyprus farm-out and the sale of our Karish and Tanin discoveries offshore Israel and divested of certain non-core onshore US assets.Cash on hand at March 31, 2016 totaled approximately $1.0 billion, which includes both domestic and foreign cash, and there were no amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility, below. Our nearly 60% reduction in capital spending in first quarter 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015, coupled with operating efficiencies to increase production at lower costs, has significantly strengthened our position to align capital spending with our operating cash flows. We will continue our effort to invest capital at a level aligned with current operating cash flows. Our financial capacity and lack of near-term debt maturities, coupled with our diversified global portfolio, provides us with flexibility in our investment decisions including execution of our major development projects and exploration activity. To support our investment program, we expect that production resulting from our core onshore US development programs, combined with new production from the Big Bend and Dantzler development projects, which began producing in fourth quarter 2015, and from the Gunflint development, which is expected to begin producing in 2016, as well as increased peak deliverability resulting from the Tamar compression project, and presuming no significant further deterioration of prices, will result in an increase in cash flows which will be available to meet a portion of future capital commitments in 2016 and subsequent years. See Results of Operations above.We are currently evaluating potential development and/or financing scenarios for our significant natural gas discoveries offshore Eastern Mediterranean. The magnitude of these discoveries presents technical and financial challenges for us due to the large-scale development requirements. Each of these development options, including the development of Leviathan Phase 1, would require a multi-billion dollar investment and require a number of years to complete. We are currently working with the Government of Israel to resolve stability measures to enable Leviathan and other development to move forward. See Update on Israel Natural Gas Regulatory Framework, above.Available Liquidity Information regarding cash and debt balances is as follows: March 31, December 31,(millions, except percentages)2016 2015Cash and Cash Equivalents$953 $1,028Amount Available to be Borrowed Under Revolving Credit Facility (1)4,000 4,000Total Liquidity$4,953 $5,028Total Debt (2)$7,979 $7,976Total Shareholders' Equity10,052 10,370Ratio of Debt-to-Book Capital (3)44% 43%(1) See Revolving Credit Facility, below.(2) Total debt includes capital lease obligations and excludes unamortized debt discount/premium.(3) We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes long-term debt excluding unamortized discount, the current portion of long-term debt, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.Cash and Cash Equivalents We had approximately $1.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2016, primarily denominated in US dollars and invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. Approximately $435 million of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries. We have recorded a related deferred tax liability on undistributed foreign earnings for the future additional US tax liability for the US and foreign tax rate differences, net of estimated foreign tax credit.Revolving Credit Facility  Our Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 27, 2020. The commitment is $4.0 billion through the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the 38Table of Contents   Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility subject us to interest rate risk. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Commodity Derivative Instruments  We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs. Such instruments may include variable to fixed price commodity swaps, two-way collars, three-way collars, swaptions and enhanced swaps.Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. We net settle by counterparty based on netting provisions within the master agreements. None of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements. Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of March 31, 2016, the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $460 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $3 million (after consideration of netting provisions within our master agreements). See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 7. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of commodity derivative instruments, and Credit Risk, below.Credit Risk We monitor the creditworthiness of our trade creditors, joint venture partners, hedge counterparties, and financial institutions on an ongoing basis. Counterparty credit downgrades or liquidity problems could result in a delay in our receiving proceeds from commodity sales, reimbursement of joint venture costs, and potential delays in our major development projects. As operator of the joint ventures, we pay joint venture expenses and make cash calls on our nonoperating partners for their respective shares of joint venture costs. Our projects are capital cost intensive and, in some cases, a nonoperating partner may experience a delay in obtaining financing for its share of the joint venture costs or have liquidity problems resulting in slow payment of joint venture costs. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of a joint venture partner, we may be required to complete their share of remediation activities or fulfill their lease obligations which could result in significant financial losses.We are unable to predict sudden changes in a party's creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict such sudden changes, our ability to negate these risks may be limited and we could incur significant financial losses.Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the form of parental guarantees, letters of credit or credit insurance; however, not all of our counterparty credit is protected through guarantees or credit support. In addition, we maintain credit insurance associated with specific purchasers. However, nonperformance by a trade creditor, joint venture partner, hedge counterparty or financial institution could result in significant financial losses.Contractual Obligations Marcellus Shale Joint Development Agreement  The joint development agreement for our jointly owned Marcellus Shale acreage provides for a multi-year drilling and development plan (default plan). We and CONSOL have agreed to an annual plan that provides for fewer wells to be drilled than the number of wells that was provided for in the default plan, and, for 2016, the amount of capital investment allocated to the Marcellus Shale core area will be less than the amount provided for in the default plan. Each of us has a non-consent right, which is the right to elect not to participate in all (but not less than all) of the operations provided for the following year. If one of us elects to exercise the non-consent right, then the other partner, in its sole discretion, may determine the number of wells, if any, it will drill in such year, which may be significantly less than the number of wells that was provided for in the default plan, or none at all. In the event we elect to exercise our non-consent right for a given year, we would still have to pay the carried costs that are contemplated by the development plan for that non-consent year. Under the joint development agreement, this non-consent right may be exercised by each partner twice (in non-consecutive years) prior to the termination of the default plan at the end of 2020. Neither of us has exercised the non-consent right, and thus, each of us may still elect to exercise the non-consent right twice prior to the end of 2020.CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation See Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies.Exploration Commitments The terms of some of our production sharing contracts, licenses or concession agreements may require us to conduct certain exploration activities, including drilling one or more exploratory wells or acquiring seismic data, within specific time periods. These obligations can extend over periods of several years, and failure to conduct such exploration activities within the prescribed periods could lead to loss of leases or exploration rights. Our exploration commitments currently include a 3D seismic obligation offshore Gabon.Continuous Development Obligations Although the majority of our assets are held by production, certain of our onshore US assets are held through continuous development obligations. Therefore, we are contractually obligated to fund a level of development activity in these areas and failure to meet these obligations may result in the loss of a lease.Delivery and Firm Transportation Agreements We have entered into various long-term gathering, processing, transportation and delivery contracts for some of our onshore US natural gas production. These contracts may commit us to deliver minimum 39Table of Contents   volumes and require us to make payments for any shortfalls in delivering or transporting the minimum volumes under the commitments. We may use long-term contracts such as these to provide flow assurance for production in over-supplied markets with limited infrastructure, such as the Marcellus Shale, to enable our production to reach higher priced out-of-basin markets.Although we strive to schedule well completion activities to meet the minimum volumes under the commitments, we may experience temporary delivery or transportation shortfalls. During first quarter 2016, we incurred expense of approximately $16 million related to deficiencies and/or unutilized commitments. We expect to continue to incur deficiency and/or unutilized costs in the near-term as development activities continue. For full year 2016, we estimate these costs could range from approximately $40 million to $50 million. Should commodity prices continue to decline or we are unable to continue to develop our properties as planned, or certain wells become uneconomic and are shut-in, we could incur additional shortfalls in delivering or transporting the minimum volumes and we could be required to make payments in the event that these commitments are not otherwise offset. Although long-term shortfalls are unknown, we continually seek to optimize any short-term under-utilized assets through capacity release and third-party arrangements as well as by shifting transportation of production from rail cars to pipelines where we receive a higher netback price. Credit Rating Events   We do not have any triggering events on our corporate debt that would cause a default in case of a downgrade of our credit rating. In addition, there are no existing ratings triggers in any of our commodity hedging agreements that would require the posting of collateral. However, a series of downgrades or other negative rating actions could increase our cost of financing, and may increase our requirements to post collateral as financial assurance of performance under certain other contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts, crude oil and natural gas sales contracts, work commitments and certain abandonment obligations. A requirement to post collateral could have a negative impact on our liquidity.Cash FlowsCash flow information is as follows: Three Months EndedMarch 31, (millions)2016 2015Total Cash Provided By (Used in)   Operating Activities$251 $541Investing Activities(264) (1,036)Financing Activities(62) 1,021Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents$(75) $526Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the first three months of 2016 decreased significantly as compared with 2015. Decreases in average realized commodity prices were partially offset by increases in sales volumes and more favorable settlements of commodity derivatives. Working capital changes contributed $136 million of negative operating cash flow in the first three months of 2016 as compared with a positive impact of $18 million in the first three months of 2015.Investing Activities Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method. These investing activities may be offset by proceeds from property sales or dispositions, including farm-out arrangements, which may result in reimbursement for capital spending that had occurred in prior periods. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment decreased by $615 million during the first three months of 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to a reduced capital spending program. Investing activities included $6 million in CONE Gathering LLC during the first three months of 2016 as compared with $44 million in the first three months of 2015. We received $238 million in proceeds from asset divestitures during the first three months of 2016, as compared with $119 million during the same period in 2015. Financing Activities  Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first three months of 2016, funds were provided by cash proceeds from the term loan acquisition ($1.4 billion). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($41 million), fund the purchase of certain of our outstanding senior notes ($1.38 billion), and make principal payments related to capital lease obligations ($13 million).In comparison, during the first three months of 2015, funds were provided by cash proceeds from the issuance of shares of Company common stock to the public ($1.1 billion). We used cash to pay dividends on our common stock ($64 million) and make principal payments related to capital lease obligations ($19 million).See Item 1.

See Operating Outlook – 2016 Capital Investment Program, above. Financing ActivitiesLong-Term Debt Our principal source of liquidity is our Revolving Credit Facility that matures August 27, 2020. At March 31, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $4.0 billion available for use. We may rely on our Revolving Credit Facility to help fund our capital investment program, and may periodically borrow amounts for working capital purposes. On January 6, 2016, we entered into the Term Loan Facility with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., as syndication agent, and certain other financial institutions party thereto, which provides for a three-year term loan facility for a principal amount of $1.4 billion. In connection with the Term Loan Facility, we launched cash tender offers for certain Senior Notes assumed in the Rosetta Merger. The borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used solely to fund the tender offers. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 6. Debt.Our outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding capital lease obligations) totaled approximately $6.1 billion at March 31, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 5.69%, with maturities ranging from March 2019 to August 2097.Dividends During first quarter 2016, our Board of Directors adjusted the quarterly dividend to align the dividend yield with historical levels and to further enhance our liquidity. We paid total cash dividends of 10 cents per share of common stock during first quarter 2016 as compared with 18 cents per share during first quarter 2015.On April 25, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 10 cents per common share, which will be paid on May 23, 2016 to shareholders of record on May 9, 2016. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.Exercise of Stock Options We received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $5 million during the first three months of 2016 and $4 million during the first three months of 2015.Common Stock Repurchases We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 228,917 shares with a value of $8 million during the first three months of 2016 and 249,122 shares with a value of $12 million during the first three months of 2015. 41Table of Contents   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskCommodity Price RiskDerivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.At March 31, 2016, we had various open commodity derivative instruments related to crude oil and natural gas. Changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of $457 million. Based on the March 31, 2016 published commodity futures price curves for the underlying commodities, a hypothetical price increase of $10.00 per Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by approximately $154 million. A hypothetical price increase of $0.50 per MMBtu for natural gas would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by approximately $19 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.Interest Rate RiskChanges in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.At March 31, 2016, we had approximately $7.5 billion (excluding capital lease obligations) of long-term debt, net, outstanding. Of this amount, $6.1 billion was fixed-rate debt, net, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.69%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to interest rate risk or cash flow loss.However, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances. As of March 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents totaled nearly $1.0 billion, approximately 30% of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. In addition, borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to variable interest rates which expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to potential increases in market interest rates. A change in the interest rate applicable to our variable-rate debt could expose us to additional interest cost. While we currently have no interest rate derivative instruments as of March 31, 2016, we may invest in such instruments in the future in order to mitigate interest rate risk. A change in the interest rate applicable to our short-term investments would have a de minimis impact. Foreign Currency RiskThe US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as taxes payable in foreign tax jurisdictions, are settled in the foreign local currency. A reduction in the value of the US dollar against currencies of other countries in which we have material operations could result in the use of additional cash to settle operating, administrative, and tax liabilities. Net transaction gains and losses were de minimis for first quarter of each of 2016 and 2015.We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determine that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
