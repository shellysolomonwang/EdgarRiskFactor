Item 1A. Risk Factors), significant decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices could result in a reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. The commodity price decreases that began during the second half of 2008 required us to record asset impairment charges during fourth quarter 2008. Further declines in natural gas prices during first quarter 2009 led us to review those properties that, at year-end 2008, were susceptible to impairment should commodity prices continue to decline appreciably. As a result of this review, we determined that additional properties were impaired as of March 31, 2009. Total pre-tax (non-cash) impairments for first quarter 2009 were $437 million and were predominately related to Granite Wash, an onshore US area in which we have significantly reduced investments beginning in 2007. The decrease in the natural gas futures price strip that occurred during first quarter 2009 was the primary factor that required an impairment of Granite Wash. There were no asset impairments during the second or third quarters of 2009. However, further declines in commodity prices could result in additional impairment of our oil and gas properties, other long-lived assets or goodwill. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.   During the second and third quarters of 2009, our operations benefited from the strengthening crude oil market, but sustained lower commodity prices will continue to reduce our cash flows from operations as compared to prior years. To mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices on our cash flows, we entered into crude oil and natural gas commodity contracts for 2009, 2010 and 2011. Depending on the length of the current recession, commodity prices may stay depressed or decline further, thereby causing a prolonged downturn, which would further reduce our cash flows from operations. This could cause us to alter our business plans including reducing or delaying our exploration and development program spending and other cost reduction initiatives. See 2009 Budget below.   We are closely monitoring costs and have implemented several cost savings initiatives, including continued reduction of well costs through drilling and completion efficiencies and comprehensive review of oil and gas operating costs. We are also continuing to see reductions in third party drilling costs and operating supplies and services.  OUTLOOK   Our expected crude oil, natural gas and NGL production for the remainder of 2009 may be impacted by several factors including:           ·   overall level and timing of capital expenditures, as discussed below, which, dependent upon our drilling success, are expected to maintain our near-term production volumes;            ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-continent areas of our US operations;            ·   downtime beginning in mid-August at the Dumbarton field in the UK sector of the North Sea due to FPSO repairs with an expected return to operation by the end of October;            ·   variations in sales volumes of natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea related to potential downtime at the methanol, LPG and/or LNG plants;            ·   potential hurricane-related volume curtailments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast areas as occurred with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008;            27      Table of Contents             ·   potential winter storm-related volume curtailments in the Northern region of our US operations;            ·   potential pipeline and processing facility capacity constraints in the Rocky Mountains area of our US operations;            ·   Israeli demand for electricity which affects demand for natural gas as fuel for power generation, market growth and competing deliveries of natural gas from Egypt;            ·   seasonal variations in rainfall in Ecuador that affect our natural gas-to-power project; and            ·   timing of significant project completion and initial production.       2009 Budget – Due to the uncertain economic and commodity price environment, we designed a flexible capital spending program that has been responsive to conditions that developed during 2009. Our revised capital program for 2009 targets an investment level of approximately $1.4 billion.    Approximately 40% of the 2009 budget is committed to longer-term projects that will provide considerable production growth several years in the future. The remainder is allocated toward maintaining and strengthening the existing property base. Development spending is focused on our international and deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets as well as certain higher return opportunities onshore in the US including the Wattenberg field. The exploration budget is centered on significant resource potential in Israel, West Africa and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. International expenditures are estimated to represent 30% of the total capital program.   The 2009 budget does not include the impact of possible asset purchases. We expect that the remaining 2009 budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.   Potential Sale of Noble Energy Europe – We maintain an ongoing portfolio optimization program which may result in the divestiture of non-core assets in order to maintain a balanced portfolio of high-quality, core properties. We are marketing our wholly-owned European subsidiary Noble Energy (Europe) Limited (Noble Energy Europe). Noble Energy Europe holds non-operated interests in four UK Central North Sea producing oil fields, four UK Southern Gas Basin fields and an oil/gas field offshore Netherlands. Additionally, Noble Energy Europe has interests in a number of North Sea exploration and development projects and minor onshore UK fields. We are currently soliciting bids, but the board of directors and management have not committed to a plan to sell the asset.   Change in Insurance Coverage – We are a member in Oil Insurance Limited (OIL). OIL is a mutual insurance company which insures property, pollution liability, control of well and other catastrophic risks. In September 2009, OIL members approved a proposal that will eliminate 40% of the current per occurrence windstorm coverage provided by OIL to members, effective January 1, 2010. As of that date, windstorm coverage will be provided on a 60% quota share basis. As a result, our maximum recovery from OIL for any one windstorm loss, excess of a $10 million deductible, has been reduced from $250 million to $150 million. As a result of our recent asset retirement efforts at Main Pass, our risk of windstorm damage has been reduced. We have not yet determined whether we will seek additional third party insurance to replace the reduction in OIL coverage.   Recently Issued Pronouncements – See Item 1.

Revenues from crude oil and condensate sales decreased during the first nine months of 2009 as compared with the first nine months of 2008 due to the following:           ·   a 35% decline in total consolidated average realized prices;            ·   impact of shut-ins related to Hurricane Ike in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico;            ·   downtime beginning in mid-August at the Dumbarton field in the UK sector of the North Sea due to FPSO repairs; and            ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast area;              offset by              ·   increased Wattenberg field production due to ongoing development activity.      Revenues from crude oil and condensate sales included deferred losses of $14 million and $89 million for third quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $45 million and $279 million for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively, reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges.   Natural Gas Sales – Revenues from natural gas sales decreased during the third quarter of 2009 as compared with the third quarter of 2008 due to the following:           ·   a 55% decline in total consolidated average realized prices; and            ·   natural field decline in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast and Mid-continent areas;              offset by              ·   increased production from the Wattenberg, Piceance and Shattuck (Western Oklahoma) areas of our US operations;            32      Table of Contents             ·   return of Ticonderoga in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to full production; and            ·   sales of natural gas from the Raton development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico which began year-end 2008.      Revenues from natural gas sales decreased during the first nine months of 2009 as compared with the first nine months of 2008 due to the following:           ·   a 56% decline in total consolidated average realized prices;            ·   shut-ins related to Hurricane Ike in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and            ·   decreased Israel natural gas sales due to power plant downtime and competing natural gas sales from Egypt;              offset by              ·   increased production from the Wattenberg, Piceance and Shattuck areas;            ·   sales of natural gas from the Raton development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico which began year-end 2008; and            ·   increase in Equatorial Guinea volumes sold to the LNG plant due to less maintenance downtime at the LNG plant.      Revenues from natural gas sales included a deferred loss of $4 million for third quarter 2008 and a deferred gain of $31 million for the first nine months of 2008 reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges. Revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 included a de minimis amount reclassified from AOCL and related to commodity derivative instruments previously accounted for as cash flow hedges.   NGL Sales – Most of our US NGL production is from the Wattenberg field and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. NGL sales decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 as compared with 2008 due to the significant decrease in average realized NGL prices.    Equity Method Investees   Our share of operations of equity method investees, Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC (AMPCO) and Alba Plant LLC (Alba Plant), was as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008      Net Income (in millions):                            AMPCO and Affiliates    $ 6     $ 5     $ 9     $ 51     Alba Plant      19       35       43       107     Dividends (in millions):                                    AMPCO and Affiliates      6       16       6       54     Alba Plant      26       55       31       138     Sales Volumes:                                    Methanol (MMgal)      41       23       109       93     Condensate (MBopd)      2       2       2       2     LPG (MBpd)      6       5       6       6     Production Volumes:                                    Methanol (MMgal)      35       21       111       83     Condensate (MBopd)      2       2       2       2     LPG (MBpd)      6       6       6       6     Average Realized Prices:                                    Methanol (per gallon)    $ 0.64     $ 1.16     $ 0.52     $ 1.33     Condensate (per Bbl)      66.33       116.04       56.42       110.43     LPG (per Bbl)      38.26       67.56       31.65       66.08        The decrease in net income for each of the equity method investees for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 as compared with 2008 was due to significant decreases in average realized prices. Methanol sales volumes were higher during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 as compared with 2008 as AMPCO experienced significant downtime for compressor and other equipment maintenance during 2008.         33      Table of Contents     The decreases in dividends for each of the equity method investees during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 were due to reduced year-to-date net income.

(2)   Lease operating expense includes oil and gas operating costs (labor, fuel, repairs, replacements, saltwater disposal and other related lifting costs) and workover expense.      For the third quarter of 2009, total production costs decreased as compared with the third quarter of 2008 due to the following:           ·   decrease in US lease operating expense associated with cost savings initiatives including reduced repair programs and a reduction of other discretionary spending in our onshore US operations including a reduced workover program in the Northern region;            ·   decrease in North Sea lease operating expense due to lower sales volumes, resulting in an increase in crude oil inventory, which includes production cost expense;            ·   decrease in production and ad valorem taxes due to reduced proceeds from sales attributable to lower commodity prices in the US and China and the cessation of production due to the sale of our interest in Argentina; and            ·   decrease in North Sea transportation expense due to decrease in production;            34      Table of Contents             offset by              ·   increase in West Africa lease operating expense due to higher contractor costs; and            ·   increase in US transportation expense due to start up of a new interstate crude oil transportation pipeline system used to market our Wattenberg production.      For the first nine months of 2009, total production costs decreased as compared with the first nine months of 2008 due to the following:           ·   decrease in North Sea lease operating expense due to an increase in crude oil inventory;            ·   decrease in US lease operating expense due to a reduced workover program in the Northern region;            ·   decrease in production and ad valorem taxes due to reduced proceeds from sales attributable to lower commodity prices in the US and China and the cessation of production due to the sale of our interest in Argentina; and            ·   decrease in North Sea transportation expense due to decrease in production;              offset by              ·   increase in US lease operating expense due to an increase in well count, higher salt water disposal costs in the Northern region and higher insurance expense;            ·   increase in West Africa lease operating expense due to higher contractor costs and higher maintenance expense; and            ·   increase in US transportation expense due to start up of a new interstate crude oil transportation pipeline system used to market our Wattenberg production.      Selected expenses on a per BOE basis were as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008      Lease Operating Expense    $ 4.57     $ 5.22     $ 5.07     $ 4.69     Production and Ad Valorem Taxes      1.28       2.50       1.19       2.47     Transportation Expense      0.93       0.76       0.77       0.75     Total Production Costs (1) (2)    $ 6.78     $ 8.48     $ 7.03     $ 7.91            (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $1.10 per BOE and $1.28 per BOE for third quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $1.28 per BOE and $1.23 per BOE for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Oil and gas exploration expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 decreased as compared with the same periods in 2008 primarily due to reductions in dry hole and seismic expenses. There was less dry hole expense in 2009 due to our successful exploration drilling programs. Dry hole expense in 2008 was due primarily to exploration wells in Suriname and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico which did not encounter hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. US seismic expense decreased in 2009 as compared with 2008 due to a reduction in expenditures made for seismic data in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.   Exploration expense also includes stock-based compensation expense of $2 million and $1 million for third quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $7 million and $2 million for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.         36      Table of Contents     Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization DD&A expense was as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,     Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008          (in millions, except unit rate)      DD&A Expense    $ 201     $ 191     $ 590     $ 586     Accretion of Discount on Asset Retirement Obligations      4       3       11       7     Total DD&A Expense    $ 205     $ 194     $ 601     $ 593     Unit Rate per BOE (1)    $ 10.68     $ 10.38     $ 10.86     $ 10.37            (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $1.44 per BOE and $1.25 per BOE for third quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $1.64 and $1.31 per BOE for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.      Total DD&A expense for the third quarter of 2009 increased as compared with the third quarter of 2008 due to the following:           ·   higher production in the Wattenberg, Piceance and Shattuck areas;            ·   ongoing capital spending in the Northern region; and            ·   negative reserve revisions related to lower year-end 2008 commodity prices;              Offset by lower sales volumes in the North Sea.      Total DD&A expense for the first nine months of 2009 increased as compared with the first nine months of 2008 due to the following:           ·   higher production in the Wattenberg, Piceance and Shattuck areas;            ·   ongoing capital spending in the Northern region;            ·   negative reserve revisions related to lower year-end 2008 commodity prices; and            ·   inclusion of $4 million of abandoned asset expense in 2009.              Offset by lower sales volumes in the North Sea and Israel.      The unit rate per BOE increased for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 as compared with the same periods in 2008 due to the change in mix of production, including a decrease in lower-cost volumes from Israel; ongoing capital spending in the Northern region; and negative reserve revisions related to lower year-end 2008 commodity prices.  General and Administrative Expense   General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008      G&A Expense (in millions)    $ 53     $ 63     $ 173     $ 184     Unit Rate per BOE (1)    $ 2.78     $ 3.37     $ 3.11     $ 3.22            (1)   Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees. Sales volumes include natural gas sales to an LNG plant in Equatorial Guinea. The inclusion of these volumes reduced the unit rate by $0.47 per BOE and $0.51 per BOE for third quarter 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $0.57 per BOE and $0.50 per BOE for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.      G&A expense decreased $10 million, or 16%, for the third quarter of 2009 as compared with the third quarter of 2008 and $11 million, or 6%, for the first nine months of 2009 as compared with the first nine months of 2008. The decreases were due to reductions in variable components of incentive compensation.           37      Table of Contents     G&A expense included stock-based compensation expense of $9 million for the third quarters of both 2009 and 2008, and $27 million and $28 million for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008, respectively.   The unit rate per BOE for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 decreased as compared with 2008 due primarily to the reduced G&A expense, as sales volumes on a BOE basis remained about the same period-to-period.    Asset Impairments   Asset impairment expense was as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008          (in millions)      Impairment Expense    $ -     $ 38     $ 437     $ 38        During first quarter 2009 we recorded total pre-tax (non-cash) impairment charges of $437 million on certain US oil and gas properties, primarily due to lower natural gas prices. In determining the fair values of the impaired properties, we applied the principles of fair value measurements as defined by US GAAP. These principles require that fair values be determined from the perspective of a market participant considering, among other things, appropriate discount rates, multiple valuation techniques, the most advantageous market and assumptions around the highest and best use of the assets. Due to the absence of comparable market data for the impaired properties, we estimated the fair values using a discounted cash flow method. Estimated future cash flows were based on management’s expectations for the future and included management’s estimates of future oil and gas production, commodity prices based on published commodity futures price strips as of March 31, 2009, operating and development costs, as well as appropriate discount rates. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, the fair values of the impaired properties were classified as Level 3 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. A change in any of the assumptions used, such as a significant increase or decrease in estimated commodity prices or production, could have had a significant impact on the amount of the impairment loss recognized. There were no asset impairments during the second or third quarters of 2009. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.  Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net   Other operating (income) expense was as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008          (in millions)       Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net    $ 34     $ 60     $ 22     $ 107        Other operating (income) expense, net includes gain on asset sales, electricity generation expense, GMP expense, settlement of legal proceedings, (gain) loss on involuntary conversion, write-down of the SemCrude receivable and other items of operating income or expense. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2 – Basis of Presentation and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies.  (Gain) Loss on Commodity Derivative Instruments   (Gain) loss on commodity derivative instruments was as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008          (in millions)       (Gain) Loss on Commodity Derivative Instruments    $ 28     $ (875 )   $ 95     $ 190                38      Table of Contents     See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.  Interest Expense and Capitalized Interest    Interest expense and capitalized interest were as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008          (in millions)      Interest Expense    $ 35     $ 26     $ 94     $ 75     Capitalized Interest      (12 )     (8 )     (30 )     (23 )   Interest Expense, net    $ 23     $ 18     $ 64     $ 52        Interest expense increased $9 million for third quarter 2009 and $19 million for the first nine months of 2009, as compared with 2008. The increase in interest expense primarily relates to our $1 billion 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019, which we issued on February 27, 2009. This increase was partially offset by a significant decrease in credit facility interest expense due to a decline in both the average outstanding balance and the average interest rate. See also Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities below.   The increases in the amount of interest capitalized are due to higher work in progress related to extended projects in West Africa, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Israel and the higher interest rate associated with our new $1 billion, 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019.    Other Non-operating (Income) Expense, Net   Other non-operating (income) expense was as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008          (in millions)       Other Non-operating (Income) Expense, Net    $ 5     $ (52 )   $ 18     $ (42 )      Other non-operating (income) expense includes deferred compensation (income) expense, interest income and other (income) expense. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 2 – Basis of Presentation.    Income Tax Provision (Benefit)   The income tax provision (benefit) was as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008      Income Tax Provision (Benefit) (in millions)    $ 8     $ 480     $ (210 )   $ 528     Effective Rate      7 %     33 %     60 %     34 %      See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 11 – Income Taxes for a discussion of the change in our effective tax rate during the first nine months of 2009 as compared with 2008.           39      Table of Contents     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   Overview Our primary cash needs are to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures related to the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties, to repay outstanding borrowings and associated interest payments and other contractual commitments and to pay dividends. Traditional sources of our liquidity are cash on hand, cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under credit facilities. Occasional sales of non-strategic crude oil and natural gas properties as well as our periodic access to capital markets may also generate cash.   The ongoing disruption in the credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions. We have reviewed the creditworthiness of the banks and financial institutions with which we maintain our investments as well as the securities underlying our investments. Thus far, our liquidity and financial position have not been materially impacted. However, further deterioration in the credit markets could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. See Executive Overview – Impact of Recession and Current Credit and Commodity Markets.   Cash and Cash Equivalents – We had $926 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2009. Our cash is denominated in US dollars and was invested in US Treasury securities, money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions at September 30, 2009. In response to the credit market crisis, we shortened the duration of our investment maturities and increased our investments in US Treasury securities.   A majority of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries and most would be subject to US income taxes if repatriated. We currently intend to use our international cash to fund international projects, including the development of West Africa and Israel.   During fourth quarter 2008, we performed an analysis of projected short-term working capital needs as well as long-term capital requirements for our US and foreign operations. As a result, we repatriated $180 million of the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries during first quarter 2009. We used the proceeds for debt repayment and general corporate purposes. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 11 – Income Taxes for a discussion of the related income tax effects.   Commodity Derivative Instruments – We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations. Such instruments include variable to fixed commodity price swaps, collars and basis swaps. Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. If actual commodity prices are higher than the fixed or ceiling prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be lower than if we had no derivative instruments. Conversely, if actual commodity prices are lower than the fixed or floor prices in our derivative instruments, our cash flows will be higher than if we had no derivative instruments. Except for certain minor derivative contracts that are entered into from time to time by our marketing subsidiary, none of our counterparty agreements contain margin requirements.   Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of September 30, 2009, the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $96 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $114 million (after consideration of netting agreements). See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for a discussion of counterparty credit risk and Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of commodity derivative instruments.   Contractual Obligations Debt Offering – In February 2009, we completed an underwritten public offering of $1 billion of 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019. See Financing Activities below. As a result, our future debt principal payments as of September 30, 2009 consist of the following: $535 million for 2012; and $1.6 billion for 2014 and beyond for a total of $2.1 billion. Based on the total debt balance, scheduled maturities and interest rates in effect at September 30, 2009, our cash payments for interest would be $20 million for the remainder of 2009; $129 million in 2010; $129 million in 2011; $129 million in 2012; $126 million in 2013; and $1.3 billion for the remaining years for a total of $1.8 billion. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 3 – Debt.   Lease Obligation – On October 6, 2009, we signed an agreement with an unrelated offshore technology provider for the construction and lease of an FPSO to be used for the development of the Aseng field offshore Equatorial Guinea. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 15 – Subsequent Events.           40      Table of Contents     Drilling Contracts – During third quarter 2009, we entered into two drilling rig contracts for our international operations totaling $356 million. Annual payments are expected to be $183 million for 2010 and $173 million for 2011. These amounts represent the gross contract amounts and will be reduced by our non-operating partners’ working interests. These drilling rigs are presently planned to drill wells having an average Noble Energy working interest between approximately 35% to 45%.    Cash Flows Cash flow information is as follows:            Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008          (in millions)      Total Cash Provided By (Used in):                Operating Activities    $ 986     $ 1,867     Investing Activities      (1,012 )     (1,721 )   Financing Activities      (188 )     186     Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents    $ (214 )   $ 332        Operating Activities – Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2009 decreased as compared with the first nine months of 2008 due primarily to decreases in commodity prices.   Investing Activities – Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties, which may be offset by proceeds from property sales. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $709 million during the first nine months of 2009 as compared with the first nine months of 2008. Activity for the first nine months of 2008 included capital spending of $1.9 billion, which was partially offset by net proceeds of $131 million from asset sales. See Investing Activities – Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures below.   Financing Activities – Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first nine months of 2009, we received $989 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 8¼% senior notes, and $18 million of funds were provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options. We used $1.1 billion cash for net repayments of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, $25 million for the repayment of an installment note, and $4 million for the repurchase of our 7¼% Senior Debentures due August 1, 2097. We also paid $94 million in cash dividends on our common stock and used $1 million to repurchase shares of our common stock.   In comparison, during the first nine months of 2008, $223 million of funds were provided by a net increase in debt, $49 million of funds were provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options. We paid $84 million in cash dividends on our common stock and used $2 million to repurchase shares of our common stock.   Investing Activities Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures – Information for investing activities, which consist of capital spending (including seismic expense) on an accrual basis, is as follows:            Three Months Ended  September 30,       Nine Months Ended  September 30,          2009       2008       2009       2008          (in millions)      Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures                            Unproved Property Acquisition    $ 2     $ 36     $ 64     $ 299     Proved Property Acquisition      -       255       -       255     Exploration      22       142       167       385     Development      186       334       615       840     Corporate and Other      14       19       87       53     Total    $ 224     $ 786     $ 933     $ 1,832        Unproved property acquisition costs for the first nine months of 2009 included lease bonuses on deepwater lease blocks acquired as a result of the March 2009 central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. Unproved property acquisition costs for the first nine months of 2008 included lease bonuses on deepwater lease blocks acquired as a result of the March 2008 central Gulf of Mexico lease sale and the acquisition of properties in western Oklahoma in July 2008.           41      Table of Contents       Proved property acquisition costs for the first nine months of 2008 included the acquisition of producing properties in western Oklahoma in July 2008.   Property Sales – In February 2008, effective July 1, 2007, we sold our interest in Argentina for a sales price of $117.5 million. The gain on sale was deferred until second quarter 2009 when the Argentine government approved the sale.   Financing Activities Long-Term Debt – Our principal source of liquidity is an unsecured revolving credit facility that matures December 9, 2012. The commitment is $2.1 billion until December 9, 2011 at which time the commitment reduces to $1.8 billion. The credit facility (i) provides for credit facility fee rates that range from 5 basis points to 15 basis points per year depending upon our credit rating, (ii) makes available short-term loans up to an aggregate amount of $300 million and (iii) provides for interest rates that are based upon the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 20 basis points to 70 basis points depending upon our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility. The credit facility is with certain commercial lending institutions and is available for general corporate purposes.   In order to provide increased liquidity and lengthen our weighted average debt maturity, on February 27, 2009 we completed an underwritten public offering of $1 billion of 8¼% senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2019, receiving net proceeds of $989 million. We used substantially all of the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility.   As a result, at September 30, 2009, borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaled $535 million, leaving approximately $1.6 billion available for use. The weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the credit facility at September 30, 2009 was 0.56%.   On July 22, 2009, we repurchased $5 million of our 7¼% Senior Debentures due August 1, 2097, recognizing a debt extinguishment gain of $1 million, which is included in other non-operating (income) expense, net.    Our outstanding fixed-rate debt, including the new 8¼% senior unsecured notes and net of the repurchase discussed above, totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2009. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 7.73%, with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2097.   Our ratio of debt-to-book capital was 26% at both September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2008. We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes both long-term debt, excluding unamortized discount, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.   Short-Term Borrowings – In May 2009, we made the final $25 million installment payment to the seller of properties we purchased in 2007. Interest on the unpaid amount was due quarterly and accrued at a LIBOR rate plus .30%. The interest rate was 1.51% at the date of payment.   Our committed credit facility has been supplemented by short-term borrowings under various uncommitted credit lines used for working capital purposes. Uncommitted credit lines may be offered by certain banks from time to time at rates negotiated at the time of borrowing. There were no amounts outstanding under uncommitted credit lines at September 30, 2009 or December 31, 2008. Depending upon future credit market conditions, these sources may or may not be available. However, we are not dependent on them to fund our day-to-day operations.   Dividends – We paid total cash dividends of 54.0 cents per share of common stock during the first nine months of 2009 and 48.0 cents per share of common stock during the first nine months of 2008. On October 27, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18.0 cents per common share, payable November 23, 2009 to shareholders of record on November 9, 2009. The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.   Exercise of Stock Options – We received cash proceeds of $15 million from the exercise of stock options during the first nine months of 2009 as compared with $26 million during the first nine months of 2008.   Common Stock Repurchases – We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 20,464 shares with a value of $1 million during the first nine months of 2009 and 32,518 shares with a value of $2 million during the first nine months of 2008.            42      Table of Contents     ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   Commodity Price Risk Derivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes – We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.   At September 30, 2009, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps, collars and basis swaps related to crude oil and natural gas sales. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net payable position with a fair value of $18 million. Based on the September 30, 2009 published commodity futures price strips for the underlying commodities, a price increase of $1.00 per Bbl for crude oil would increase the fair value of our net commodity derivative payable by approximately $9 million. A price increase of $0.10 per MMBtu for natural gas would increase the fair value of our net commodity derivative payable by approximately $8 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.       Interest Rate Risk    Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other variable-rate debt and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.   At September 30, 2009, we had $2.2 billion (excluding unamortized discount) of long-term debt outstanding. Of this amount, $1.6 billion was fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.73%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss.    The remainder of our long-term debt, $535 million at September 30, 2009, was variable-rate debt drawn under our credit facility. Variable-rate debt exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to increases in market interest rates. We estimate that a hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the September 30, 2009 balance of our variable-rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $1 million.   We occasionally enter into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate “locks” used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At September 30, 2009, AOCL included $2 million, net of tax, related to interest rate locks. This amount is currently being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of our 5¼% Senior Notes due April 2014. We currently have no treasury locks outstanding.   We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances. As of September 30, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $926 million. Approximately 51% of this amount was invested in US Treasury securities, money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. A hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the amount invested as of September 30, 2009 would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately $1 million.       Foreign Currency Risk    The US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as foreign deferred tax liabilities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions, are denominated in a foreign currency. An increase in exchange rates between the US dollar and the currency of the foreign tax jurisdiction in which these liabilities are located could result in the use of additional cash to settle these liabilities. Transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and are included in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.    In the UK sector of our North Sea operations, significant future capital commitments and certain operating expenses are expected to be denominated in British pounds. Therefore, our cash flows could be impacted by future changes in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound. We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determined that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.           43      Table of Contents       DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:           ·   the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by us;            ·   our growth strategies;            ·   our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;            ·   anticipated trends in our business;            ·   our future results of operations;            ·   effect of current volatility in the credit markets;            ·   our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;            ·   market conditions in the oil and gas industry;            ·   our ability to make and integrate acquisitions; and            ·   the impact of governmental regulation.     Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our principal executive officer and our acting principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   See Item I. Financial Statements – Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, or our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, other than the following:  The adoption of pending climate change legislation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.   In June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, also known as the Waxman-Markey Bill. The U.S. Senate’s version, The Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, or the Boxer-Kerry Bill, has been introduced, but has not been passed. Although these bills include several differences that require reconciliation before becoming law, both bills contain the basic feature of establishing a “cap and trade” system for restricting greenhouse gas emissions in the US. Under such system, certain sources of greenhouse gas emissions would be required to obtain greenhouse gas emission “allowances” corresponding to their annual emissions of greenhouse gases. The number of emission allowances issued each year would decline as necessary to meet overall emission reduction goals. As the number of greenhouse gas emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. The ultimate outcome of this legislative initiative remains uncertain. However, since approximately 60% of our overall crude oil and 51% of our natural gas production derives from the US, any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of US greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas we produce.           44      Table of Contents       Federal hydraulic fracturing legislation could increase our costs and restrict our access to oil and gas reserves.   Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. We find that the use of hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of natural gas and oil from many reservoirs, including those in the Northern region of our US operations.   Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay our ability to develop oil and gas reserves.   Derivatives regulation could restrict our ability to execute commodity derivative instruments as a hedge against fluctuating commodity prices.   Various measures are being proposed by committees of Congress, the U.S. Treasury Department, and other agencies to restrict the use of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments. These proposals include, but are not limited to, requiring cash collateral on all OTC derivatives and requiring all OTC derivatives to be executed and settled through an exchange system.   Although we do not currently know the exact form any final legislation or rule-making activity will take, any restriction on the use of OTC instruments could have a significant impact on our business. Limits on the use of OTC instruments could significantly reduce our ability to execute strategic price hedges against commodity price volatility. In addition, cash collateral requirements could create significant liquidity issues and exchange system trades may restrict our ability to execute derivative instruments to fit our strategic needs.   Our operations and investment in Ecuador may be adversely affected by the country's unsettled economic and political environment.   The economic and political environment in Ecuador has become increasingly unsettled. We are aware of recent media reports of expropriation or nationalization attempts by the government of Ecuador involving other US or foreign companies with investments in the country. We continue to not be fully paid for electricity sales from our Machala power plant, and we recently entered into independent power purchase agreements for such sales, the effect of which on payment is unknown. In addition, on August 24, 2009, we became aware that our proposed plan of development for the Amistad field (offshore Ecuador), which had been submitted to the government of Ecuador, had been rejected.
