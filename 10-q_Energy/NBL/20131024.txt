Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 – Federal or state hydraulic fracturing legislation could increase our costs or restrict our access to oil and gas reserves.Update on Israel's Natural Gas EconomyAntitrust Authority   The Israeli Antitrust Commissioner has been actively engaged to encourage competition in developing Israel's natural gas resources. The Antitrust Commissioner ruled that all domestic natural gas sales contracts are subject to review and approval of the Antitrust Authority and has intervened regarding the terms used in long term contracts with certain end users. In addition, the Antitrust Commissioner has alleged that the Leviathan license acquisition agreement is a restrictive arrangement and has publicly expressed concerns regarding ownership concentration in exploration blocks and development projects and its potential impacts on a competitive domestic natural gas price environment and end user electricity costs. We continue to engage with the Israeli government on this matter. Antitrust Commissioner decisions and actions to increase competition could result in a requirement to divest assets, reduce or relinquish revenue interests, and/or implement the marketing of our working interest share of production. Natural Gas Export   The Israeli government is also in the process of developing a natural gas export policy. In September 2012, the Tzemach Committee issued its final recommendations on government policy for developing the natural gas economy (the Tzemach Report). See Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties – Regulations – Israeli Interministerial Committee in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.On June 23, 2013, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan for natural gas exports and other natural gas development related matters. However, certain members of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, have demanded that natural gas policy, including exports, be legislated by the Knesset as opposed to a Cabinet ruling. This matter was appealed to the Israeli High Court of Justice (High Court). The High Court rejected the appeal on October 21, 2013.With our partners, we are continuing to study the official export and natural gas development policies and are monitoring any additional developments to assess the possible impact, positive or negative, of any resulting laws or regulations on our future development activities in Israel. Certain changes in Israel's fiscal and/or regulatory regimes or energy policies occurring as a result of Antitrust Authority rulings or government policy on natural gas development and/or exports could: delay or reduce the profitability of our Tamar and/or Leviathan development projects; delay closing of a farm-out agreement which we are currently negotiating with Woodside or preclude such an agreement entirely; and/or render future exploration and development 29Table of Contents   projects uneconomic. We continue to work with the Israeli government in support of establishing a stable investment climate to allow for future development of Israel's natural gas economy, which we believe will bring significant economic benefits to the state and citizens of Israel.See also Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 – Our international operations may be adversely affected by economic and political developments.Update on Cyber SecurityIn 2013, cyber attacks against US corporations have escalated, and we believe that cyber attackers are actively looking for ways to gain access to the networks and information of US oil and gas companies, including Noble Energy. While some attacks on US companies have resulted in theft of intellectual property or financial assets, other attacks have included infiltration, denial of service efforts, business disruption, or surveillance and control of computer systems with an apparent hostile intent. For example, it has been reported that hackers were able to gain access to control-system software that could allow manipulation of oil or gas pipeline operations. Such manipulation could include the deletion of important data or the disabling of key safety features.Information technology and infrastructure may also be breached due to employee or contractor error or malfeasance or by other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of information. We continuously look for ways to enhance our cyber security controls and procedures, including the deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, employee awareness and training, and application of learnings and best practices gained from other companies and government engagement. We continue to face cyber threats, as do general industry and the oil and gas sector. Specifically, we are aware that we are at risk of cyber threats from hackers that are hostile to countries in which we operate. As these and other cyber threats evolve, we expect to expend additional financial or employee resources to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.See also Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 – A cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.Risk and Insurance ProgramOur business is subject to all of the inherent and unplanned operating risks normally associated with the exploration, production, gathering, processing, transportation and marketing of crude oil and natural gas. Such risks include hurricanes, blowouts, well cratering, fire, loss of well control, pipeline disruptions, mishandling of fluids and chemicals and possible underground migration of hydrocarbons and chemicals, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, crude oil and natural gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property, environmental pollution, injury to persons, or loss of life. As protection against financial loss resulting from many, but not all of these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including certain physical damage, business interruption (loss of production income), employer's liability, third party liability and worker's compensation insurance. We maintain insurance at levels that we believe are appropriate and consistent with industry practice and we regularly review our potential risks of loss and the cost and availability of insurance and the company's ability to sustain uninsured losses, and revise our insurance program accordingly. Limits and deductibles were revised for the property and business interruption programs, as well as the excess liability program, in the first half of the year. We carry some business interruption insurance for loss of production income arising from physical damage to our major facilities. The coverage is subject to customary deductibles, waiting periods and recovery limits. We also maintain credit insurance to mitigate commodity receivables concentration risk.Availability of insurance coverage, subject to customary deductibles and recovery limits, for certain perils such as war or political risk is often excluded or limited within property policies. In Israel and Equatorial Guinea, we insure against acts of war and terrorism in addition to providing insurance coverage for normal operating hazards facing our business. Additionally, as being part of critical national infrastructure, the Israel offshore and onshore assets are included in a special property coverage afforded under the Israeli government's Property Tax and Compensation Fund law; however, the amount of financial recovery through the fund is not guaranteed.In the Gulf of Mexico, we self-insure for windstorm related exposures. Currently, our Gulf of Mexico assets are primarily subsea operations; therefore, our direct windstorm exposure is limited. However, we do have some exposure through the use of third party production platforms. In addition, the cost of windstorm insurance continues to be very expensive and coverage amounts are limited. As a result, we currently believe it is more cost-effective for us to self-insure, or absorb any physical loss or damage to these assets, including any business interruption attributable to windstorm exposures. We continually assess our offshore insurance needs in response to our changing business requirements. 30Table of Contents   As is customary with industry practice, crude oil and natural gas well owners generally indemnify drilling rig contractors against certain risks, such as those arising from property and environmental losses, pollution from sources such as oil spills, or contamination resulting from well blowout or fire or other uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons. Most of our US and international drilling contracts contain such indemnification clauses. In addition, crude oil and natural gas well owners typically assume all costs of well control in the event of an uncontrolled well. We currently carry more than $800 million in insurance protection, depending on our ownership interest, for potential financial losses occurring as a result of events such as the Deepwater Horizon Incident of 2010. This protection consists of more than $600 million of well control, pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage and more than $200 million of additional pollution cleanup and consequential damages coverage, which also covers third-party personal injury and death.We have contracts with third-party service providers to perform hydraulic fracturing operations for us. The master service agreements signed by hydraulic fracturing contractors contain indemnification provisions similar to those noted above. Our liability insurance policies do not contain any specific exclusion for liabilities from hydraulic fracturing operations and we believe our policies would cover third party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of such policies. We do not have insurance for gradual pollution nor do we have coverage for penalties or fines that may be assessed by a governmental authority.We expect the future availability and cost of insurance to be impacted by the various catastrophic events and large losses that insurers have incurred over the past several years. Impacts could include tighter underwriting standards, limitations on scope and amount of coverage, and higher premiums. We have a risk assessment program that analyzes safety and environmental hazards and establishes procedures, work practices, training programs and equipment requirements, including monitoring and maintenance rules, for continuous improvement. We also use third party consultants to help us identify and quantify our risk exposures at major facilities. We have a robust prevention program and continue to manage our risks and operations such that we believe the likelihood of a significant event is remote. However, if an event occurs that is not covered by insurance, not fully protected by insured limits or our non-operating partners are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Oil Spill Response Preparedness We maintain membership in Clean Gulf Associates (CGA), a nonprofit association of production and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico, for surface spill response. We are a member of HWCG, a deepwater well containment group, which has contracted with Helix Energy Solutions Group (HESG) for the provision of subsea intervention, containment, capture and shut-in capacity for deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells. The system, known as the Helix Fast Response System (HFRS), at full production capacity, can contain well leaks up to 55 MBbl/d of oil, 70 MBbl/d of liquids and 95 MMcf/d of natural gas, at 10,000 pounds per square inch (psi) in water depths to 10,000 feet. Resources also include a 15,000 psi-gauge intervention capping stack designed to shut-in wells in water depths to 10,000 feet, including extremely high-pressure, deeper wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.In May, we successfully led a full-scale deployment of critical well control equipment to assess our ability to respond to a potential subsea blowout in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The drill was a collaborative test between the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), the U.S. Coast Guard, Louisiana Offshore Coordinator's Office and all 15 member companies of the HWCG consortium. Activation of the HWCG rapid response system and deployment of the HWCG capping stack to pressurization requirements met all objectives and marked the successful completion of the exercise.31Table of Contents   RESULTS OF OPERATIONSIn the discussion below, prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the North Sea segment as discontinued operations.

This ratio reflects an energy content equivalency and not a price or revenue equivalency. Given commodity price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas is significantly less than the price for a barrel of oil.(2) Natural gas from the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea is under contract for $0.25 per MMBtu to a methanol plant, an LPG plant, an LNG plant and a power generation plant. The methanol and LPG plants are owned by affiliated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting.(3) Israel's weighted average natural gas price for third quarter 2013 represents 207 MMcf/d sold at an average price of $5.46 per Mcf under Tamar gas sale and purchase agreements (GSPAs) and 48 MMcf/d sold at an average price of $3.43 per Mcf under Mari-B GSPAs.33Table of Contents   Israel's weighted average natural gas price for the nine months ending September 30, 2013 represents 133 MMcf/d sold at an average price of $5.32 per Mcf under Tamar GSPAs and 63 MMcf/d sold at an average price of $4.44 per Mcf under Mari-B GSPAs.(4) Volumes represent sales of condensate and LPG from the Alba plant in Equatorial Guinea.

Natural gas sales – Revenues from natural gas sales increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 as compared with 2012 due to the following:•increases in total consolidated average realized prices primarily due to increased demand from expectations of cooler weather and higher-than-expected inventory withdrawals;•higher sales volumes in Israel from two full quarters of sales from Tamar, which contributed 207 Mmcf/d during the third quarter of 2013 and 133 Mmcf/d during the first nine months of 2013;34Table of Contents   •higher sales volumes of 397 Mmcf/d in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale primarily attributable to our horizontal drilling programs; partially offset by:•lower sales volumes due to divestitures of certain onshore US properties in the third quarter of 2012, which has continued during the first nine months of 2013; and •lower sales volumes due to natural field decline from Mari B, Noa and Pinnacles, offshore Israel, which contributed a combined 63 Mmcf/d for the first nine months of 2013, compared with 95 Mmcf/d for the first nine months of 2012.NGL sales – The majority of our US NGL production is currently from the DJ Basin. NGL sales revenues decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 as compared with 2012, primarily due to declines in sales volumes. NGL sales in the DJ Basin decreased by 2 Mboe/d during the third quarter of 2013 as compared with 2012, and recent sales of our non-core onshore US properties have reduced sales volumes by 1 Mboe/d as compared with the third quarter of 2012. Additionally, sales prices have declined for the first nine months of 2013, compared to the first nine months of 2012 due to high US NGL supply, which has exerted downward pressure on prices.Income from Equity Method Investees  We have a 45% interest in Atlantic Methanol Production Company, LLC, which owns and operates a methanol plant and related facilities, and a 28% interest in Alba Plant LLC, which owns and operates a liquefied petroleum gas processing plant.

Financial Statements – Note 11. Segment Information.(2) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.Total DD&A expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 increased as compared with 2012 due to the following:•higher sales volumes combined with development growth in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale;•additional DD&A from the start up of Alen, offshore Equatorial Guinea, which began production in late second quarter of 2013; Galapagos, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which began production in the second quarter of 2012; and Tamar, offshore Israel, which began production in late first quarter of 2013;partially offset by:•the impact of divestitures of non-core onshore US properties in 2012;•lower DD&A from Mari-B, offshore Israel, due to natural field decline and decreased book value from 2012 impairment;•lower DD&A from Raton South, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, due to decreased book value from 2012 impairment; and•downtime at Swordfish, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, due to mechanical repairs in 2013. Changes in the unit rate per BOE for the third quarter 2013 as compared with 2012 were primarily due to start-up of Tamar field, offshore Israel, and the Alen field, offshore Equatorial Guinea, as both these areas have comparatively lower DD&A rates, along with increased activity in the DJ Basin, which has a higher DD&A rate.Changes in the unit rate per BOE for the first nine months of 2013 as compared with 2012 were due to changes in the mix of production, primarily due to volumes from the start-up of the Noa, Pinnacles and Galapagos projects, which have comparatively higher DD&A rates.General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expense (G&A) was as follows:  Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012G&A Expense (millions)$109 $93 $324 $286Unit Rate per BOE (1)$4.14 $4.31 $4.59 $4.61(1) Consolidated unit rates exclude sales volumes and expenses attributable to equity method investees.G&A expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 increased as compared with 2012 primarily due to additional expenses relating to personnel, office, and information technology costs in support of our major development projects and increased exploration activities.Gain on Divestitures  Gain on divestitures was as follows: Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012(millions)       Gain on Divestitures$— $(157) $(12) $(167)See Item 1.

Divestitures.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCapital Structure/Financing StrategyIn seeking to effectively fund and monetize our major development projects, we employ a capital structure and financing strategy designed to provide sufficient liquidity throughout the commodity price cycle. Specifically, we strive to retain the ability to fund long cycle, multi-year, capital intensive development projects throughout a range of scenarios, while also maintaining the capability to execute a robust exploration program and capitalize on financially attractive periodic mergers and acquisitions activity. We endeavor to maintain an investment grade debt rating in service of these objectives, while delivering competitive returns and a growing dividend. We also utilize a commodity price hedging program to reduce the impacts of commodity price volatility and enhance the predictability of cash flows along with a risk and insurance program to protect against disruption to our cash flows and the funding of our business.We strive to maintain a minimum liquidity level to address volatility and risk. Traditional sources of our liquidity are cash flows from operations, available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility, cash on hand, and proceeds from sales of non-core properties, such as certain onshore US and North Sea properties in 2013 and 2012. We may also access the capital markets to ensure adequate liquidity exists in the form of unutilized capacity under our Credit Facility, under which we had borrowed $800 million at September 30, 2013, and to refinance scheduled debt maturities. We have $200 million of scheduled current maturities due by the end of the second quarter of 2014. See Credit Facility below. As we ramp up the development of our major projects, as well as our planned exploration and appraisal drilling activities, we recognize that over the near term our capital expenditures will exceed cash flows from operating activities. During the first nine months of 2013, our cash balance decreased $449 million. The extent to which capital investment will continue to exceed operating cash flows depends on our success in sanctioning future development projects, the results of our exploration activities, and new business opportunities as well as external factors such as commodity prices, among others. Our financial capacity, coupled with our balanced and diversified portfolio, provides 40Table of Contents   us with flexibility in our investment decisions including execution of our major development projects and increased exploration activity.To support our investment program, we expect that higher production resulting from our horizontal Niobrara development program combined with new production from Tamar, which began producing late in the first quarter of 2013, and Alen, which began producing late in the second quarter of 2013, will result in an increase in cash flows which will be available to meet a substantial portion of future capital commitments. We also evaluate potential strategic farm-out arrangements of our working interests in Israel, Cyprus, Cameroon, Nicaragua and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for reimbursement of our capital spending in these areas. In addition, our current liquidity level and balance sheet, along with our ability to access the capital markets, provide flexibility. We believe that we are well-positioned to fund our long-term growth plans. See Available Liquidity, below.We are currently evaluating potential development scenarios for our significant natural gas discoveries offshore Eastern Mediterranean, including Leviathan and Cyprus Block 12. The magnitude of these discoveries presents financial and technical challenges for us due to the large-scale development requirements. Potential development scenarios may include the construction of LNG terminals, floating LNG, FPSO, subsea pipeline or other options. Each of these development options would require a multi-billion dollar investment and a number of years to complete. We have announced a potential strategic partner for Leviathan, Woodside, who could provide midstream expertise as well as LNG project execution and marketplace expertise. We are in the process of negotiating a definitive agreement. Available Liquidity Information regarding cash and debt balances was as follows:  September 30, December 31, 2013 2012(millions, except percentages)   Cash and Cash Equivalents$938 $1,387Amount Available to be Borrowed Under Credit Facility (1)3,200 4,000Total Liquidity$4,138 $5,387Total Debt (2)$4,614 $4,123Total Shareholders' Equity9,064 8,258Ratio of Debt-to-Book Capital (3)34% 33% (1) See Credit Facility below.(2) Total debt includes FPSO and other capital lease obligations and the remaining CONSOL installment payment (at December 31, 2012) and excludes unamortized debt discount.(3) We define our ratio of debt-to-book capital as total debt (which includes long-term debt excluding unamortized discount, the current portion of long-term debt, and short-term borrowings) divided by the sum of total debt plus shareholders’ equity.Cash and Cash Equivalents We had approximately $938 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2013, primarily denominated in US dollars and invested in money market funds and short-term deposits with major financial institutions. Approximately $755 million of this cash is attributable to our foreign subsidiaries and a portion would be subject to US income taxes if repatriated. We are currently developing our 2014 capital investment program. If the 2014 capital investment program is expected to exceed operating cash flows, the difference could be funded from a variety of sources including cash on hand, borrowings under our Credit Facility, other financing such as an issuance of long-term debt, or proceeds from non-core asset divestment. In addition, we may consider repatriation possibilities.Credit Facility We have an unsecured revolving Credit Facility that matures on October 3, 2018. The commitment is $4.0 billion through the maturity date of the Credit Facility. On October 3, 2013, we amended the Credit Facility by extending the maturity date from October 14, 2016 to October 3, 2018.Derivative Instruments  We use various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil and natural gas sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs. Such instruments include variable to fixed price commodity swaps, two and three-way collars and put options. Our practice has been to hedge up to 50% of our forecasted hedgeable crude oil and natural gas production for the current year plus two additional calendar years. The limit was recently increased to up to 75% of forecasted hedgeable global crude oil production for the years 2014 and 2015. Current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity, since we are either paying cash to, or receiving cash from, our counterparties. We net settle by counterparty based on master netting agreements. The net settlements take into account deferred premiums we have agreed to pay for put options. None of our counterparty agreements contain 41Table of Contents   margin requirements. We have also used derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk by entering into forward contracts or swap agreements to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with fixed or floating rate borrowings. However, we currently have no interest rate derivative instruments.Commodity derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. As of September 30, 2013, the fair value of our commodity derivative assets was $46 million and the fair value of our commodity derivative liabilities was $41 million (after consideration of netting clauses within our master agreements).  See Item 1. Financial Statements –Note 6. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for a description of the methods we use to estimate the fair values of derivative instruments and Counterparty Credit Risk, below, for a discussion of credit risk.U. S. Fiscal Environment   The 2014 Presidential budget proposes the elimination of specific tax incentives related to oil, natural gas and coal companies. The President remains focused on increasing taxes on the oil and gas industry, specifically the elimination of expense treatment of intangible drilling and development costs. The discussions of a full tax reform continue with Congress and the Obama Administration divided over these issues. We continue to monitor these events and any potential impacts to our business.European Debt Crisis The fallout from the European debt crisis continues to have a negative impact on the European economy, with risks to the global financial system and overall global economy. Some countries have implemented austerity measures including raising taxes and reducing entitlements, but are still struggling to pay off their debts, and the major bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, has limited lending capacity. In many cases, the banking community across the region has undergone consolidation, restructuring and increased regulatory governance. Some of the European banks are counterparties in our commodity hedging program and lenders in our Credit Facility. If these institutions receive credit downgrades, our internal risk guidelines could preclude further hedging activities with them. At this time, we believe our current balance sheet and financial flexibility enhance our ability to react to European events as they unfold.Counterparty Credit Risk We monitor the creditworthiness of our trade creditors, joint venture partners, hedging counterparties, and financial institutions on an ongoing basis. Some of these entities are not as creditworthy as we are and may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems. Credit downgrades or liquidity problems could result in a delay in our receiving proceeds from commodity sales or reimbursement of joint venture costs.The current uncertain economic and commodity price environment increases the risk of a sudden negative change in liquidity, which could impair a party's ability to perform under the terms of a contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a party's creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict such sudden changes, our ability to negate these risks may be limited and we could incur significant financial losses.In addition, nonoperating partners often must obtain financing for their share of capital cost for development projects. For example, our Eastern Mediterranean partners must obtain financing for their share of significant development expenditures at Leviathan, offshore Israel, which potentially includes an LNG project and/or major underwater pipeline. In conjunction with our negotiations with Woodside, we are assisting our current Leviathan partners to obtain appropriate financing for their share of development costs and considering providing a limited amount of financial backstop to them. A partner's inability to obtain financing could result in a delay of one of our joint development projects.Credit enhancements have been obtained from some parties in the form of parental guarantees, letters of credit or credit insurance; however, not all of our counterparty credit is protected through guarantees or credit support. Nonperformance by a trade creditor, joint venture partner, hedging counterparty or financial institution could result in significant financial losses.Contractual ObligationsCONSOL Carried Cost Obligation The CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation represents our agreement to fund up to approximately $2.1 billion of CONSOL’s future drilling and completion costs. The CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation is capped at $400 million in each calendar year and is suspended if average Henry Hub natural gas prices fall and remain below $4.00 per MMBtu in any three consecutive month period and will remain suspended until average Henry Hub natural gas prices are above $4.00 per MMBtu for three consecutive months. The CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation is currently suspended. Based on the September 30, 2013 NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price curve, we forecast our CONSOL Carried Cost Obligation will remain suspended for the next 12 months.42Table of Contents   Cash FlowsCash flow information is as follows: Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2013 2012(millions)   Total Cash Provided By (Used in)   Operating Activities$2,153 $2,171Investing Activities(2,937) (1,559)Financing Activities335 (450)Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents$(449) $162Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2013 remained flat as compared with 2012. Higher natural gas sales prices and an increase in crude oil and natural gas sales volumes were offset by slightly lower crude oil sales prices and increases in production expenses and general and administrative expense. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Investing Activities Our investing activities include capital spending on a cash basis for oil and gas properties and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method. These investing activities may be offset by proceeds from property sales or dispositions, including farm-in arrangements, which may result in reimbursement for capital spending that had been previously incurred by us. Capital spending for property, plant and equipment increased by $336 million during the first nine months of 2013 as compared with 2012, primarily due to increased development in the DJ Basin and Marcellus Shale and corporate building improvements, partially offset by a decline in spending based on the project life cycle of recently-completed major projects offshore West Africa and offshore Israel. We received $119 million net proceeds primarily from non-core asset divestitures during the first nine months of 2013 as compared with $1.2 billion from divestiture activity during the first nine months of 2012.Financing Activities  Our financing activities include the issuance or repurchase of our common stock, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, the borrowing of cash and the repayment of borrowings. During the first nine months of 2013, funds were provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options ($54 million) and cash proceeds from our Credit Facility ($800 million). We used cash to make the final CONSOL installment payment ($328 million), pay dividends on our common stock ($146 million), make principal payments related to the Aseng FPSO capital lease obligation ($31 million) and repurchase shares of our common stock ($14 million).In comparison, during the first nine months of 2012, funds were provided by cash proceeds from, and tax benefits related to, the exercise of stock options ($42 million). We also used cash to make the first CONSOL installment payment ($328 million), pay dividends on our common stock ($119 million), make principal payments related to the Aseng FPSO capital lease obligation ($32 million) and repurchase shares of our common stock ($13 million).See Item 1. Financial Statements – Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.43Table of Contents   Investing ActivitiesAcquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures  Information for investing activities (on an accrual basis) is as follows: Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012(millions)       Acquisition, Capital and Exploration Expenditures       Unproved Property Acquisition$34 $(38) $168 $49Exploration275 95 660 316Development795 648 2,169 2,102Corporate and Other35 19 159 44Total$1,139 $724 $3,156 $2,511        Other       Investment in Equity Method Investee$8 $— $30 $35Increase in Capital Lease Obligations18 — 54 —2013  Unproved property acquisition costs for the first nine months of 2013 were primarily related to acquisitions that strengthened our positions in the DJ Basin, Marcellus Shale and deepwater Gulf of Mexico.2012  Unproved property acquisition costs for the first nine months of 2012 included downward adjustments related to the Marcellus Shale acquisition, offset by acquisitions that strengthened our positions in the DJ Basin and deepwater Gulf of Mexico along with entry into a license offshore Sierra Leone (West Africa). Investment in equity method investees represents funding of our investment in CONE Gathering LLC (CONE) which owns and operates the infrastructure associated with our Marcellus Shale joint venture.The increase in capital lease obligations represents estimated construction in progress to date on US operating assets. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 5. Debt. Financing ActivitiesLong-Term Debt Our principal source of liquidity is a Credit Facility that matures October 3, 2018. We utilized the Credit Facility to engage in short-term borrowing arrangements during the first nine months of 2013. In addition, at September 30, 2013, we had $800 million outstanding under the Credit Facility, leaving $3.2 billion available for use. We expect to use the Credit Facility to fund our capital investment program, and we may periodically borrow amounts for working capital purposes. See Item 1 Financial Statements – Note 5. Debt.Our outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding FPSO and other capital lease obligations) totaled approximately $3.5 billion at September 30, 2013. The weighted average interest rate on fixed-rate debt was 6.28%, with maturities ranging from April 2014 to August 2097. Approximately $200 million of our fixed rate debt is scheduled to mature by the end of the second quarter of 2014.Dividends We paid total cash dividends of 41 cents per share of our common stock during the first nine months of 2013 and 33 cents per share during the first nine months of 2012 (as adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split during the second quarter of 2013). The amount of future dividends will be determined on a quarterly basis at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors.Exercise of Stock Options We received cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $39 million during the first nine months of 2013 and $28 million during the first nine months of 2012.Common Stock Repurchases We receive shares of common stock from employees for the payment of withholding taxes due on the vesting of restricted shares issued under stock-based compensation plans. We received 247,985 shares with a value of $14 million during the first nine months of 2013 and 264,968 shares with a value of $13 million during the first nine months of 2012. 44Table of Contents   Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskCommodity Price RiskDerivative Instruments Held for Non-Trading Purposes We are exposed to market risk in the normal course of business operations, and the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry. Due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to use derivative instruments as a means of managing our exposure to price changes.At September 30, 2013, we had entered into variable to fixed price commodity swaps, collars and put options related to crude oil and natural gas sales. Changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments are reported in earnings in the period in which they occur. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of $5 million. Based on the September 30, 2013 published commodity futures price curves for the underlying commodities, a hypothetical price increase of $1.00 per Bbl for crude oil would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by approximately $37 million. A hypothetical price increase of $0.10 per MMBtu for natural gas would decrease the fair value of our net commodity derivative asset by approximately $12 million. Our derivative instruments are executed under master agreements which allow us, in the event of default, to elect early termination of all contracts with the defaulting counterparty. If we choose to elect early termination, all asset and liability positions with the defaulting counterparty would be net cash settled at the time of election. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note 4. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.Interest Rate RiskChanges in interest rates affect the amount of interest we pay on borrowings under our Credit Facility and the amount of interest we earn on our short-term investments.At September 30, 2013, we had approximately $4.3 billion (excluding FPSO and other capital lease obligations) of long-term debt outstanding. Of this amount, $3.5 billion was fixed-rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.28%. Although near term changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, they do not expose us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss.The remainder of our long-term debt, $800 million at September 30, 2013, was variable-rate debt. Variable-rate debt exposes us to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to increases in market interest rates. We estimate that a hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the September 30, 2013 balance of our variable-rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately $2 million.We occasionally enter into interest rate derivative instruments such as forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in fair value of interest rate derivative instruments used as cash flow hedges are reported in AOCL, to the extent the hedge is effective, until the forecasted transaction occurs, at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense. At September 30, 2013, AOCL included $24 million, net of tax, related to interest rate derivative instruments. This amount is currently being reclassified to earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the terms of our 5¼% senior notes due April 15, 2014 and 6% senior notes due March 1, 2041. See Item 1. Financial Statements – Note  4. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.We are also exposed to interest rate risk related to our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents balances. As of September 30, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $938 million, approximately 49% of which was invested in money market funds and short-term investments with major financial institutions. A hypothetical 25 basis point change in the floating interest rates applicable to the amount invested as of September 30, 2013 would result in a change in annual interest income of approximately $1 million.Foreign Currency RiskThe US dollar is considered the functional currency for each of our international operations. Substantially all of our international crude oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold pursuant to US dollar denominated contracts. Transactions, such as operating costs and administrative expenses that are paid in a foreign currency, are remeasured into US dollars and recorded in the financial statements at prevailing currency exchange rates. Certain monetary assets and liabilities, such as taxes payable in foreign tax jurisdictions, are settled in the foreign local currency. A reduction in the value of the US dollar against currencies of other countries in which we have material operations could result in the use of additional cash to settle operating, administrative, and tax liabilities. Net transaction gains and losses were de minimis for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2013. Net transaction gains (losses) totaled $2 million for the third quarter and ($4) million for the first nine months of 2012. The losses were primarily related to the changes in exchange rates between the US dollar and Israeli new shekel. Transaction (gains) losses are included in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.45Table of Contents   We currently have no foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding. However, we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments (such as forward contracts, costless collars or swap agreements) in the future if we determine that it is necessary to invest in such instruments in order to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk.Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:•our growth strategies;•our ability to successfully and economically explore for and develop crude oil and natural gas resources;•anticipated trends in our business;•our future results of operations;•our liquidity and ability to finance our exploration and development activities;•market conditions in the oil and gas industry;•our ability to make and integrate acquisitions;•the impact of governmental fiscal terms and/or regulation, such as those involving the protection of the environment or marketing of production, as well as other regulations; and•access to resources.Forward-looking statements are typically identified by use of terms such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. These forward-looking statements are made based upon our current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should consider carefully the statements under Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 is available on our website at www.nobleenergyinc.com.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresBased on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, each of them has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are effective. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.46Part II. Other InformationItem 1. Legal ProceedingsWest Virginia Matter   In March 2013, we received seven Notices of Violation (NOV) and two Administrative Orders (Orders) from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection Office of Oil and Gas (OOG) regarding the unintentional discharge of a mixture of freshwater and produced water that occurred on or about the evening of February 22, 2013 from one of our permitted water storage facilities in Marshall County, West Virginia. At this time, the OOG has not established a proposed penalty for these NOVs or Orders. Given the uncertainty in administrative actions of this nature, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this action at this time. However, we believe that the resolution of these proceedings through settlement or adverse judgment will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Colorado Matters  In April 2013, we received a proposed Early Settlement Agreement (ESA) from Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Air Pollution Control Division to resolve allegations of noncompliance with our 2011 Ozone and Non-Ozone season submissions pursuant to Air Quality Control Commission Regulation 7. The ESA sought payment of a reduced penalty of $112,000. On June 18, 2013, we accepted the reduced penalty and executed a Compliance Order on Consent (COC). Under the terms and conditions of the COC, we agreed to pursue a supplemental environmental project (SEP) to mitigate $89,600 of the total penalty and submitted payment of $22,400 as an administrative penalty. On September 5, 2013, we provided $89,600 to the Colorado Energy Office to serve as funding for the development and implementation of an energy efficiency educational outreach program for students. All penalties associated with this matter have now been paid. In July 2013, we received a proposed Compliance Order on Consent (COC) from Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Air Pollution Control Division to resolve allegations of noncompliance with our 2012 Ozone Season submissions pursuant to Air Quality Control Commission Regulation 7. The COC sought payment of a reduced penalty of $156,450. On August 7, 2013, we accepted the reduced penalty and executed the COC. Under the terms and conditions of the COC, we agreed to pursue a supplemental environmental project (SEP) to mitigate $125,160 of the total penalty and submitted payment of $31,290 as an administrative penalty. The SEP's $125,160 is currently intended to assist with the American Lung Association of Colorado's development and implementation of its Clear the Air Challenge, which is a pollution prevention and environmental education program that focuses on the reduction and/or elimination of pollutants, to help preserve the region's air quality through conservation of transportation related energy.Item 1A.
