Item 1A. Risk Factors.  As of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of Schlumberger’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, except as follows:  The merger with Smith will be dilutive to Schlumberger’s earnings per share in the near term, which may negatively affect the market price of Schlumberger common stock.  Our recently completed merger with Smith will be dilutive to earnings per share in the near term. Future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including adverse changes in:        •    energy market conditions;        •    commodity prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;        •    production levels;        •    reserve levels;        •    operating results;        •    competitive conditions;        •    laws and regulations affecting the energy business;        •    capital expenditure obligations; and        •    general economic conditions.  Any dilution of, or decrease or delay of any accretion to, Schlumberger’s earnings per share could cause the price of Schlumberger’s common stock to decline.  Our offshore oil and gas operations could be adversely impacted by the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig accident and resulting oil spill; changes in and compliance with restrictions or regulations on offshore drilling in the US Gulf of Mexico and in other areas around the world may adversely affect our business and operating results.  On April 20, 2010, a fire and explosion occurred onboard the semisubmersible drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, owned by Transocean Ltd. and under contract to a subsidiary of BP plc. As a result of the incident and related oil spill, the Secretary of the US Department of the Interior directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEM, to issue a suspension until November 30, 2010 of drilling activities for specified drilling configurations and technologies. Although this moratorium was lifted on October 12, 2010, effective immediately, we cannot predict with certainty when drilling operations will resume in the US Gulf of Mexico. The BOEM has also issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety, environmental matters, drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the US Gulf of Mexico, and may take other additional steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production, reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays.    39    Table of Contents   At this time, we cannot predict with any certainty what further impact, if any, the Deepwater Horizon incident may have on the regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity, or on the cost or availability of insurance coverage to cover the risks of such operations. Ongoing effects of and delays from the lifted suspension of drilling activity in the US Gulf of Mexico, or the enactment of new or stricter regulations in the United States and other countries where we operate, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Demand for our products and services could be reduced or eliminated by governmental regulation or a change in the law.  International, national, and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climate-related legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is taking steps to require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions and to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). The EPA’s “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” rule established a comprehensive scheme of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions that began in 2010. Furthermore, the EPA recently proposed additional GHG reporting rules specifically for the oil and gas industry. The EPA has also published a final rule, the “Endangerment Finding,” finding that GHGs in the atmosphere endanger public health and welfare, and that emissions of GHGs from mobile sources cause or contribute to the GHG pollution. Following issuance of the Endangerment Finding, the EPA promulgated final motor vehicle GHG emission standards on April 1, 2010. The EPA has asserted that the final motor vehicle GHG emission standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources. In addition, climate change legislation is pending in the United States Congress. These developments may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services and products, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations. Additionally, legislation to reduce greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on our operations, including payment of additional costs due to carbon emissions. Higher carbon emission activities include transportation, including marine vessels, cement production (by third party suppliers), and electricity generation (by third party suppliers) as well as other activities. Finally, our business could be negatively affected by climate change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns, which could result in damages to or loss of our physical assets, impacts to our ability to conduct operations and/or disruption of our customers’ operations.  Legislation is pending in the United States Congress that would authorize the EPA to regulate hydraulic fracturing. The legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals that could adversely affect drinking water supplies. In addition a number of states are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations or legislation could reduce demand for pressure pumping services. If federal and/or state legislation or regulations were enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to predict whether the proposed legislation, regulations, or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted.      Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
