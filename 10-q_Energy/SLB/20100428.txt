Item 1A. Risk Factors.  As of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of Schlumberger’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, except as follows:  The ability of Smith and Schlumberger to complete the merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including the approval of Smith stockholders and the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or cause the merger to be abandoned.  The merger agreement contains closing conditions, including approval of the merger by Smith stockholders, the absence of injunctions or other legal restrictions and no material adverse effect having occurred with respect to either company. In addition, Smith and Schlumberger will be unable to complete the merger until approvals are received from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, the European Commission and various other governmental entities. We can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the merger. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger.  Failure to complete the merger with Smith could negatively impact Schlumberger’s stock price and our future business and financial results.   If the merger with Smith is not completed, the ongoing businesses and the market price of the common stock of Schlumberger may be adversely affected and Schlumberger will be subject to several risks, including being required, under specified circumstances, to pay Smith a termination fee of $615 million; having to pay certain costs relating to the merger; and diverting the focus of management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to Schlumberger, in each case, without realizing any of the benefits that might have resulted had the merger been completed.  The pendency of the merger could adversely affect Schlumberger.  In connection with the pending merger, some of Schlumberger’s customers may delay or defer purchasing decisions, which could negatively impact revenues, earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the merger is completed. Additionally, Schlumberger has agreed in the merger agreement to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to its business and financial affairs during the pendency of the merger. These restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time if completion of the merger is delayed, and could adversely impact Schlumberger’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Schlumberger’s stockholders will be diluted by the merger.  The merger will dilute the ownership position of Schlumberger’s current stockholders. We currently estimate that, upon completion of the merger, Schlumberger’s stockholders before the merger will own approximately 87% of the combined company and former Smith stockholders will own approximately 13% of the combined company’s outstanding common stock.    27    Table of Contents Following the merger, Schlumberger may be unable to successfully integrate Smith’s and Schlumberger’s businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.  The merger involves the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent public companies. Schlumberger will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating the two companies’ business practices and operations. Potential difficulties that Schlumberger may encounter in the integration process include the following:        •    the inability to integrate the Smith and Schlumberger businesses in a manner that permits Schlumberger to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the merger, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the merger not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;        •    lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;        •    integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and customer service;        •    potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and        •    performance shortfalls at the combined company as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies’ operations.  Business issues currently faced by one company may be imputed to the operations of the other company.  To the extent that either Schlumberger or Smith currently has or is perceived by customers to have operational challenges, such as on-time performance, safety issues or workforce issues, those challenges may raise concerns by existing customers of the other company following the merger, which may limit or impede Schlumberger’s future ability to obtain additional work from those customers.  Failure to retain key employees and skilled workers could adversely affect Schlumberger following the merger.  Schlumberger’s performance following the merger could be adversely affected if the combined company is unable to retain certain key employees and skilled workers of Smith. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees and skilled workers could adversely affect Schlumberger’s future operating results because of their experience and knowledge of Smith’s business. In addition, current and prospective employees of Schlumberger and Smith may experience uncertainty about their future roles with their company until after the merger is completed. This may adversely affect the ability of both Schlumberger and Smith to attract and retain key personnel.  The required regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may contain materially burdensome conditions that could have an adverse effect on Schlumberger.  Completion of the pending merger is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the issuance by the European Commission of a decision under the EC Merger Regulation declaring the merger compatible with the common market and the approval of the merger by the antitrust regulators in other specified jurisdictions. Although Schlumberger and Smith have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals, there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained. In addition, the governmental authorities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Schlumberger is required to agree to take all actions    28    Table of Contents  demanded by an antitrust regulator in order to resolve any objections to the merger (including divestitures, hold-separate restrictions or other restrictions) if doing so would not exceed a specified threshold, which is referred to as the detriment limit. The detriment limit would be exceeded if the required divestitures or hold-separate restrictions affect assets other than (1) the W-H Energy Services business and corresponding Schlumberger operations and (2) other assets accounting for Schlumberger or Smith revenues of not more than $190 million in 2009, excluding from such calculation any W-H Energy Services operations and Smith’s Wilson business unit. If Schlumberger agrees to undertake divestitures or comply with operating restrictions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the merger, Schlumberger may be less able to realize anticipated benefits of the merger, and the business and results of operations of the combined company after the merger may be adversely affected.  A significant portion of the combined company’s revenue will be dependent on the activity level of natural gas exploration and production in North America.  Upon consummation of the merger, a larger portion of our revenues will be derived from our North American operations. Because of the current economic environment and related decrease in demand for energy, natural gas exploration and production in North America have decreased significantly from their peak levels in the summer of 2008. Warmer than normal winters in North America, among other factors, may adversely impact demand for natural gas and, therefore, demand for oilfield services. If the economic conditions deteriorate further or do not improve, the decline in natural gas exploration and production could cause a decline in the demand for the services and products of the combined company. Such decline could result in a significant adverse effect on our operating results.  The market value of Schlumberger common stock could decline if large amounts of its common stock are sold following the merger.  Following the merger, stockholders of Schlumberger and former stockholders of Smith will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. Current stockholders of Schlumberger and Smith may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company, or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company, in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines, to increase diversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which Schlumberger or Smith common stock is included. If, following the merger, large amounts of Schlumberger common stock are sold, the price of its common stock could decline.  The merger may be dilutive to Schlumberger’s earnings per share in the near term, which may negatively affect the market price of Schlumberger common stock.  The merger may be dilutive to earnings per share in the near term. Future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including:        •    adverse changes in energy market conditions;        •    commodity prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;        •    production levels;        •    reserve levels;        •    operating results;        •    competitive conditions;        •    laws and regulations affecting the energy business;        •    capital expenditure obligations; and        •    general economic conditions.    29    Table of Contents Any dilution of, or decrease or delay of any accretion to, Schlumberger’s earnings per share could cause the price of Schlumberger’s common stock to decline.  Demand for our products and services could be reduced or eliminated by governmental regulation or a change in the law.  International, national, and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and promulgating climate-related legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is taking steps to require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions and to regulate GHGs as pollutants under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). The EPA’s “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” rule established a comprehensive scheme of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions that began in 2010. Furthermore, the EPA recently proposed additional GHG reporting rules specifically for the oil and gas industry. The EPA has also published a final rule, the “Endangerment Finding”, finding that GHGs in the atmosphere endanger public health and welfare, and that emissions of GHGs from mobile sources cause or contribute to the GHG pollution. Following issuance of the Endangerment Finding, the EPA promulgated final motor vehicle GHG emission standards on April 1, 2010. The EPA has asserted that the final motor vehicle GHG emission standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources. In addition, climate change legislation is pending in the United States Congress. These developments may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services and products, which may in turn adversely affect future results of operations. Additionally, legislation to reduce greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on our operations, including payment of additional costs due to carbon emissions. Higher carbon emission activities include transportation, including marine vessels, cement production (by third party suppliers), and electricity generation (by third party suppliers) as well as other activities. Finally, our business could be negatively affected by climate change related physical changes or changes in weather patterns, which could result in damages to or loss of our physical assets, impacts to our ability to conduct operations and/or disruption of our customers’ operations.  Legislation is pending in the United States Congress that would authorize the EPA to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals that could adversely affect drinking water supplies. In addition a number of states are evaluating the adoption of legislation or regulations governing hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations or legislation could reduce demand for pressure pumping services. If federal and/or state legislation or regulations were enacted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are unable to predict whether the proposed legislation, regulations, or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted.      Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
