Item 1A. Risk Factors.  As of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of Schlumberger’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, except as follows:  The ability of Cameron and Schlumberger to complete the merger is subject to the approval of Cameron stockholders, certain closing conditions and the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities which may impose conditions that could adversely affect Cameron or Schlumberger or cause the merger to be abandoned. The merger agreement contains certain closing conditions, including approval of the merger by Cameron stockholders, the absence of injunctions or other legal restrictions and that no material adverse effect shall have occurred with respect to either company. In addition, Cameron and Schlumberger will be unable to complete the merger until the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (“the HSR Act”) and consents and approvals are received from the European Commission and various other governmental entities. Regulatory entities may impose certain requirements or obligations as conditions for their approval. The merger agreement may require Cameron and/or Schlumberger to accept conditions from these regulators that could adversely impact the combined company. If the regulatory clearances are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, then neither Schlumberger nor Cameron will be obligated to complete the merger. We can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the merger. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger. Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact Schlumberger. If the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses and the market price of the common stock of Schlumberger may be adversely affected and Schlumberger would be subject to several risks, including Schlumberger having to pay certain costs relating to the merger and diverting the focus of management from pursuing other opportunities that could be beneficial to Schlumberger, in each case, without realizing any of the benefits which might have resulted had the merger been completed. Multiple lawsuits have been filed against Schlumberger and Cameron challenging the merger with Cameron, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the merger from being completed. Subsequent to the announcement of the merger, four putative class action lawsuits were commenced on behalf of stockholders of Cameron against Cameron, its directors, Schlumberger US, Merger Sub and Schlumberger. Additional lawsuits with similar allegations may be filed. One of the conditions to the closing of the merger is that no law, order, injunction, judgment, decree, ruling or other similar requirement shall be in effect that prohibits the completion of the merger. Accordingly, if any of the plaintiffs is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the completion of the merger, then such injunction may prevent the merger from becoming effective, or delay its becoming effective within the expected time frame. Schlumberger may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, Schlumberger’s ability to combine its business with that of Cameron in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies. However, Schlumberger must successfully combine the businesses of Schlumberger and Cameron in a manner that permits these benefits to be realized. In addition, Schlumberger must achieve the anticipated synergies without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If Schlumberger is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. The combined company could incur substantial expenses related to the merger and the integration of Cameron and Schlumberger. Schlumberger expects that the combined company will incur substantial expenses in connection with the pending merger and the integration of their respective businesses, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems. There are a large number of systems that must be integrated, including information management, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll and benefits, fixed asset and lease administration systems and regulatory compliance. There are a number of factors beyond the control of either Schlumberger or Cameron that could affect the total amount or the timing of all of the expected integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. These expenses  29  could, particularly in the near term, reduce the savings that Schlumberger expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings and revenue enhancements related to the integration of the businesses following the completion of the merger, and accordingly, any anticipated net benefits may not be achieved in the near term or at all. These integration expenses may result in the combined company taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the merger. The pendency of the merger could adversely affect Schlumberger. In connection with the pending merger, some of Schlumberger’s customers may delay or defer purchasing decisions, which could negatively impact revenues, earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the merger is completed. Additionally, Schlumberger has agreed in the merger agreement to refrain from taking certain actions with respect to its business and financial affairs during the pendency of the merger. These restrictions could be in place for an extended period of time if completion of the merger is delayed, and could adversely impact Schlumberger’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Schlumberger’s stockholders will be diluted by the merger. The merger will dilute the ownership position of Schlumberger’s current stockholders. We currently estimate that, upon completion of the merger, Schlumberger’s stockholders before the merger will own approximately 90% of the combined company and former Cameron stockholders will own approximately 10% of the combined company’s outstanding common stock. Following the merger, the combined company may be unable to successfully integrate Cameron’s and Schlumberger’s businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger. The merger involves the combination of two companies that historically have operated and currently operate as independent public companies. The success of Schlumberger’s acquisition of Cameron will depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined company in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies and personnel of the two companies following the completion of the merger. Schlumberger may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. The failure of Schlumberger to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of Cameron or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the merger, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair the operations of Schlumberger. The combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the merger, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration.   Potential issues and difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:          •     the inability to successfully integrate the respective businesses of Cameron and Schlumberger in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the merger, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the merger not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;            •     lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;            •     integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and customer service;            •     potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and            •     performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies’ operations.   Business issues currently faced by one company may be imputed to the operations of the other company. To the extent that either Schlumberger or Cameron currently has or is perceived by customers to have operational challenges, such as on-time performance, safety issues or workforce issues, those challenges may raise concerns by existing customers of the other company following the merger which may limit or impede Schlumberger’s future ability to obtain additional work from those customers. 30  Failure to retain key employees and skilled workers could adversely affect Schlumberger following the merger. Schlumberger’s performance following the merger could be adversely affected if the combined company is unable to retain certain key employees and skilled workers of Cameron. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with Cameron while the merger is pending or with the combined company after the merger is consummated. The loss of the services of one or more of these key employees and skilled workers could adversely affect Schlumberger’s future operating results because of their experience and knowledge of Cameron’s business. In addition, current and prospective employees of Schlumberger and Cameron may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the company until after the merger is completed. This may adversely affect the ability of Schlumberger and Cameron to attract and retain key personnel, which could adversely affect Schlumberger’s performance following the merger. The required regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may contain materially burdensome conditions that could have an adverse effect on Schlumberger. Completion of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental approvals, including, without limitation, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, the issuance by the European Commission of a decision under the EC Merger Regulation declaring the merger compatible with the common market and the approval of the merger by the antitrust regulators in other specified jurisdictions. Although Schlumberger and Cameron have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals, there can be no assurance that these approvals will be obtained. In addition, the governmental authorities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Schlumberger has the right, but not the obligation, to oppose or refuse to consent, through litigation or otherwise, to any request, attempt or demand by any governmental entity or other person for any divestiture, hold separate condition or any other restriction with respect to any assets, businesses or product lines of Schlumberger, Cameron or any of their respective subsidiaries and has the obligation to defend any litigation instituted by a governmental entity or other person with respect to the legality of the merger under applicable regulatory laws If Schlumberger agrees to undertake divestitures or comply with operating restrictions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the merger, Schlumberger may be less able to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, and the business and results of operations of the combined company after the merger may be adversely affected. The market value of Schlumberger common stock could decline if large amounts of its common stock are sold following the merger. Following the merger, stockholders of Schlumberger and former stockholders of Cameron will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. Current stockholders of Schlumberger and Cameron may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company, or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company, in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines, to increase diversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which Schlumberger or Cameron common stock is included. If, following the merger, large amounts of Schlumberger common stock are sold, the price of its common stock could decline. The merger may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to Schlumberger’s earnings per share in the near term, which may negatively affect the market price of Schlumberger common stock. Schlumberger anticipates that the merger will be accretive to earnings per share by the end of the first year after closing. However, the merger may be dilutive to earnings per share in the near term. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than is currently expected, including:          •     adverse changes in energy market conditions;            •     commodity prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;            •     operating results;            •     competitive conditions;            •     laws and regulations affecting the energy business;   31           •     capital expenditure obligations; and            •     general economic conditions.   Any dilution of, or decrease or delay of any accretion to, Schlumberger’s earnings per share could cause the price of Schlumberger’s common stock to decline. Item 2.
