QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInformation about market risks for the six months ended June 30, 2013, does not differ materially from that discussed under Item 7A in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of June 30, 2013, with the participation of management, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Act, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were operating effectively as of June 30, 2013.There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act, in the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.PART II. OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSThe following is a description of reportable legal proceedings, including those involving governmental authorities under federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, for this reporting period. The information below includes material developments with respect to matters previously reported in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K or the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2013. There were no new matters that arose during the second quarter of 2013. While it is not possible to accurately predict the final outcome of these pending proceedings, if any one or more of such proceedings were decided adversely to Phillips 66, we expect there would be no material effect on our consolidated financial position. Nevertheless, such proceedings are reported pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulations.Our U.S. refineries are implementing two separate consent decrees, regarding alleged violations of the Federal Clean Air Act, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), six states and one local air pollution agency. Some of the requirements and limitations contained in the decrees provide for stipulated penalties for violations. Stipulated penalties under the decrees are not automatic, but must be requested by one of the agency signatories. As part of periodic reports under the decrees or other reports required by permits or regulations, we occasionally report matters that could be subject to a request for stipulated penalties. If a specific request for stipulated penalties meeting the reporting threshold set forth in SEC rules is made pursuant to these decrees based on a given reported exceedance, we will separately report that matter and the amount of the proposed penalty.Matters Previously ReportedPhillips 66 was one of several companies that entered into Administrative Settlement Agreements (ASA) with the EPA to settle allegations that it had used invalid Renewable Identification Numbers for its 2010 and 2011 fuel program compliance. Under the ASA, Phillips 66 previously paid a penalty of $250,000 and in June 2013, upon demand from the EPA, we paid a final penalty of $100,000. This matter is now resolved.Item 1A.
