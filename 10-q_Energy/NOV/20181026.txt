Item 1A. Risk Factors. If, however, such insurance was inapplicable or insufficient to cover such losses, there could be material negative impacts to our business. The Company is also a party to claims, threatened and actual litigation, governmental regulatory proceedings and private arbitration arising from ordinary day to day business activities, in which parties assert claims against the Company for a broad spectrum of potential liabilities, including: individual employment law claims, collective actions under federal employment laws, intellectual property claims, e.g., alleged patent infringement, and/or misappropriation of trade secrets, premises liability claims, personal injuries arising from allegedly defective products, alleged breach of warranty, improper payments under anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and other commercial claims seeking recovery for alleged actual or exemplary damages. In currently pending litigation and arbitrations, adverse parties have asserted damages in material amounts for which they seek recovery from the Company. Due to the inherent risks and uncertainty of litigation, an unexpected adverse result may occur from time to time. For many such contingent claims, the Company’s insurance coverage is inapplicable or an exclusion to coverage may apply. In such instances, settlement or other resolution of such contingent claims could have a material financial or reputational impact on the Company. As of September 30, 2018, the Company recorded reserves in an amount believed to be sufficient for contingent liabilities representing all contingencies believed to be probable to cover such liabilities. The Company has also assessed the potential for additional losses above the amounts accrued as well as potential losses for matters that are not probable but are reasonably possible. The total potential loss on these matters cannot be determined; however, in our opinion, any ultimate liability, to the extent not otherwise provided for and except for the specific cases referred to above, will not materially affect our financial position, cash flow or results of operations. These estimated liabilities are based on the Company’s assessment of the nature of these matters, their progress toward resolution, the advice of legal counsel and outside experts as well as management’s intention and experience.  17    Further, in some instances, direct or indirect consumers of our products and services, entities providing financing for purchases of our products and services or members of the supply chain for our products and services have become involved in governmental investigations, internal investigations, political or other enforcement matters. In such circumstances, such investigations may adversely impact the ability of consumers of our products, entities providing financial support to such consumers or entities in the supply chain to timely perform their business plans or to timely perform under agreements with us. We may also become involved in these investigations, at substantial cost to the Company.      14.  New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-07 “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (ASU 2017-07). This update requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs and separately from other components of net benefit cost. ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018 with no material impact.  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-15 “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (ASU 2016-15). This update amends Accounting Standard Codification Topic No. 230 “Statement of Cash Flows” and provides guidance and clarification on presentation of certain cash flow issues. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018 with no material impact. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU proscribes a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach, in which an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment was made to retained earnings. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows as of the adoption date or for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. See Note 6 for additional details of the Company’s revenue recognition policies.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-12 “Derivatives and Hedging – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (ASU 2017-12). This update improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships and simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period after issuance of ASU 2017-12. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (ASC Topic 842), which supersedes the lease requirements in ASC Topic No. 840 “Leases” and most industry-specific guidance. This update increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASC Topic 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company’s internal team, assisted by a top-tier accounting and consulting firm, has implemented and is testing new software, processes, procedures and controls to correctly account for leases under the new requirements. We currently estimate implementing ASC Topic 842 in the first quarter of 2019 will gross-up the Company’s balance sheet with additional assets and liabilities in the range of approximately $500 to $750 million. Implementing the new standard will not affect the Company’s compliance with the debt-to-capitalization covenant of our $3 billion revolving credit facility (see Note 7) because that agreement grandfathers the prior treatment of operating leases for purposes of the calculation.    18    Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Introduction  National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  In our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we identified our most critical accounting policies. In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition (See Note 6); allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairment of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets); goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets; purchase price allocation of acquisitions; warranties; and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  For the third quarter ended September 30, 2018, the Company generated net income of $1 million, compared to net income of $24 million in the second quarter of 2018 and a net loss of $26 million in the third quarter of 2017.  Operating profit for the third quarter of 2018 was $73 million, or 3.4 percent of sales, compared to operating profit of $52 million in the second quarter of 2018 and an operating loss of $7 million in the third quarter of 2017. Third quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $245 million, compared to $226 million in the second quarter of 2018 and $167 million in the third quarter of 2017. Oil & Gas Equipment and Services Market Technological advancements in oilfield equipment and services unlocked production from previously uneconomic formations which, combined with high commodity demand and prices, enabled and sustained an increase in global drilling activity that dramatically grew oil supplies from 2004 to 2014. Global supply started to catch up to demand, and, in the second half of 2014, demand growth in areas such as Asia, Europe and the U.S. weakened while drilling activity remained strong and production continued to grow. As a result, inventories of crude and refined products increased, and the price of oil declined significantly during early 2015, remained depressed throughout the year and fell further toward the end of 2015. In early 2016, the market witnessed oil trading in the high $20 per barrel range, prices not seen since 2003.  The Company aggressively sized its operations to the market and reduced annual expenses relating to salaries, wages, outside services, contractors, travel and entertainment by approximately $3.0 billion, while continuing to invest in developing and acquiring new products, technologies and operations that advance the Company’s longer term strategic goals. The Company believes that sharp spending reductions by customers has created pent up demand for its products and services and NOV is well positioned to cost-effectively ramp operations to capitalize on market improvements. The Company has successfully pivoted towards the industry’s increased focus on onshore unconventional developments, while strategically maintaining a leading position in offshore equipment. The market downturn began to stabilize during the second half of 2016. Through 2017 and into the first nine months of 2018, drilling activity increased for North America land, stabilized in international land markets, and remained depressed offshore. Well completion work increased as the market recovered but then fell in September of 2018. The average price of West Texas Intermediate Cushing Crude for the third quarter of 2018 was $69.76 a barrel.  NOV’s global customer base includes national oil companies, international oil companies, independent oil and gas companies, onshore and offshore drilling contractors and service companies and others whose strategies and reactions to low or volatile commodity prices vary. Likewise, the Company expects the timing and slope of revenue stabilization and recovery will be different across its operating regions and its three business segments. NOV’s Wellbore Technologies segment and certain elements of its Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technologies segments are realizing a faster recovery as drilling of new wells increases, while a strong recovery for certain of its more capital equipment-oriented businesses are expected to come later in the cycle.  20    Segment Performance Wellbore Technologies Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $847 million in the third quarter of 2018, an increase of seven percent from the second quarter of 2018 and an increase of 22 percent from the third quarter of 2017. The segment realized meaningful growth for the second consecutive quarter as revenue outpaced rig-count growth in the U.S. and international operations capitalized on an increasing number of opportunities associated with the emerging recovery in the Eastern Hemisphere. Operating leverage was limited to four percent mostly due to higher steel and labor costs, which outpaced the segment’s price increases. Operating profit was $40 million, or 4.7 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA increased two percent sequentially and 44 percent from the prior year to $135 million, or 15.9 percent of sales. Completion & Production Solutions Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $735 million in the third quarter of 2018, a decrease of $3 million from the second quarter of 2018 and an increase of eight percent from the third quarter of 2017. Growing global demand for land production equipment was offset by offshore capital equipment businesses that have not yet bottomed and a pullback in demand for well-simulation equipment in North America. Operating profit was $46 million or 6.3 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA increased five percent sequentially and two percent from the prior year to $99 million, or 13.5 percent of sales. Backlog for capital equipment orders for Completion & Production Solutions at September 30, 2018 was $880 million. New orders booked during the quarter were $372 million, representing a book-to-bill of 85 percent when compared to the $439 million of orders shipped from backlog. Rig Technologies Rig Technologies generated revenues of $637 million in the third quarter of 2018, a decrease of two percent from the second quarter of 2018 and an increase of 25 percent from the third quarter of 2017. Improving aftermarket sales and better progress on offshore projects did not fully offset lower land rig sales from inventory. Operating profit was $58 million, or 9.1 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA decreased seven percent sequentially and increased 95 percent from the prior year to $78 million, or 12.2 percent of sales.  At September 30, 2018, backlog for capital equipment orders for Rig Technologies was $3.40 billion. New orders booked during the quarter totaled $151 million, representing a book-to-bill of 59 percent when compared to the $256 million of orders shipped from backlog.  Outlook  While North America land drilling has increased, working rig-counts remain well below prior cyclical highs. International land drilling, which had been slower to fall than North American activity, may have reached the bottom of its cycle during 2017, and is showing some signs of recovery. Offshore activity, which has longer project cycle times, showed leading indicators of renewed investment during Q3, and may improve into 2019. Near-term, the Company anticipates that land drilling customers will continue to increase spending on NOV’s equipment and services and North American pressure pumping customers will proceed slower in the face of lower well stimulation day rates. The Company remains optimistic regarding longer-term market fundamentals as existing oil and gas fields continue to deplete and numerous major projects to replenish supply have been deferred or canceled while global demand continues to grow. NOV expects unconventional resources will continue to gain a greater share of global production, and the Company will continue to enhance its unconventional resource focused products and technologies, including advanced, automated drilling rigs; premium drillpipe and directional drilling technologies; hydraulic fracture stimulation equipment; and multistage completion tools. NOV expects big data and predictive analytics to improve uptime and operating efficiency, and the Company remains at the forefront of applying this promising technology to oilfield drilling and completion equipment. NOV expects the oil and gas industry to adopt more efficient supply chain practices that the Company is pioneering to construct floating production facilities to produce the immense resources discovered offshore. The Company has used the recent downturn to vigorously advance these strategic initiatives and is encouraged by its progress.  21    Operating Environment Overview The Company’s results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the prices of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, and worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key industry indicators for the third quarter of 2018 and 2017, and the second quarter of 2018 include the following:                                                %        %                                                 3Q18        3Q18             3Q18*        3Q17*        2Q18*        3Q17        2Q18       Active Drilling Rigs:                                                                U.S.        1,051           947           1,037           11.0  %        1.4  %    Canada        208           208           105           0.0  %        98.1  %    International        1,003           947           968           5.9  %        3.6  %    Worldwide        2,262           2,102           2,110           7.6  %        7.2  %                                                                     West Texas Intermediate  Crude Prices (per barrel)     $  69.76        $  48.15        $  68.03           44.9  %        2.5  %                                                                     Natural Gas Prices ($/mmbtu)     $  2.90        $  2.93        $  2.82           (1.0  %)        2.8  %         *  Averages for the quarters indicated.

Revenue from Wellbore Technologies was $847 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $693 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $154 million or 22 percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenue from Wellbore Technologies was $2,351 million compared to $1,862 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2017, an increase of $489 million or 26 percent. Operating profit from Wellbore Technologies was $40 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $40 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, operating profit from Wellbore Technologies was $90 million compared to an operating loss of $81 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2017, an increase of $171 million. Operating profit (loss) percentage increased to 3.8 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from (4.4) percent in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the ongoing U.S. recovery.  Completion & Production Solutions Three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Revenue from Completion & Production Solutions was $735 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $682 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, an increase of  23    $53 million or eight percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenue from Completion & Production Solutions was $2,143 million compared to $1,982 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2017, an increase of $161 million or eight percent.  Operating profit from Completion & Production Solutions was $46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $44 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $2 million or five percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, operating profit from Completion and Production Solutions was $102 million compared to $79 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2017, an increase of $23 million. Operating profit percentage increased to 4.8 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from 4.0 percent in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Improved demand for capital equipment in North America and an increase in deliveries of composite pipe more than offset lower demand for offshore products. The Completion & Productions Solutions segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major completion and production components or a contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $880 million at September 30, 2018, a decrease of $94 million, or ten percent from backlog of $974 million at September 30, 2017. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these factors, the Company reasonably expects approximately $437 million of revenue out of backlog for the remainder of 2018 and approximately $443 million of revenue out of backlog in 2019 and thereafter. At September 30, 2018, approximately 59 percent of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 68 percent of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets. Rig Technologies Three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Revenue from Rig Technologies was $637 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $510 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $127 million or 25 percent. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, revenue from Rig Technologies was $1,771 million compared to $1,638 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2017, an increase of $133 million or eight percent. Operating profit from Rig Technologies was $58 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, an increase of $40 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2018, operating profit from Rig Technologies was $138 million compared to $37 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2017, an increase of $101 million. Operating profit percentage increased to 7.8 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, from 2.3 percent in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was the result of improving aftermarket sales, partially offset by lower rig equipment sales and slowed progress on the construction of offshore newbuild drilling rigs. The Rig Technologies segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $3.40 billion at September 30, 2018, an increase of $1.39 billion, or 69 percent, from backlog of $2.01 billion at September 30, 2017. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these factors, the Company reasonably expects approximately $282 million of revenue out of backlog for the remainder of 2018 and approximately $3.1 billion of revenue out of backlog in 2019 and thereafter. At September 30, 2018, approximately 33 percent of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 89 percent of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.  Eliminations and corporate costs Eliminations and corporate costs were $71 million and $206 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $69 million and $201 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. This change is primarily due to the change in intersegment eliminations. Sales from one segment to another generally are priced at estimated equivalent commercial selling prices; however, segments originating an external sale are credited with the full profit to the company. Eliminations include intercompany transactions conducted between the three reporting segments that are eliminated in consolidation. Intrasegment transactions are eliminated within each segment.  Other income (expense), net  Other income (expense), net were expenses of $20 million and $70 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to expenses of $16 million and $36 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. The change in expense was primarily due to the fluctuations in foreign currencies.  24    Provision for income taxes  The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 were $29 million and $37 million, respectively, compared to ($13 million) and ($43 million) for the same periods in 2017. The Company established valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for losses and tax credits generated in each period which resulted in a corresponding tax charge. The change in tax provision (benefit) from 2017 to 2018 was also impacted by the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018. 25    Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations  The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA (defined as Operating Profit excluding Depreciation, Amortization and, when applicable, Other Items) in its periodic earnings press releases and other public disclosures to provide investors additional information about the results of ongoing operations. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate and manage the business. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace GAAP financial measures, such as Net Income. Other items in 2018 consisted primarily of the reversal of certain accruals, partially offset by restructure charges and severance payments.  The following tables set forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions):             Three Months Ended        Nine Months Ended             September 30,        June 30        September 30,             2018        2017        2018        2018        2017       Operating profit (loss):                                                                Wellbore Technologies     $  40        $  —        $  38        $  90        $  (81  )    Completion & Production Solutions        46           44           40           102           79       Rig Technologies        58           18           62           138           37       Eliminations and corporate costs        (71  )        (69  )        (88  )        (206  )        (201  )    Total operating profit (loss)     $  73        $  (7  )     $  52        $  124        $  (166  )                                                                     Other items:                                                                Wellbore Technologies     $  —        $  —        $  —        $  (3  )     $  (4  )    Completion & Production Solutions        —           —           —           3           32       Rig Technologies        —           —           —           6           29       Corporate        —           —           —           (18  )        —       Total other items     $  —        $  —        $  —        $  (12  )     $  57                                                                        Depreciation & amortization:                                                                Wellbore Technologies     $  95        $  94        $  95        $  284        $  283       Completion & Production Solutions        53           53           54           161           161       Rig Technologies        20           22           22           63           67       Corporate        4           5           3           11           12       Total depreciation & amortization     $  172        $  174        $  174        $  519        $  523                                                                        Adjusted EBITDA:                                                                Wellbore Technologies     $  135        $  94        $  133        $  371        $  198       Completion & Production Solutions        99           97           94           266           272       Rig Technologies        78           40           84           207           133       Eliminations and corporate costs        (67  )        (64  )        (85  )        (213  )        (189  )    Total adjusted EBITDA     $  245        $  167        $  226        $  631        $  414                                                                        Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA:                                                                GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Company     $  1        $  (26  )     $  24        $  (43  )     $  (223  )    Noncontrolling interests        3           (1  )        1           6           2       Provision (benefit) for income taxes        29           (13  )        5           37           (43  )    Interest expense        24           26           23           71           77       Interest income        (6  )        (11  )        (5  )        (18  )        (19  )    Equity (income) loss in unconsolidated affiliate        2           2           1           1           4       Other (income) expense, net        20           16           3           70           36       Depreciation and amortization        172           174           174           519           523       Other items        —           —           —           (12  )        57       Total Adjusted EBITDA     $  245        $  167        $  226        $  631        $  414      26      Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview  The Company assesses liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. The Company remains in a strong financial position, with resources available to reinvest in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to meet short- and long-term objectives. The Company believes that cash on hand, cash generated from expected results of operations, amounts available under its credit facility and its commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, anticipated working capital needs and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures, debt and interest payments and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.  At September 30, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,293 million and total debt of $2,714 million. At December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $1,437 million and total debt was $2,712 million. As of September 30, 2018, approximately $936 million of the $1,293 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries and the earnings associated with this cash were subject to U.S. taxation under the Act defined in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If opportunities to invest in the U.S. are greater than available cash balances that are not subject to income tax, rather than repatriating cash, the Company may choose to borrow against its revolving credit facility or utilize its commercial paper program. The Company’s outstanding debt at September 30, 2018 was $2,714 million and consisted of $1,394 million in 2.60% Senior Notes, $1,088 million in 3.95% Senior Notes, and other debt of $232 million. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2018.  At September 30, 2018, there were no commercial paper borrowings, and there were no outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility, resulting in $3.0 billion of funds available under this credit facility.  The Company had $471 million of outstanding letters of credit at September 30, 2018, primarily in the U.S. and Norway, that are under various bilateral letter of credit facilities. Letters of credit are issued as bid bonds, advanced payment bonds and performance bonds. The following table summarizes our net cash provided by continuing operating activities, continuing investing activities and continuing financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):              Nine Months Ended             September 30,             2018        2017       Net cash provided by operating activities     $  300        $  511       Net cash used in investing activities        (392  )        (184  )    Net cash used in financing activities        (12  )        (52  )     Operating Activities For the first nine months of 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $300 million compared to $511 million in the same period of 2017. Before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was provided primarily by net loss from operations of $37 million plus non-cash charges of $664 million.  The change in operating assets and liabilities in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to declines in inventory and contract assets. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, used $327 million of cash for the first nine months of 2018 compared to cash provided of $48 million in the same period in 2017. From time to time, we participate in factoring arrangements to sell accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions. In the first nine months of 2018, we sold accounts receivable of $248 million at a cost of approximately $2 million, receiving cash proceeds totaling $246 million. Our factoring transactions in the first nine months of 2018 were recognized as sales, and the proceeds are included as operating cash flows in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 27    Investing Activities For the first nine months of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $392 million compared to $184 million for the same period of 2017. Net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of capital expenditures and acquisition activity. The Company used $280 million during the first nine months of 2018 for acquisitions compared to $85 million for the same period of 2017 and $173 million for capital expenditures in the first nine months of 2018 compared to $127 million for the same period of 2017.  Financing Activities For the first nine months of 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $12 million compared to $52 million for the same period of 2017. This decrease was primarily the result of activity under stock incentive plans providing $51 million of cash in 2018 compared to $11 million in 2017. Dividends paid were $57 million for each of the first nine months of 2018 and 2017. Other The effect of the change in exchange rates on cash flows was a decrease of $40 million and an increase of $39 million for the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.  We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividends and financing obligations. We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We continue to expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the revolving credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us.  New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-07 “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (ASU 2017-07). This update requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs and separately from other components of net benefit cost. ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018 with no material impact.  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-15 “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (ASU 2016-15). This update amends Accounting Standard Codification Topic No. 230 “Statement of Cash Flows” and provides guidance and clarification on presentation of certain cash flow issues. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018 with no material impact. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU proscribes a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach, in which an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment was made to retained earnings. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows as of the adoption date or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018. See Note 6 for additional details of the Company’s revenue recognition policies.  28    Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-12 “Derivatives and Hedging – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (ASU 2017-12). This update improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships and simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period after issuance of ASU 2017-12. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (ASC Topic 842), which supersedes the lease requirements in ASC Topic No. 840 “Leases” and most industry-specific guidance. This update increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASC Topic 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company’s internal team, assisted by a top-tier accounting and consulting firm, has implemented and is testing new software, processes, procedures and controls to correctly account for leases under the new requirements. We currently estimate implementing ASC Topic 842 in the first quarter of 2019 will gross-up the Company’s balance sheet with additional assets and liabilities in the range of approximately $500 to $750 million. Implementing the new standard will not affect the Company’s compliance with the debt-to-capitalization covenant of our $3 billion revolving credit facility (see Note 7) because that agreement grandfathers the prior treatment of operating leases for purposes of the calculation. Forward-Looking Statements  Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as “may,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. All statements herein regarding expected merger synergies are forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products, difficulties encountered in integrating mergers and acquisitions, and worldwide economic activity. You should also consider carefully the statements under “Risk Factors,” as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.    29        Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additional information concerning each of these matters follows:  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  We have extensive operations in foreign countries. The net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency. These operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. We recorded a foreign exchange loss in our income statement of approximately $30 million in the first nine months of 2018, compared to approximately $4 million in foreign exchange gain in the same period of the prior year. The gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency.  Some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly, some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate that risk, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.  30    The following table details the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts grouped by functional currency

(3  )        3           3           4           22        The Company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies for transactional exposures totaling $53 million and translation exposures totaling $138 million as of September 30, 2018 excluding trade receivables and  34    payables, which approximate fair value. These market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10 percent movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on the transactional exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by $3 million and the translational exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect the future fair value by $14 million. The counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential.  Interest Rate Risk At September 30, 2018, long term borrowings consisted $1,394 million in 2.60% Senior Notes and $1,088 million in 3.95% Senior Notes. At September 30, 2018, there were no commercial paper borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility, resulting in $3.0 billion of funds available under this credit facility. Occasionally a portion of borrowings under our credit facility could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements. These instruments carry interest at a pre-agreed upon percentage point spread from either LIBOR, NIBOR or CDOR, or at the U.S. prime rate. Under our credit facility, we may, at our option, fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over LIBOR, NIBOR or CDOR for 30 days to six months. Our objective is to maintain a portion of our debt in variable rate borrowings for the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed-rate borrowings.     Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at a reasonable assurance level.  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   35    PART II - OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1A.
