Item 1A. Risk Factors.  The Company is also a party to claims, threatened and actual litigation, and private arbitration arising from ordinary day to day business activities, in which parties assert claims against the Company for a broad spectrum of potential liabilities, including: individual employment law claims, collective actions under federal employment laws, intellectual property claims, including alleged patent infringement, and/or misappropriation of trade secrets, premises liability claims, personal injuries arising from allegedly defective products, alleged improper payments under anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and other commercial claims seeking recovery for alleged actual or exemplary damages. From time to time, in litigation adverse parties assert claims for large damages as a tactic to assert leverage to pressure the Company to pay to settle such claims. The Company staunchly resists such litigation tactics. Due to the inherent risks and uncertainty of litigation, an unexpected adverse result may occur from time to time. For many such contingent claims, the Company’s insurance coverage is inapplicable or an exclusion to coverage may apply. In such instances, settlement or other resolution of such contingent claims could have a material financial or reputational impact on the Company.  As of March 31, 2018, the Company recorded reserves in an amount believed to be sufficient for contingent liabilities representing all contingencies believed to be probable to cover liabilities. The Company has also assessed the potential for additional losses above the amounts accrued as well as potential losses for matters that are not probable but are reasonably possible. The total potential loss on these matters cannot be determined; however, in our opinion, any ultimate liability, to the extent not otherwise provided for and except for the specific cases referred to above, will not materially affect our financial position, cash flow or results of operations. These estimated liabilities are based on the Company’s assessment of the nature of these matters, their progress toward resolution, the advice of legal counsel and outside experts as well as management’s intention and experience.  Further, in some instances, direct or indirect consumers of our products and services, entities providing financing for purchases of our products and services or members of the supply chain for our products and services have become involved in governmental investigations, internal investigations, political or other enforcement matters. In such circumstances, such investigations may adversely impact the ability of consumers of our products, entities providing financial support to such consumers or entities in the supply chain to timely perform their business plans or to timely perform under agreements with us. We may also become involved in these investigations, at substantial cost to the Company.    20      14. New Accounting Pronouncements  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-07 “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (ASU 2017-07). This update requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs and separately from other components of net benefit cost. ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018 with no material impact.  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-15 “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (ASU 2016-15). This update amends Accounting Standard Codification Topic No. 230 “Statement of Cash Flows” and provides guidance and clarification on presentation of certain cash flow issues. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018 with no material impact.  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU proscribes a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach, in which an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment was made to retained earnings. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows as of the adoption date or for the three months ended March 31, 2018. See Note 6 for additional details of the adoption of this standard.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-12 “Derivatives and Hedging – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (ASU 2017-12). This update improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships and simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period after issuance of ASU 2017-12. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (ASC Topic 842), which supersedes the lease requirements in ASC Topic No. 840 “Leases” and most industry-specific guidance. This update increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASC Topic 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  In preparing for the adoption of this new standard, the Company has established an internal team to centralize the implementation process as well as engaged external resources to assist in our approach. We are currently utilizing a software program to consolidate and accumulate leases with documentation as required by the new standard. We have assessed the changes to the Company’s current accounting practices and are investigating the related tax impact and process changes. We are also in process of quantifying the impact of the new standard on our balance sheet.    21      Item 2.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements in order for them to conform with the 2018 presentation. The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA (defined as Operating Profit excluding Depreciation, Amortization and Other Items) in its periodic earnings press releases and other public disclosures to provide investors additional information about the results of ongoing operations. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations in Results of Operations for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to their corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Wellbore Technologies  The Company’s Wellbore Technologies segment designs, manufactures, rents, and sells a variety of equipment and technologies used to perform drilling operations, and offers services that optimize their performance, including: solids control and waste management equipment and services; drilling fluids; portable power generation; premium drill pipe; wired pipe; drilling optimization and automation services; tubular inspection, repair and coating services; rope access inspection; instrumentation; measuring and monitoring; downhole and fishing tools; steerable technologies; hole openers; and drill bits.  Wellbore Technologies focuses on oil and gas companies and supports drilling contractors, oilfield service companies, and oilfield equipment rental companies. Demand for the segment’s products and services depends on the level of oilfield drilling activity by oil and gas companies, drilling contractors, and oilfield service companies.  Completion & Production Solutions  The Company’s Completion & Production Solutions segment integrates technologies for well completions and oil and gas production. The segment designs, manufactures, and sells equipment and technologies needed for hydraulic fracture stimulation, including pressure pumping trucks, blenders, sanders, hydration units, injection units, flowline, and manifolds; well intervention, including coiled tubing units, coiled tubing, and wireline units and tools; onshore production, including composite pipe, surface transfer and progressive cavity pumps, and artificial lift systems; and, offshore production, including floating production systems and subsea production technologies.  Completion & Production Solutions supports service companies and oil and gas companies. Demand for the segment’s products depends on the level of oilfield completions and workover activity by oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, and capital spending plans by oil and gas companies and oilfield service companies.  Rig Technologies  The Company’s Rig Technologies segment makes and supports the capital equipment and integrated systems needed to drill oil and gas wells on land and offshore.

Rig Technologies supports land and offshore drillers. Demand for the segment’s products depends on drilling contractors’ and oil and gas companies’ capital spending plans, specifically capital expenditures on rig construction and refurbishment; and secondarily on the overall level of oilfield drilling activity, which drives demand for spare parts, service, and repair for the segment’s large installed base of equipment.    22    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  In our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, we identified our most critical accounting policies. In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition (See Note 6 for new accounting policy on revenue recognition); allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairment of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets); goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets; purchase price allocation of acquisitions; service and product warranties; and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material.    23    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  For its first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company had a $68 million net loss, or $0.18 per fully diluted share, on $1.8 billion in revenue. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue decreased $174 million or 9% and net loss increased $54 million or 386%. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, revenue increased $54 million or 3%, and net loss decreased $54 million or 44%.  Operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1 million, or (0.1)% of sales, compared to an operating loss of $111 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $97 million in the first quarter of 2017.  During the first quarter of 2018, fourth quarter of 2017, and first quarter of 2017, pre-tax other items (severance, facility closures, reversals of certain reserves and accruals, and other) were a credit of $12 million, and expenses of $133 million and $27 million, respectively. Excluding the other items from all periods, first quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA was $160 million, compared to $197 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $105 million in the first quarter of 2017.  Oil & Gas Equipment and Services Market  Over the past decade, technological advancements in the oilfield equipment and service space unlocked production from formations that were previously deemed uneconomic, especially in North America. From 2004 to 2014 global oil and liquids supply increased dramatically from U.S. unconventional resources, deep-water (defined as water depths greater than 400 feet) resources and from other sources. The advances in technology combined with relatively high commodity prices caused by growing demand enabled and sustained an increase in global drilling activity. Global supply started to catch up to demand, and, in the latter half of 2014, demand growth in areas such as Asia, Europe and the U.S. weakened while drilling activity remained strong and production continued to grow. As a result, global inventories of crude and refined products grew and the price of oil declined significantly during early 2015, remaining depressed throughout the year and undergoing another major reduction toward the end of 2015. In early 2016, the market witnessed oil trading in the high $20 per barrel range, prices not seen since 2003.  In response to rapidly deteriorating market conditions, operators acutely reduced both operating and capital expenditures. Orders for NOV’s equipment and services slowed and rig counts declined rapidly with active U.S. drilling rig counts hitting 70 year lows, and international rig counts reaching decade lows, during the second quarter of 2016. As a result of the sharp cutback in activity, production declined in certain areas of the world, global inventories began to decline and commodity prices started to rebound as oil markets began to re-balance. The market downturn began to stabilize during the second half of 2016 and showed early signs of improvement as the year ended. During 2017 and into the first quarter of 2018, land drilling in North America continued to increase, while international markets stabilized and offshore activity remained depressed. The average price of West Texas Intermediate Cushing Crude for the first quarter of 2018 was $62.88 a barrel.  Segment Performance  Wellbore Technologies  Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $711 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of one percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 28% from the first quarter of 2017. The sequential decrease in revenue was the result of a slow start to the year in the Eastern Hemisphere and a fall-off in drill pipe sales, partially offset by strong growth from the segment’s operations in the Western Hemisphere. Operating profit was $12 million, or 1.7 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $103 million, or 14.5 percent of sales, a decrease of 3.7 percent sequentially and an increase of $65 million from the prior year.  Completion & Production Solutions  Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $670 million, a decrease of three percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of three percent from the first quarter of 2017. Customer deferred deliveries of well servicing and stimulation equipment as well as subsea flexible pipe negatively impacted first quarter revenue conversion. Operating profit was $16 million or 2.4 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $73 million, or 10.9 percent of sales, a decrease of one percent sequentially and a decrease of five percent from the prior year.  Backlog for capital equipment orders for Completion & Production Solutions at March 31, 2018 was $1.01 billion. New orders during the quarter were $324 million, representing a book-to-bill of 84 percent when compared to the $384 million of orders shipped from backlog. The order book included a sizeable order of corrosion-proof fiberglass pipe for a salt-water gathering system and improved bookings for coiled tubing units and pressure pumping equipment.    24    Rig Technologies  Rig Technologies generated revenues of $483 million, a decrease of 21 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 17 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The segment was adversely affected by reduced progress on new offshore rig construction, deferring revenue out of backlog to subsequent quarters. While service and repair contributions were down sequentially, as customers finalized annual budgets, spares revenue continued its recent upward trajectory. Operating profit was $18 million, or 3.7 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $45 million, or 9.3 percent of sales, a decrease of 36 percent sequentially and a decrease of four percent from the prior year.  Backlog for capital equipment orders for Rig Technologies at March 31, 2018 was $2.05 billion. New orders booked during the quarter, which included two land rig packages and several land rig equipment upgrades, totaled $201 million.  Outlook  Activity in North America increased sharply off historical lows during the last two quarters of 2016 and through 2017. Declines in supply appear to have rebalanced the market; however, commodity prices and global activity levels remain relatively low and challenging conditions persist offshore. Consequently, the Company anticipates that its customers will continue to moderate capital expenditures to the extent they remain uncertain of a sustainable recovery in commodity prices.  While North America land drilling has increased, activity levels remain well below prior cyclical highs. International activity, which has been slower to fall than North American activity, may have reached the bottom of its cycle during 2017, though strong signs of recovery are not yet apparent. Offshore activity, which has longer project cycle times and, in certain instances, more challenged economics, may continue to decline for the remainder of 2018.  Low activity levels result in an oversupply of service capacity and capital equipment, creating challenging prospects for many of NOV’s customers and reducing demand for the Company’s products. In this environment, contractors have been hesitant to invest in their existing equipment to conserve as much capital as possible. Equipment has been neglected and idle fleets have been stripped of parts to sustain assets that remain active. Additionally, certain equipment becomes less desirable and obsolete as equipment manufacturers develop new technologies and produce more efficient equipment that improves efficiencies and lowers the marginal cost of supply for oil and gas operating companies. The Company believes that the sharp spending reductions its customers have had in place for an extended period have created pent up demand for NOV’s products that began to show in certain areas during the second half of 2017 as industry activity levels began to improve. Demand slowed during the first quarter of 2018 as protracted customer budgeting cycles deferred deliveries to the second quarter.  NOV’s global customer base includes national oil companies, international oil companies, independent oil and gas companies, onshore and offshore service companies and others whose strategies and reactions to low commodity prices vary. Likewise, the Company expects the timing and slope of revenue stabilization and recovery will be different across its operating regions and its three business segments. NOV’s Wellbore Technologies segment and certain elements of its Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technologies segments are realizing a faster recovery as drilling of new wells increases, while a strong recovery for the more capital equipment oriented businesses are expected to come later in the cycle.  NOV will continue to adjust the size of its operations to fit anticipated levels of activity while investing in developing and acquiring new products, technologies and operations that advance the Company’s longer term strategic goals. NOV has a history of implementing cost-control measures and downsizing in response to depressed market conditions as well as cost effectively ramping operations to capitalize on rapidly increasing demand. The Company has closed, or is in the process of closing, 408 locations over the past three years. It has reduced its annual expenses relating to salaries, wages, outside services, contractors, travel and entertainment by approximately $3.0 billion. The Company remains optimistic regarding longer-term market fundamentals as existing oil and gas fields continue to deplete and numerous major projects to replenish supply have been deferred or canceled while global demand continues to grow.  Though the Company benefited from a high concentration of orders for offshore drilling equipment and services in the preceding years, significant contraction in the offshore market during the recent downturn adversely effected the Company’s performance. Offshore market dynamics and equipment oversupply are expected to cause slower recovery there than in our land business, however, it is in NOV’s strategic interest to maintain a leading position in offshore drilling equipment. The Company has intentionally and successfully pivoted towards onshore and non-drilling related activities in recent years, highly responsive to the industry’s increased focus on onshore unconventional developments. Approximately 65% of consolidated revenues were derived from onshore businesses in 2017, compared to approximately 40% in 2014.  NOV expects unconventional shale resources to continue to gain a greater share of global production, and the Company will continue to enhance its offering into unconventional resource focused products and technologies, including advanced, automated drilling rigs; premium drillpipe and directional drilling technologies; hydraulic fracture stimulation equipment; and multistage completion tools. NOV expects big data and predictive analytics to improve uptime and operating efficiency, and the Company remains at the forefront of applying this promising technology to oilfield drilling and completion equipment. NOV expects the oil and gas industry to adopt more efficient supply chain practices that the Company is pioneering to construct floating production facilities to produce the immense resources discovered offshore. The Company has used the recent downturn to vigorously advance these strategic initiatives, and is encouraged by its progress.    25    Operating Environment Overview  The Company’s results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the prices of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, and worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key industry indicators for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, and the fourth quarter of 2017 include the following:                                1Q18*     1Q17*     4Q17*     %1Q181Q17     %1Q184Q17     Active Drilling Rigs:                            U.S.     965       739       921       30.6 %      4.8 %    Canada     273       299       205       (8.7 %)      33.2 %    International     970       939       948       3.3 %      2.3 %                                                        Worldwide     2,208       1,977       2,074       11.7 %      6.5 %    West Texas IntermediateCrude Prices (per barrel)   $ 62.88     $ 51.77     $ 55.37       21.5 %      13.6 %    Natural Gas Prices ($/mmbtu)   $ 3.04     $ 2.98     $ 2.89       2.0 %      5.2 %       * Averages for the quarters indicated. See sources below.    26    The following table details the U.S., Canadian, and international rig activity and West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil prices for the past nine quarters ended March 31, 2018, on a quarterly basis:       Source: Rig count: Baker Hughes, Inc. (www.bakerhughes.com); West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices: Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (www.eia.doe.gov).  The worldwide quarterly average rig count increased 6.5% (from 2,074 to 2,208), and the U.S. increased 4.8% (from 921 to 965), in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The average per barrel price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil increased 13.6% (from $55.37 per barrel to $62.88 per barrel) and natural gas prices increased 5.2% (from $2.89 per mmbtu to $3.04 per mmbtu) in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.  U.S. rig activity at April 20, 2018 was 1,013 rigs, increasing 5% compared to the first quarter of 2018 average of 965 rigs. The price for West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil was at $68.38 per barrel at April 20, 2018, increasing 9% from the first quarter of 2018 average. The price for natural gas was at $2.74 per mmbtu at April 20, 2018, decreasing 10% from the first quarter of 2018 average.    27    Results of Operations  Operating results by segment are as follows (in millions):                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2018     2017     Revenue:             Wellbore Technologies   $ 711     $ 555     Completion & Production Solutions     670       648     Rig Technologies     483       582     Eliminations     (69 )      (44 )                          Total revenue   $ 1,795     $ 1,741                           Operating profit (loss):             Wellbore Technologies   $ 12     $ (57 )    Completion & Production Solutions     16       8     Rig Technologies     18       13     Eliminations and corporate costs     (47 )      (61 )                          Total operating profit (loss)   $ (1 )    $ (97 )                          Operating profit (loss)%:             Wellbore Technologies     1.7 %      (10.3 %)    Completion & Production Solutions     2.4 %      1.2 %    Rig Technologies     3.7 %      2.2 %    Total operating profit (loss) %     (0.1 %)      (5.6 %)   Wellbore Technologies  Three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Revenue from Wellbore Technologies was $711 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $555 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $156 million or 28%. This increase was due to the strong U.S. recovery.  Operating profit (loss) from Wellbore Technologies was $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $(57) million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $69 million. Operating profit (loss) percentage increased to 1.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from (10.3)% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to the strong U.S. recovery.  Completion & Production Solutions  Three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Revenue from Completion & Production Solutions was $670 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $648 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $22 million or 3%. This increase was due to the overall increase in demand for capital equipment used in completion and production related activities.  Operating profit from Completion & Production Solutions was $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $8 million or 100%. Operating profit percentage increased to 2.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 1.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was due to an overall increase in market activity.  The Completion & Productions Solutions segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major completion and production components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $1,010 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $259 million, or 34% from backlog of $751 million at March 31, 2017. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these factors, the Company reasonably expects approximately $880 million of revenue out of backlog for the remainder of 2018 and approximately $130 million of revenue out of backlog in 2019 and thereafter. At March 31, 2018, approximately 54% of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 72% of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.    28    Rig Technologies  Three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Revenue from Rig Technologies was $483 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $582 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $99 million or 17%. This decrease was due to a declining backlog and challenging market conditions for the Company’s offshore contract drilling customer base.  Operating profit from Rig Technologies was $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $5 million or 38%. Operating profit percentage increased to 3.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from 2.2% in the three months ended March 31, 2017. Operating profit percentage increased due to product mix.  The Rig Technologies segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $2.05 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $275 million, or 12%, from backlog of $2.32 billion at March 31, 2017. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these factors, the Company reasonably expects approximately $750 million of revenue out of backlog for the remainder of 2018 and approximately $1.30 billion of revenue out of backlog in 2019 and thereafter. At March 31, 2018, approximately 77% of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 80% of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.  Eliminations and corporate costs  Eliminations and corporate costs were $47 million and $61 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This change is primarily due to the change in intersegment eliminations. Sales from one segment to another generally are priced at estimated equivalent commercial selling prices; however, segments originating an external sale are credited with the full profit to the company. Eliminations include intercompany transactions conducted between the three reporting segments that are eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions within each reporting segment are eliminated within each reporting segment.  Other income (expense), net  Other income (expense), net were expenses of $(47) million and $(15) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The change in expense was primarily due to the fluctuations in foreign currencies.  Provision for income taxes  The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 was (4.8)% and 9.8%, respectively. The change in effective tax rate was due primarily to the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% in 2017 to 21% in 2018. In addition, the Company established valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for losses and tax credits generated in each year, which, when applied to losses resulted in lower effective tax rates than the U.S. statutory rate.    29    Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations  The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA (defined as Operating Profit excluding Depreciation, Amortization and Other Items) in its periodic earnings press releases and other public disclosures to provide investors additional information about the results of ongoing operations. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate and manage the business. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace GAAP financial measures, such as Net Income. Other items in 2018 consisted primarily of the reversal of certain accruals, partially offset by restructure charges and severance payments. Other items in 2017 consisted primarily of restructure charges for inventory write-downs, facility closures and severance payments.  The following tables set forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions):                        Three Months Ended        March 31,     December 31,        2018     2017     2017     Operating profit (loss):                  Wellbore Technologies   $ 12     $ (57 )    $ (21 )    Completion & Production Solutions     16       8       19     Rig Technologies     18       13       (51 )    Eliminations and corporate costs     (47 )      (61 )      (58 )                                    Total operating profit (loss)   $ (1 )    $ (97 )    $ (111 )                                    Other items:                  Wellbore Technologies   $ (3 )    $ —      $ 32     Completion & Production Solutions     3       15       1     Rig Technologies     6       12       100     Eliminations and corporate costs     (18 )      —        —                                      Total other items   $ (12 )    $ 27     $ 133                                     Depreciation & amortization:                  Wellbore Technologies   $ 94     $ 95     $ 96     Completion & Production Solutions     54       54       54     Rig Technologies     21       22       21     Eliminations and corporate costs     4       4       4                                     Total depreciation & amortization   $ 173     $ 175     $ 175                                     Adjusted EBITDA:                  Wellbore Technologies   $ 103     $ 38     $ 107     Completion & Production Solutions     73       77       74     Rig Technologies     45       47       70     Eliminations and corporate costs     (61 )      (57 )      (54 )                                    Total Adjusted EBITDA   $ 160     $ 105     $ 197                                     Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA:                  GAAP net loss attributable to Company   $ (68 )    $ (122 )    $ (14 )    Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest     2       2       (1 )    Provision for income taxes     3       (13 )      (123 )    Interest expense     24       25       25     Interest income     (7 )      (4 )      (6 )    Equity (income) loss in unconsolidated affiliates     (2 )      —        1     Other (income) expense, net     47       15       7     Depreciation & amortization     173       175       175     Other items in operating profit     (12 )      27       133                                     Total Adjusted EBITDA:   $  160     $ 105     $ 197                                      30    Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview  The Company assesses liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. The Company remains in a strong financial position, with resources available to reinvest in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to meet short- and long-term objectives. The Company believes that cash on hand, cash generated from expected results of operations, amounts available under its credit facility and its commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, anticipated working capital needs and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures, debt and interest payments and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.  At March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,236 million and total debt of $2,713 million. At December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $1,437 million and total debt was $2,712 million. As of March 31, 2018, approximately $971 million of the $1,236 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries and the earnings associated with this cash were subject to U.S. taxation under the Act defined in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If opportunities to invest in the U.S. are greater than available cash balances that are not subject to income tax, rather than repatriating cash, the Company may choose to borrow against its revolving credit facility or utilize its commercial paper program.  The Company’s outstanding debt at March 31, 2018 was $2,713 million and consisted of $1,393 million in 2.60% Senior Notes, $1,088 million in 3.95% Senior Notes, and other debt of $232 million. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2018.  At March 31, 2018, there were no commercial paper borrowings supported by the $3.0 billion credit facility and no outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility, resulting in $3.0 billion of funds available under this credit facility.  The Company had $567 million of outstanding letters of credit at March 31, 2018 that are under various bilateral letter of credit facilities. Letters of credit are issued as bid bonds, advanced payment bonds and performance bonds.  The following table summarizes our net cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities, continuing investing activities and continuing financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2018     2017     Net cash provided (used) by operating activities   $ (129 )    $ 111     Net cash used in investing activities     (61 )      (42 )    Net cash used in financing activities     (18 )      (13 )   Operating Activities  For the first three months of 2018, cash provided (used) by operating activities was $(129) million compared to $111 million in the same period of 2017. Before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was used by operations primarily through a $66 million loss from operations plus non-cash charges of $195 million.  The change in cash used in the first three months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory and a decrease in accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and contract liabilities. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, used $258 million of cash for the first three months of 2018 compared to cash used of $3 million in the same period in 2017.    31    Investing Activities  For the first three months of 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $61 million compared to $42 million for the same period of 2017. Net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of capital expenditures and acquisition activity. The Company used $36 million during the first three months of 2018 for acquisitions compared to $6 million for the same period of 2017 and $39 million for capital expenditures in the first three months of 2018 compared to $42 million for the same period of 2017.  Financing Activities  For the first three months of 2018, net cash used in financing activities was $18 million compared to $13 million for the same period of 2017. This decrease was primarily the result of activity under stock incentive plans providing $3 million of cash in 2018 compared to $9 million in 2017. Dividends paid were $19 million for each of the first three months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Other  The effect of the change in exchange rates on cash flows was an increase of $7 million and $15 million for the first three months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.  We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividends and financing obligations.  We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We continue to expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the revolving credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us.    32    New Accounting Pronouncements  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-07 “Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (ASU 2017-07). This update requires that an employer report the service cost component in the same line item as other compensation costs and separately from other components of net benefit cost. ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018 with no material impact.  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-15 “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (ASU 2016-15). This update amends Accounting Standard Codification Topic No. 230 “Statement of Cash Flows” and provides guidance and clarification on presentation of certain cash flow issues. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018 with no material impact.  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in FASB ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU proscribes a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach, in which an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment was made to retained earnings. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, equity or cash flows as of the adoption date or for the three months ended March 31, 2018. See Note 6 for additional details of the adoption of this standard.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-12 “Derivatives and Hedging – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (ASU 2017-12). This update improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships and simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period after issuance of ASU 2017-12. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-12 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (ASC Topic 842), which supersedes the lease requirements in ASC Topic No. 840 “Leases” and most industry-specific guidance. This update increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASC Topic 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years.  In preparing for the adoption of this new standard, the Company has established an internal team to centralize the implementation process as well as engaged external resources to assist in our approach. We are currently utilizing a software program to consolidate and accumulate leases with documentation as required by the new standard. We have assessed the changes to the Company’s current accounting practices and are investigating the related tax impact and process changes. We are also in process of quantifying the impact of the new standard on our balance sheet.    33    Forward-Looking Statements  Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as “may,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. All statements herein regarding expected merger synergies are forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products, difficulties encountered in integrating mergers and acquisitions, and worldwide economic activity. You should also consider carefully the statements under “Risk Factors,” as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.    34    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additional information concerning each of these matters follows:  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  We have extensive operations in foreign countries. The net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency. These operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. We recorded a foreign exchange loss in our income statement of approximately $22 million in the first three months of 2018, compared to approximately $1 million in foreign exchange gain in the same period of the prior year. The gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency.  Some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly, some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate that risk, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.    35    The following table details the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts grouped by functional currency and their expected maturity periods (in millions, except contract rates):                                As of March 31, 2018     December 31,2017     Functional Currency   2018     2019

  The Company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies for transactional exposures totaling $73 million and translation exposures totaling $173 million as of March 31, 2018 excluding trade receivables and payables, which approximate fair value. These market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10% movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on the transactional exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by $5 million and the translational exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect the future fair value by $17 million.  The counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential.  Interest Rate Risk  At March 31, 2018, long term borrowings consisted $1,393 million in 2.60% Senior Notes and $1,088 million in 3.95% Senior Notes. At March 31, 2018, there were no commercial paper borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility, resulting in $3.0 billion of funds available under this credit facility. Occasionally a portion of borrowings under our credit facility could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements. These instruments carry interest at a pre-agreed upon percentage point spread from either LIBOR, NIBOR or CDOR, or at the U.S. prime rate. Under our credit facility, we may, at our option, fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over LIBOR, NIBOR or CDOR for 30 days to six months. Our objective is to maintain a portion of our debt in variable rate borrowings for the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed-rate borrowings.    39    Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at a reasonable assurance level.  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    40    PART II—OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1A.
