Item 1A. Risk Factors.  The Company is also a party to claims, threatened and actual litigation, and private arbitration arising from ordinary day to day business activities, in which parties assert claims against the Company for a broad spectrum of potential claims and theories of liability, including: individual employment law claims, collective actions under federal employment laws, intellectual property claims, including alleged patent infringement, and/or misappropriation of trade secrets, premises liability claims, product liability claims, warranty claims, personal injuries arising from allegedly defective products, alleged improper payments under anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and other commercial claims seeking recovery for alleged actual or exemplary damages. For many such contingent claims, the Company’s insurance coverage is inapplicable or an exclusion to coverage may apply. In such instances, settlement or other resolution of such contingent claims could have a material financial or reputational impact on the Company. As of March 31, 2019, the Company recorded reserves in an amount believed to be enough for contingent liabilities representing all contingencies believed to be probable. The Company has assessed the potential for additional losses above the amounts accrued as well as potential losses for matters that are not probable but are reasonably possible. The litigation process as well as the final outcome of regulatory oversight is inherently uncertain, and our best judgment concerning the probable outcome of litigation or regulatory enforcement matters may prove to be incorrect in some instances. The total potential loss on these matters cannot be determined; however, in our opinion, any ultimate liability, to the extent not otherwise provided for, will not materially affect our financial position, cash flow or results of operations. These estimated liabilities are based on the Company’s assessment of the nature of these matters, their progress toward resolution, the advice of legal counsel and outside experts as well as management’s experience. Of course, because  17   of uncertainty and risk inherent to litigation and arbitration, the actual liabilities incurred may exceed our estimated liabilities and reserves, which could have a material financial or reputational impact on the Company. Further, in some instances, direct or indirect consumers of our products and services, entities providing financing for purchases of our products and services or members of the supply chain for our products and services have become involved in governmental investigations, internal investigations, political or other enforcement matters. In such circumstances, such investigations may adversely impact the ability of consumers of our products, entities providing financial support to such consumers or entities in the supply chain to timely perform their business plans or to timely perform under agreements with us. We may, from time to time, become involved in these investigations, at substantial cost to the Company. We also are subject to trade regulations and other regulatory compliance in which the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions conflict or trade regulations may conflict with contractual terms. In such circumstances, our compliance with U.S. laws and regulations may subject us to risk of fines, penalties or contractual liability in other jurisdictions. Our efforts to actively manage such risks may not always be successful which could lead to negative impacts on revenue or earnings.      15.  New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  In August 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2017-12 “Derivatives and Hedging – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities” (ASU 2017-12). This update improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships and simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this update on January 1, 2019, with no material impact. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (ASC Topic 842), which supersedes the lease requirements in ASC Topic No. 840 “Leases” and most industry-specific guidance. This update increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASC Topic 842 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU Topic 842 on January 1, 2019. Refer to Note 7, Leases, for the impact of this adoption on the Company’s financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, which allows for a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Company adopted ASU Topic 2018-02 on January 1, 2019 and elected not to reclassify stranded tax effects caused by tax reform from AOCI to retained earnings. Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This update improves financial reporting by requiring earlier recognition of credit losses on financing receivables and other financial assets in scope. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting this standard.   18   Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Introduction  National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

Demand for the segment’s products depends on drilling contractors’ and oil and gas companies’ capital spending plans, specifically capital expenditures on rig construction and refurbishment; and secondarily on the overall level of oilfield drilling activity, which drives demand for spare parts, service, and repair for the segment’s large installed base of equipment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  In our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified our most critical accounting policies. In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition (See Note 6); allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairment of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets); goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets; purchase price allocation of acquisitions; warranties; and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  For the first quarter ended March 31, 2019, the Company generated a net loss of $77 million, compared to net income of $12 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a net loss of $68 million in the first quarter of 2018. Operating loss for the first quarter of 2019 was $48 million, compared to operating profit of $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and an operating loss of $1 million in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2019 Adjusted EBITDA was $140 million, compared to $279 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $160 million in the first quarter of 2018. Segment Performance Wellbore Technologies Wellbore Technologies generated revenues of $807 million in the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of nine percent from the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase of 14 percent from the first quarter of 2018. The sharp pull-back in commodity prices in late 2018 amplified the typical seasonal first quarter slowdown in demand for equipment in international markets and resulted in lower levels of drilling activity and pricing pressure in North America, which contributed to the sequential decline in revenues. Commodity prices, activity levels, and the Segment’s financial results were higher in March, and bookings for drill pipe accelerated rapidly into quarter-end, resulting in the Company’s third straight sequential improvement in drill pipe orders. Operating profit was $19 million, or 2.4 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 25 percent sequentially and increased 14 percent from the prior year to $117 million, or 14.5 percent of sales.  Completion & Production Solutions Completion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $581 million in the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of 26 percent from the fourth quarter of 2018 and a decrease of 13 percent from the first quarter of 2018. The sequential decrease in revenues was a result of equipment deliveries that were pulled forward prior to year-end, limited order intake in late 2018 and the first two months of 2019, and customer-deferred deliveries. Operating loss was $35 million, and Adjusted EBITDA decreased $84 million sequentially and $45 million from the prior year to $28 million, or 4.8 percent of sales. Orders improved in March and totaled $470 million for the quarter, equal to the bookings in the fourth quarter and representing a book-to-bill of 149 percent when compared to the $316 million of orders shipped from backlog. Backlog for capital equipment orders for Completion & Production Solutions at March 31, 2019 was $1.04 billion. Rig Technologies Rig Technologies generated revenues of $603 million in the first quarter of 2019, a decrease of 25 percent from the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase of 25 percent from the first quarter of 2018. The sequential decline in revenues was due to lower contributions from offshore projects, fewer deliveries of capital equipment, and the first quarter seasonal decline in service and repair work. Operating  20   profit was $31 million, or 5.1 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 45 percent sequentially and increased 24 percent from the prior year to $56 million, or 9.3 percent of sales. New orders booked during the quarter totaled $271 million, representing a book-to-bill of 110 percent when compared to the $246 million of orders shipped from backlog. At March 31, 2019, backlog for capital equipment orders for Rig Technologies was $3.1 billion. Oil & Gas Equipment and Services Market and Outlook Following approximately two and a half years of steady improvements in oil prices and global drilling activity levels, commodity prices declined sharply during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to stronger than expected growth in US oil production and concerns regarding the global economy. These developments, along with pressure from investors on North American exploration and production companies to reduce investments and generate free cash flow, led to uncertainty in 2019 capital budgets and caused certain customers to accelerate deliveries of equipment prior to year-end. As a result, NOV reported a strong sequential improvement in its operations during the fourth quarter of 2018, despite oil prices that fell over 40 percent late in the year.  The uncertainty surrounding 2019 budgets, and the pull-forward of equipment deliveries into 2018, led to a sharp reduction in NOV’s first quarter of 2019 revenues; however, commodity prices increased and the Company’s bookings improved through the quarter. As a result, the Company anticipates each of its three operating segments will realize a sequential improvement in the second quarter.  Slowly improving activity in international and offshore markets, and growing market share for certain of NOV’s products and services, are expected to offset the near-term effects of capital austerity in the North American land marketplace. Longer-term, the Company remains optimistic regarding improvements in market fundamentals as existing oil and gas fields continue to deplete and numerous major projects to replenish supply have been deferred or canceled while global demand continues to grow. Notwithstanding this optimism, the market outlook remains uncertain. Therefore, NOV is committed to streamlining its operations and improving organizational efficiencies while continuing to invest in developing and acquiring new products and technologies that further advance the Company’s competitive position, regardless of the market environment. Operating Environment Overview The Company’s results are dependent on, among other things, the level of worldwide oil and gas drilling, well remediation activity, the prices of crude oil and natural gas, capital spending by other oilfield service companies and drilling contractors, and worldwide oil and gas inventory levels. Key industry indicators for the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, and the fourth quarter of 2018 include the following:                                                %        %                                                 1Q19        1Q19             1Q19*        1Q18*        4Q18*        1Q18        4Q18       Active Drilling Rigs:                                                                U.S.        1,046           965           1,072           8.4  %        (2.4  %)    Canada        185           273           177           (32.2  %)        4.5  %    International        1,029           970           1,011           6.1  %        1.8  %    Worldwide        2,260           2,208           2,260           2.4  %        (—  %)                                                                     West Texas Intermediate  Crude Prices (per barrel)     $  54.83        $  62.88        $  59.08           (12.8  %)        (7.2  %)                                                                     Natural Gas Prices ($/mmbtu)     $  2.87        $  3.04        $  3.77           (5.6  %)        (23.9  %)         *  Averages for the quarters indicated.

(www.bakerhughes.com); West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices: Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (www.eia.doe.gov).  The worldwide quarterly average rig count remained flat, and the U.S. decreased two percent (from 1,072 to 1,046), in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The average per barrel price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil decreased seven percent (from $59.08 per barrel to $54.83 per barrel) and natural gas prices decreased 24 percent (from $3.77 per mmbtu to $2.87 per mmbtu) in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.  U.S. rig activity at April 18, 2019 was 1,012 rigs, decreasing three percent compared to the first quarter of 2019 average of 1,046 rigs. The price for West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil was at $64.00 per barrel at April 18, 2019, increasing seventeen percent from the first quarter of 2019 average. The price for natural gas was at $2.49 per mmbtu at April 18, 2019, decreasing thirteen percent from the first quarter of 2019 average. 22   Results of Operations  Financial results by operating segment are as follows (in millions):             Three Months Ended             March 31,             2019        2018       Revenue:                            Wellbore Technologies     $  807        $  711       Completion & Production Solutions        581           670       Rig Technologies        603           483       Eliminations        (51  )        (69  )    Total revenue     $  1,940        $  1,795                                    Operating profit (loss):                            Wellbore Technologies     $  19           12       Completion & Production Solutions        (35  )        16       Rig Technologies        31           18       Eliminations and corporate costs        (63  )        (47  )    Total operating profit (loss)     $  (48  )     $  (1  )                                 Operating profit (loss)%:                            Wellbore Technologies        2.4  %        1.7  %    Completion & Production Solutions        (6.0  %)        2.4  %    Rig Technologies        5.1  %        3.7  %    Total operating profit (loss)%        (2.5  %)        (0.1  %)     Wellbore Technologies Three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Revenue from Wellbore Technologies was $807 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $711 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $96 million or 14 percent.  Operating profit from Wellbore Technologies was $19 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $12 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $7 million. The primary driver of the year over year increase was due to increased activity. Completion & Production Solutions Three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Revenue from Completion & Production Solutions was $581 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $670 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $89 million or 13 percent.  Operating loss from Completion & Production Solutions was $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to an operating profit of $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $51 million. Deferred deliveries of capital equipment was the primary drivers of the year over year decrease. The Completion & Productions Solutions segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major completion and production components or a contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $1.04 billion at March 31, 2019, an increase of $31 million, or three percent from backlog of $1.01 billion at March 31, 2018. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these factors, the Company reasonably expects approximately $840 million of revenue out of backlog for the remainder of 2019 and approximately $201 million of revenue out of backlog in 2020 and thereafter. At March 31, 2019, approximately 53 percent of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 78 percent of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets. Rig Technologies Three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Revenue from Rig Technologies was $603 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $483 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $120 million or 25 percent.  23   Operating profit from Rig Technologies was $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $13 million. The primary driver of the year over year increase was due to increased activity. The Rig Technologies segment monitors its capital equipment backlog to plan its business. New orders are added to backlog only when the Company receives a firm written order for major drilling rig components or a signed contract related to a construction project. The capital equipment backlog was $3.14 billion at March 31, 2019, an increase of $1.10 billion, or 53 percent, from backlog of $2.05 billion at March 31, 2018. Numerous factors may affect the timing of revenue out of backlog. Considering these factors, the Company reasonably expects approximately $658 million of revenue out of backlog for the remainder of 2019 and approximately $2.5 billion of revenue out of backlog in 2020 and thereafter. At March 31, 2019, approximately 33 percent of the capital equipment backlog was for offshore products and approximately 91 percent of the capital equipment backlog was destined for international markets.  Eliminations and corporate costs Eliminations and corporate costs were $63 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, respectively, compared to $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This change is primarily due to the change in intersegment eliminations. Sales from one segment to another generally are priced at estimated equivalent commercial selling prices; however, segments originating an external sale are credited with the full profit to the company. Eliminations include intercompany transactions conducted between the three reporting segments that are eliminated in consolidation. Intrasegment transactions are eliminated within each segment.  Other income (expense), net  Other income (expense), net were expenses of $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to expenses of $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The change in expense was primarily due to the fluctuations in foreign currencies.  Provision for income taxes  The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was 11.8% and (4.8)%, respectively. The Company established valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for losses and tax credits generated in 2018 and established valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for losses generated in 2019. The change in the effective tax rate from 2018 to 2019 was impacted by a change in jurisdictional mix of income between the two periods and 2019 had less adverse impact from the establishment of valuation allowances. 24   Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations  The Company discloses Adjusted EBITDA (defined as Operating Profit excluding Depreciation, Amortization and, when applicable, Other Items) in its periodic earnings press releases and other public disclosures to provide investors additional information about the results of ongoing operations. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate and manage the business. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace GAAP financial measures, such as Net Income. Other items include restructure costs for facility closures, inventory write downs, severance payments and adjustments of certain reserves.  The following tables set forth the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP financial measure (in millions):             Three Months Ended             March 31,        December 31,             2019        2018        2018       Operating profit (loss):                                        Wellbore Technologies     $  19        $  12        $  41       Completion & Production Solutions        (35  )        16           64       Rig Technologies        31           18           75       Eliminations and corporate costs        (63  )        (47  )        (93  )    Total operating profit (loss)     $  (48  )     $  (1  )     $  87                                                Other items:                                        Wellbore Technologies     $  (2  )     $  (3  )     $  24       Completion & Production Solutions        11           3           (3  )    Rig Technologies        2           6           —       Corporate        —           (18  )        —       Total other items     $  11        $  (12  )     $  21                                                Depreciation & amortization:                                        Wellbore Technologies     $  100        $  94        $  90       Completion & Production Solutions        52           54           51       Rig Technologies        23           21           27       Corporate        2           4           3       Total depreciation & amortization     $  177        $  173        $  171                                                Adjusted EBITDA:                                        Wellbore Technologies     $  117        $  103        $  155       Completion & Production Solutions        28           73           112       Rig Technologies        56           45           102       Eliminations and corporate costs        (61  )        (61  )        (90  )    Total Adjusted EBITDA     $  140        $  160        $  279                                                Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA:                                        GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Company     $  (77  )     $  (68  )     $  12       Noncontrolling interests        2           2           3       Provision (benefit) for income taxes        (10  )        3           26       Interest expense        25           24           22       Interest income        (6  )        (7  )        (7  )    Equity (income) loss in unconsolidated affiliate        —           (2  )        2       Other (income) expense, net        18           47           29       Depreciation and amortization        177           173           171       Other items        11           (12  )        21       Total Adjusted EBITDA     $  140        $  160        $  279      25     Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview  The Company assesses liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. The Company remains in a strong financial position, with resources available to reinvest in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures to meet short- and long-term objectives. The Company believes that cash on hand, cash generated from expected results of operations, amounts available under its credit facility and its commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, anticipated working capital needs and other cash requirements such as capital expenditures, debt and interest payments and dividend payments for the foreseeable future.  At March 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,270 million and total debt of $3,326 million. At December 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $1,427 million and total debt was $2,711 million. As of March 31, 2019, approximately $887 million of the $1,270 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries and the earnings associated with this cash were subject to U.S. taxation. If opportunities to invest in the U.S. are greater than available cash balances that are not subject to income tax, rather than repatriating cash, the Company may choose to borrow against its revolving credit facility or utilize its commercial paper program. The Company’s outstanding debt at March 31, 2019 was $3,326 million and consisted of $1,395 million in 2.60% Senior Notes, $1,088 million in 3.95% Senior Notes, and lease liabilities of $843 million. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at March 31, 2019.  At March 31, 2019, there were no commercial paper borrowings, and there were no outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility, resulting in $3.0 billion of funds available under this credit facility.  The Company had $470 million of outstanding letters of credit at March 31, 2019, primarily in the U.S. and Norway, that are under various bilateral letter of credit facilities. Letters of credit are issued as bid bonds, advanced payment bonds and performance bonds. The following table summarizes our net cash provided by continuing operating activities, continuing investing activities and continuing financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):              Three Months Ended             March 31,             2019        2018       Net cash used by operating activities     $  (38  )     $  (129  )    Net cash used in investing activities        (107  )        (61  )    Net cash used in financing activities        (20  )        (18  )     Operating Activities For the first three months of 2019, cash used by operating activities was $38 million compared to $129 million in the same period of 2018. Before changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, cash was provided primarily by net loss from operations of $75 million plus non-cash charges of $203 million.  The change in operating assets and liabilities in the first three months of 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 was primarily due to the building of inventories in connection with increased orders for the quarter and a reduction in accrued liabilities. Partially offsetting was a favorable change in accounts receivable. Net changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions, used $166 million of cash for the first three months of 2019 compared to cash provided of $258 million in the same period in 2018. From time to time, we participate in factoring arrangements to sell accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions. In the first three months of 2019, we sold accounts receivable of $141 million at a cost of approximately $1 million, receiving cash proceeds totaling $140 million. Our factoring transactions in the first three months of 2019 were recognized as sales, and the proceeds are included as operating cash flows in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 26   Investing Activities For the first three months of 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $107 million compared to $61 million for the same period of 2018. Net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of capital expenditures and acquisition activity. The Company used $65 million during the first three months of 2019 for acquisitions compared to $36 million for the same period of 2018 and $43 million for capital expenditures in the first three months of 2019 compared to $39 million for the same period of 2018.  Financing Activities For the first three months of 2019, net cash used in financing activities was $20 million compared to $18 million for the same period of 2018. This decrease was primarily the result of financing lease payments of $7 million for the first three months of 2019 compared to $2 million in 2018. Dividends paid were $19 million for each of the first three months of 2019 and 2018. Other The effect of the change in exchange rates on cash flows was an increase of $8 million and $7 million for the first three months of 2019 and 2018, respectively.  We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facilities and from other sources of debt will be sufficient to fund operations, lease payments, working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, dividends and financing obligations. We intend to pursue additional acquisition candidates, but the timing, size or success of any acquisition effort and the related potential capital commitments cannot be predicted. We continue to expect to fund future cash acquisitions primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including the unborrowed portion of the revolving credit facility or new debt issuances, but may also issue additional equity either directly or in connection with acquisitions. There can be no assurance that additional financing for acquisitions will be available at terms acceptable to us.  New Accounting Pronouncements See Note 15 for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. Forward-Looking Statements  Some of the information in this document contains, or has incorporated by reference, forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as “may,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” and similar words, although some forward-looking statements are expressed differently. All statements herein regarding expected merger synergies are forward-looking statements. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from results anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to changes in oil and gas prices, customer demand for our products, difficulties encountered in integrating mergers and acquisitions, and worldwide economic activity. You should also consider carefully the statements under “Risk Factors,” as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which address additional factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, current or prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any such factors or forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.    27       Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Additional information concerning each of these matters follows:  Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  We have extensive operations in foreign countries. The net assets and liabilities of these operations are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, although such fluctuations generally do not affect income since their functional currency is typically the local currency. These operations also have net assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency, which exposes us to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that impact income. We recorded a foreign exchange loss in our income statement of approximately $9 million in the first three months of 2019, compared to approximately $22 million in the same period of the prior year. The gains and losses are primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations related to monetary asset balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency and adjustments to our hedged positions as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may create losses in future periods to the extent we maintain net monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the countries using the local currency as their functional currency.  Some of our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those U.S. dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency. Similarly, some of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, but have associated U.S. dollar costs, which also give rise to foreign currency exchange rate exposure. In order to mitigate that risk, we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes.  The Company had other financial market risk sensitive instruments denominated in foreign currencies for transactional exposures totaling $20 million and translation exposures totaling $161 million as of March 31, 2019 excluding trade receivables and payables, which approximate fair value. These market risk sensitive instruments consisted of cash balances and overdraft facilities. The Company estimates that a hypothetical 10 percent movement of all applicable foreign currency exchange rates on the transactional exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect net income by $2 million and the translational exposures financial market risk sensitive instruments could affect the future fair value by $16 million. The counterparties to forward contracts are major financial institutions. The credit ratings and concentration of risk of these financial institutions are monitored on a continuing basis. In the event that the counterparties fail to meet the terms of a foreign currency contract, our exposure is limited to the foreign currency rate differential.  Interest Rate Risk At March 31, 2019, long term borrowings consisted $1,395 million in 2.60% Senior Notes and $1,088 million in 3.95% Senior Notes. At March 31, 2019, there were no commercial paper borrowings and no outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit facility, resulting in $3.0 billion of funds available under this credit facility. Occasionally a portion of borrowings under our credit facility could be denominated in multiple currencies which could expose us to market risk with exchange rate movements. These instruments carry interest at a pre-agreed upon percentage point spread from either LIBOR, NIBOR or CDOR, or at the U.S. prime rate. Under our credit facility, we may, at our option, fix the interest rate for certain borrowings based on a spread over LIBOR, NIBOR or CDOR for 30 days to six months. Our objective is to maintain a portion of our debt in variable rate borrowings for the flexibility obtained regarding early repayment without penalties and lower overall cost as compared with fixed-rate borrowings.     Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report at a reasonable assurance level.  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 28     PART II - OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1A.  Risk Factors As of the date of this filing, the Company and its operations continue to be subject to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
