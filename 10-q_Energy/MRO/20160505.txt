Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us.Capital ResourcesCredit Arrangements and BorrowingsAt March 31, 2016, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility. At March 31, 2016, we had $7.3 billion in long-term debt outstanding, with our next debt maturity in the amount of $680 million due in the fourth quarter of 2017. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of equity and debt securities. 27Asset Disposals Since August 2015, we have announced or closed non-core asset sales of approximately $1.3 billion, surpassing our targeted range of $750 million to $1 billion. In the largest transaction, we will divest all of our Wyoming upstream and midstream assets for $870 million, before closing adjustments, with closing expected mid-year 2016. In separate transactions, we signed agreements for the sale of our 10% working interest in the outside-operated Shenandoah discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, operated natural gas assets in the Piceance basin in Colorado, and certain undeveloped acreage in West Texas for a combined total of approximately $80 million, before closing adjustments, with closing expected mid-year 2016.Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital Ratio Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash and cash equivalents to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash and cash equivalents) was 21% at March 31, 2016, compared to 25% at December 31, 2015.

On April 27, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.05 per share for the first quarter of 2016 payable June 10, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 18, 2016. As of March 31, 2016, we plan to make contributions of up to $48 million to our funded pension plans during the remainder of 2016. Contractual Cash ObligationsAs of March 31, 2016, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.           Environmental Matters We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes.There have been no significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2015.Other ContingenciesWe are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 28Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").

Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.

During the first quarter of 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.31Part II – OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.
