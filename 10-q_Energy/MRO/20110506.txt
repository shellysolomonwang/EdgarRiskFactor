Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Plan to Create Independent Downstream Company   On January 13, 2011, the Board of Directors of Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon”) announced that it has approved moving forward with plans to spin-off Marathon’s downstream (Refining, Marketing and Transportation) business, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”) and Marathon Oil Corporation (“MRO”). To affect the spin-off, Marathon intends to distribute one share of MPC for every two shares of Marathon held at a record date to be determined. The transaction is expected to be effective June 30, 2011, with distribution of MPC shares shortly thereafter. A tax ruling request was submitted to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the tax-free nature of the spin-off and Marathon anticipates a response during the second quarter of 2011. The above discussion of the plans to create an independent downstream company includes forward looking statements. Factors which could affect the plans include board approval, receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and a registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).       Overview and Outlook     Exploration and Production   Libya   Civil unrest, which began in February 2011 in parts of North Africa, escalated to armed conflict in Libya where we have exploration and production operations. During the first quarter 2011, all production operations in Libya were suspended and we are not currently making deliveries of hydrocarbons from our interest in the Waha concession in eastern Libya. As of March 31, 2011, our net property, plant and equipment investment in Libya is approximately $761 million and we are in an underlift position of 847 thousand barrels of liquid hydrocarbons, net to our interest. Sales from Libya in 2010 averaged 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The impact of continued unrest upon our investment and future operations in Libya is unknown at this time.   In addition, payments due to the Libyan government or entities affiliated with the Libyan government have been blocked by the U.S. government under a February 25, 2011 executive order. As of March 31, 2011, such amounts, primarily related to taxes and royalties due on our January and February 2011 sales, totaled approximately $200 million.   Production   Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales averaged 400 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”) during the first quarter of 2011 compared to 361 mboepd in the same quarter of 2010. Sales volumes increased in the U.S., primarily due to the Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico which commenced production mid-year 2010. Internationally, increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in Norway were partially offset by the impact of Libyan production operations being suspended during the first quarter of 2011. Natural gas sales from Equatorial Guinea are           18       higher as our operations were not producing for a portion of the first quarter of 2010 due to a planned turnaround at our production facilities.   Exploration   We commenced drilling our first operated exploration well in the Eagle Ford shale in Texas during the first quarter of 2011. As we continue our strategy of focusing on unconventional, liquids-rich resource plays we have increased our holdings in the Eagle Ford shale to approximately 29,000 acres, with rights to acquire an additional 61,000 acres.   In April 2011, we assigned a 30 percent undivided working interest in approximately 180,000 net acres in the Niobrara Shale play located within the DJ Basin of southeast Wyoming and northern Colorado for a total consideration of $270 million, or $5,000 per acre. As operator of this jointly owned leasehold, we are currently acquiring seismic data and expect to drill eight to twelve gross wells by yearend.   During the first quarter of 2011, on the Birchwood oil sands lease located in Alberta, Canada, we drilled 94 stratigraphic test wells. The drilling results are currently being evaluated. Initial results are positive, with the wells encountering expected or greater-than-expected reservoir potential.   Also in April 2011, we farmed-out a 40 percent working interest in 10 concessions in Poland’s Paleozoic Shale play. We are currently acquiring seismic and plan to drill one to two gross wells in the fourth quarter of 2011.   We announced a discovery on the Atrush block in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. We have a 16 percent ownership in this outside operated block. The Atrush-1 well was drilled to a total depth of approximately 11,000 feet and encountered pay in the Jurassic zones. Test flow rates of more than 6,000 gross barrels per day were limited by tubing sizes and testing equipment.   We have completed drilling the Romeo prospect in the Pasangkayu block offshore Indonesia. The well was drilled in a water depth of approximately 6,300 feet and reached a total depth of 11,804 feet, but was dry. Exploration expenses for the first quarter of 2011 include well costs incurred through March 31, 2011. Additionally, approximately $25 million will be charged to exploration expense in the second quarter of 2011.   In March 2011, we completed our evaluation of the Flying Dutchman exploratory well, located on Green Canyon Block 511 in the Gulf of Mexico. We determined that the options to develop were not viable and reported the remaining well cost in exploration expense in the first quarter of 2011.   Divestitures   In March 2011, we closed the sale of our E&P segment's outside-operated interests in the Gudrun field development and the Brynhild and Eirin exploration areas offshore Norway for net proceeds of $85 million, excluding working capital adjustments. A $64 million pretax loss on this disposition was recorded in the fourth quarter 2010.   The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to an agreement pursuant to which we will farm-out a portion of our interest in Poland’s shale play, the timing and levels of future production, and anticipated future exploratory drilling activity. Some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorists acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The completion of the agreement to farm-out a portion of our interest in Poland’s shale play is subject to customary closing conditions. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.   Oil Sands Mining   Our net synthetic crude oil sales were 37 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 25 mbpd in the same quarter of 2010, reflecting the impact of the Jackpine mine in 2011, which commenced production in a phased start-up in the third quarter of 2010 and began supplying oil sands ore to the base processing facility in the fourth quarter.   The upgrader operation of the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”) Expansion 1 began commissioning as scheduled late in the fourth quarter of 2010 and continued through the first quarter of 2011. In May 2011, the operator announced the successful start of commercial production at the upgrader expansion. With production capacity at the AOSP now at 255,000 gross barrels per day, the focus will be on improving operating efficiencies and adding capacity through debottlenecking. We hold a 20 percent working interest in the AOSP.   Integrated Gas   Our share of LNG sales worldwide totaled 7,822 metric tonnes per day (“mtpd”) for the first quarter of 2011 compared to 5,792 mtpd in the first quarter of 2010. These LNG sales volumes include both consolidated sales volumes and our share of the sales volumes of equity method investees. LNG sales from Alaska are conducted through a consolidated subsidiary. The LNG plant in Alaska will close later in 2011 than previously announced because some sales have been contracted into the summer. LNG and methanol sales from Equatorial Guinea are conducted through equity method investees that purchase dry gas from our E&P assets in Equatorial Guinea. The sales increase in the          19       first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010 is mainly due to the planned turnaround at the Equatorial Guinea gas production facilities in the first quarter of 2010, which significantly reduced natural gas volumes to the LNG and methanol facilities.   Refining, Marketing and Transportation   Our total refinery throughputs were 20 percent higher in the first quarter of 2011 than in the first quarter of 2010. The higher refinery throughputs were a result of improved refinery utilization and decreased turnaround activity in the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010, primarily at our Garyville, Louisiana refinery. Crude oil refined increased 11 percent for the same period and other charge and blendstocks increased 113 percent.   During the first quarter of 2011, we initiated a turnaround at the Canton, Ohio refinery which was completed in April 2011. This compares to the turnarounds we completed at both the Garyville, Louisiana and the Texas City, Texas refineries in the first quarter of 2010. We also initiated a turnaround at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery in the first quarter of 2010 which was completed in April 2010.   Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline increased to an average of 67 mbpd in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 63 mbpd in the same period of 2010. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of ethanol supply and government regulations.   First quarter 2011 Speedway LLC (“Speedway”) same store gasoline sales volumes were comparable to the first quarter of 2010, while same store merchandise sales increased 2 percent for the same period. During the first quarter, Speedway was ranked the nation’s top retail gasoline brand for the third consecutive year, according to the 2011 EquiTrend® Brand Study conducted by Harris Interactive®.   As of March 31, 2011, the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan, refinery was approximately 55 percent complete and on schedule for an expected completion in the second half of 2012.   In April 2011, Speedway was the winning bidder at an auction for 23 retail outlets in Illinois and Indiana for approximately $70 million. We expect to close on this purchase in May 2011, subject to customary closing conditions.   The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the Detroit refinery project and Speedway’s purchase of retail outlets. Factors that could affect the Detroit project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could affect Speedway’s purchase of retail outlets include customary closing conditions, such as government and regulatory approvals. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.      Market Conditions   Exploration and Production   Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists the benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages in the first quarter in 2011, when compared to the same period in 2010.             Three Months Ended March 31,            2011       2010      West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 94.60     $ 78.88     Dated Brent crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 105.43     $ 76.36     Henry Hub natural gas   (Dollars per million British thermal units)(a)    $ 4.11     $ 5.30         (a)   First-of-month price index.      Crude oil prices increased consistently during the first three months of 2011, resulting in a higher quarterly average for the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010.   Our domestic crude oil production was about 70 percent sour in the first quarter of 2011. Sour crude oil contains more sulfur than light sweet WTI. Sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of its higher refining costs and lower refined product values. Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and a majority is sold in relation to the Dated Brent crude oil benchmark.   Natural gas prices for the first quarter of 2011 were lower compared to the same quarter of prior year. A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Our other major natural gas-producing regions are Europe and Equatorial Guinea, where our natural gas sales have been and, in the case of Equatorial Guinea primarily, still are subject to term contracts, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. The natural gas being sold from           20        these regions, primarily Equatorial Guinea, is at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average natural gas realized prices may not fully track market price movements.   Oil Sands Mining   OSM segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce. Roughly two-thirds of our normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil market, primarily Western Canadian Select. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader.   The operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per unit costs are sensitive to production rate. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively.   The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the first quarter of 2011 compared to first quarter of 2010.               Three Months Ended March 31,      Benchmark       2011       2010      WTI crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 94.60     $ 78.88     Western Canadian Select   (Dollars per barrel)(a)    $ 71.24     $ 69.67     AECO natural gas sales index   (Dollars per mmbtu)(b)    $ 3.85     $ 4.80         (a)    Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada.        (b)    Monthly average AECO day ahead index.      Integrated Gas   Our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, primarily in the U.S., Europe and West Africa.   Our most significant LNG investment is our 60 percent ownership in a production facility in Equatorial Guinea, which sells LNG under a long-term contract at prices tied to Henry Hub natural gas prices. In general, LNG delivered to the U.S. is tied to Henry Hub prices and will track with changes in U.S. natural gas prices, while LNG sold in Europe and Asia is indexed to crude oil prices and will track the movement of those prices.   We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Equatorial Guinea through our investment in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”). Methanol demand has a direct impact on AMPCO’s earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. AMPCO’s plant capacity of 1.1 million tones is about 3 percent of total world demand.     Refining, Marketing and Transportation   RM&T segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, refinery throughputs and retail marketing gross margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise.   Our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads that we feel most closely track our operations and slate of products. Posted Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) crude oil prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of crude oil refined into 3 barrels of gasoline, 2 barrels of distillate and 1 barrel of residual fuel) are used for the crack spread calculation.   Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly causing our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin to differ from the crack spreads which are based upon sweet crude. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin.              21         The following table lists calculated average crack spreads for the Midwest and Gulf Coast markets and the sweet/sour differential for the first quarters of 2011 and 2010:             Three Months Ended March 31,      (Dollars per barrel)     2011       2010      Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread    $ 0.16     $ 2.68     U.S. Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread    $ 1.32     $ 3.50     Sweet/Sour differential    $ 12.57 (a)   $ 5.23 (b)       (a)   Calculated using the following mix of crude types: 15% Arab Light, 20% Kuwait, 10% Maya, 10% Western Canadian Select and 45% Mars compared to LLS.        (b)   Calculated using the following mix of crude types: 15% Arab Light, 20% Kuwait, 10% Maya, 15% Western Canadian Select and 40% Mars compared to LLS.        Our realized refining and wholesale gross marketing margin in first quarter of 2011 improved despite the lower LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010. The increased margin is primarily due to a 140 percent widening of the sweet/sour differential and the wider than normal differentials between WTI and other light sweet crudes such as LLS and Dated Brent. Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 54 percent of the crude oil processed in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 52 percent in the comparable period in 2010.   In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads and sweet/sour differential, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:       ∙   the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed    ∙   the selling prices realized for refined products    ∙   the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to manage price risk    ∙   the cost of products purchased for resale and    ∙   changes in manufacturing costs which include depreciation.      Manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units are periodically performed at each refinery.   Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the cost of refined products, including secondary transportation and consumer excise taxes, also impacts RM&T segment profitability. There are numerous factors including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions that impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year. The gross margin on merchandise sold at retail outlets has been historically less volatile.          22          Results of Operations   Consolidated Results of Operations   Consolidated net income in the first quarter of 2011 was 118 percent higher than in the same quarter of 2010. Increasing liquid hydrocarbon prices and the RM&T segment refining and wholesale marketing gross margin contributed significantly to the income increase.                      Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table:                         Three Months Ended March 31,      (In millions)     2011       2010      E&P    $ 3,382     $ 2,551     OSM      306       186     IG      64       27     RM&T      17,842       13,362      Segment revenues      21,594       16,126     Elimination of intersegment revenues      (690 )     (412 )    Total revenues    $ 20,904     $ 15,714                        Items included in both revenues and costs and expenses:                     Consumer excise taxes on petroleum products and merchandise    $ 1,209     $ 1,212       E&P segment revenues increased $831 million in the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable prior-year period primarily a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations. Liquid hydrocarbon realizations averaged $95.79 per barrel in the first quarter of 2011 compared to $74.35 in the first quarter of 2010. Revenues in the first quarter of 2010 included gains on derivatives of $51 million. All derivative positions closed in December 2010.   Net sales volumes during the quarter averaged 400 mboepd, compared to 361 mboepd for the same period last year. This 11 percent increase in sales volumes reflects the liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production increases previously discussed.   The following tables report E&P segment realizations and sales volumes in greater detail for both quarters.

(b)   Excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments.      OSM segment revenues increased $120 million in the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable prior-year period. The increase was driven primarily by a 15 percent increase in average realizations. Net synthetic crude sales for the first quarter of 2011 were 37 mbpd at an average realized price of $84.98 per barrel compared to 25 mbpd at $73.76 in the same period of 2010. The increased sales volumes are a result of the start-up of the Jackpine Mine in the fourth quarter of 2010.   Revenues in 2010 included a net loss of $10 million on derivative instruments intended to mitigate price risk related to future sales of synthetic crude. All derivative positions closed in December 2010.   IG segment revenues increased $37 million in the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable prior-year period, predominantly as a result of increased realizations.   RM&T segment revenues increased $4,480 million in the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable prior-year period, as a result of increased refined product selling prices and volumes. The wholesale benchmark prices are listed on the table below.             Three Months Ended March 31,      (Dollars per gallon)     2011       2010      Chicago Spot Unleaded regular gasoline    $ 2.57     $ 2.02     Chicago Spot Ultra-low sulfur diesel      2.80       2.04     U.S. Gulf Coast Spot Unleaded regular gasoline      2.60       2.05     U.S. Gulf Coast Spot Ultra-low sulfur diesel    $ 2.84     $ 2.06       Income from equity method investments increased $21 million in the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable prior-year period. Higher commodity prices in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 positively impacted the earnings of many of our equity method investees.   Net gain on disposal of assets in the first quarter of 2010 was primarily the $811 million gain on the sale of a 20 percent outside-operated undivided interest in our E&P segment’s Production Sharing and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola.   Cost of revenues increased $3,297 million in the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable prior-year period. The increase resulted primarily from higher acquisition costs and increased volumes of crude oil and refinery charge and blendstocks in the RM&T segment. Additionally, turnaround costs in the first quarter of 2011 were $180 million lower than in the same period of 2010 due to the timing of such projects in our RM&T and OSM segments.   Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) increased $203 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same quarter of 2010. Increased DD&A related to the higher sales volumes in our E&P and OSM segments, as previously discussed.   Long-lived asset impairments in the first quarter of 2010 were primarily related to the Powder River Basin. In March 2010, our reservoir study concluded and a portion of our Powder River Basin field was removed from our plans for future development, resulting in a $423 million impairment (see Note 10).   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense.         24        Exploration expenses were $230 million in the first quarter of 2011, including expenses related to dry wells of $159 million, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and Indonesia. Exploration expenses were $98 million in the first quarter of 2010, including expenses related to dry wells of $32 million, primarily related to Alaska and Equatorial Guinea.   Provision for income taxes increased $250 million in the first quarter of 2011 from the comparable period of 2010 primarily due to the increase in pretax income. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, we have suspended production operations in Libya, where the statutory tax rate is in excess of 90 percent. As a result, our effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2011 was significantly lower than it was in the comparable period of 2010.   The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for the first three months of 2011 and 2010.           Three Months Ended March 31,          2011       2010      Statutory U.S. income tax rate      35  %     35  %   Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits      2       14     Adjustments to valuation allowances      6       1     State and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effects      1       (1 )   Tax law change      -       5     Other tax effects      (1 )     (1 )    Effective income tax rate for continuing operations      43  %     53  %     The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in “Corporate and other unallocated items.”          25             Segment Results                     Segment income is summarized in the following table:                         Three Months Ended March 31,      (In millions)     2011       2010      E&P                                United States    $ 30     $ 109      International      638       393      E&P segment      668       502     OSM      32       (17 )   IG      60       44     RM&T      527       (237 )    Segment income      1,287       292      Corporate and other unallocated items      (90 )     (10 )    Foreign currency remeasurement of taxes      (14 )     33      Loss on extinguishment of debt      (176 )     -      Gain on disposition      -       449      Long-lived asset impairment      -       (262 )    Deferred income taxes - tax legislation changes      -       (45 )    Spin-off related costs      (11 )     -     Net income    $ 996     $ 457       United States E&P income decreased $79 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. Increased realizations and sales volumes were offset by higher DD&A and exploration expense in the first quarter of 2011. In addition, the first quarter of 2010 benefited from a $51 million derivative gain. The commodity derivative contracts expired in December 2010.   International E&P income increased $245 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. This increase in income is primarily related to a 33 percent increase in liquid hydrocarbon realizations. Partially offsetting the impact of realizations was higher DD&A and exploration expenses, including the dry well costs previously discussed.   OSM segment reported income of $32 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to a loss of $17 million in the first quarter of 2010. The segment income increase in the first quarter of 2011 is primarily a result of the previously discussed higher realizations and increased volumes. The first quarter of 2010 included costs of $30 million related to a turnaround that began in March 2010 and a net loss on derivatives of $10 million. The derivative contracts expired in December 2010.   IG segment income increased $16 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010, primarily as a result of higher realizations and LNG sales volumes. LNG sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were impacted by the planned turnaround at our production facilities in Equatorial Guinea.   RM&T segment income increased $764 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. The income increase was primarily a result of a higher refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, which was a positive 16.24 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2011 compared to a negative 5.69 cents per gallon in the comparable period of 2010. Several factors contributed to the higher first quarter 2011 refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, including a wider sweet/sour differential, favorable crude acquisition costs resulting from wider than normal differentials between WTI and other light, sweet crudes such as LLS and Dated Brent, an increase in sour crude processed and lower planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of approximately $150 million, pretax.   Our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin also included pretax derivative losses of $58 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared to losses of $23 million in the first quarter of 2010.   Cash Flows and Liquidity     Cash Flows   Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,592 million in the first three months of 2011, compared to $849 million in the first three months of 2010 reflecting primarily the impact of higher liquid hydrocarbon and refined product prices on operating income.   Net cash used in investing activities totaled $833 million in the first three months of 2011, compared to $10 million in the first three months of 2010. Significant investing activities are additions to property, plant and equipment           26        and disposal of assets. In the first quarter of 2011, most of the additions were in the E&P segment with continued spending on U.S. unconventional resource plays and drilling in Norway, Indonesia and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. This compares to spending in the first quarter of 2010 which was more focused upon the U.S., particularly the Gulf of Mexico. Spending has slowed compared to 2010 in our OSM segment as the upgrader portion of AOSP Expansion 1 began operations in May 2011. In the RM&T segment, the expansion and upgrading of our Detroit, Michigan refinery continues. In the first quarter of 2010, proceeds from the sale of a portion of our interest in Block 32 offshore Angola approximated spending on property, plant and equipment additions in the quarter.   Net cash provided by financing activities was $2 million in the first three months of 2011, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $172 million in the first three months of 2010. Dividends paid were a significant use of cash in both periods. During the first quarter of 2011, we issued $3 billion in Senior Notes and retired $2.5 billion principal amount of our debt.      Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations and our $3.0 billion committed revolving credit facility. Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, share repurchase program, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.   Activities Related to Plan to Create Independent Downstream Company   On February 1, 2011, MPC, currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon, completed a private placement of three series of Senior Notes aggregating $3 billion (the "Notes"). The Notes are intended to establish a minimum $750 million initial cash balance for MPC upon the planned spin-off of Marathon's downstream business. All cash above that level will be used to repay existing intercompany debt with Marathon, and any remaining proceeds will be distributed to Marathon on or before June 30, 2011. The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of MPC which are guaranteed by Marathon on a senior unsecured basis. Marathon's guarantees will terminate upon completion of the spin-off.   In February and March 2011, we retired $2.5 billion principal amount of debt at a weighted average price equal to 112 percent of face value, recognizing a $279 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt.   See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about these transactions.   Capital Resources   At March 31, 2011, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility.   During the third quarter of 2010, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.   Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 10 percent at March 31, 2011, compared to 14 percent at December 31, 2010. This includes $231 million of debt that is serviced by United States Steel.          27                March 31,       December 31,      (In millions)     2011       2010       Long-term debt due within one year     $ 349     $ 295      Long-term debt      7,992       7,601                         Total debt    $ 8,341     $ 7,896                         Cash     $ 5,716     $ 3,951      Equity    $ 24,705     $ 23,771                         Calculation:                                        Total debt    $ 8,341     $ 7,896      Minus cash      5,716       3,951                         Total debt minus cash    $ 2,625     $ 3,945                         Total debt      8,341       7,896      Plus equity      24,705       23,771      Minus cash      5,716       3,951                         Total debt plus equity minus cash    $ 27,330     $ 27,716                         Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio      10 %     14 %     Capital Requirements   On April 27, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a 25 cents per share dividend, payable June 10, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 18, 2011.   Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production, refining and mining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.   Contractual Cash Obligations   As of March 31, 2011, our consolidated contractual cash obligations have increased by $2,761 million from December 31, 2010. Our purchase obligations under crude oil, refinery feedstock, refined product and ethanol contracts, which are primarily short term, increased $2,497 million due to increased prices and volumes for crude oil when comparing March 31, 2011 to December 31, 2010. Long-term debt increased by $501 million due to the issuance of the $3 billion in Senior Notes and retirement of $2.5 billion principal amount of debt. Our obligations under contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment decreased $297 million due to the disposition of some of our outside-operated assets offshore Norway. There have been no other significant changes to our obligations to make future payments under existing contracts subsequent to December 31, 2010. The portion of our obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by United States Steel has not changed significantly subsequent to December 31, 2010.   Nonrecourse Indebtedness of Investees   Certain of our investees have incurred indebtedness that we do not support through guarantees or otherwise. If we were obligated to share in this debt on a pro rata ownership basis, our share would have been $248 million as of March 31, 2011.   Receivable from United States Steel   We remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for $231 million of certain debt and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel Corporation (“United States Steel”) has assumed responsibility for repayment (see the USX Separation in Item 1. of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K). United States Steel reported in its Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2011 that it believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future.        28        Critical Accounting Estimates   There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates subsequent to December 31, 2010.     Environmental Matters   We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil, refined products and feedstocks.   We have finalized our strategic approach to comply with Mobile Source Air Toxics II (“MSAT II”) regulations related to benzene content in refined products and updated the project cost estimates to comply with these requirements. We estimate that we may spend approximately $650 million over a four-year period that began in 2008. Our actual MSAT II expenditures have totaled $555 million through March 31, 2011, with $33 million in the first quarter of 2011. We expect total year 2011 spending will be approximately $100 million. The cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as further work is completed in 2011.   On January 21, 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”) issued a second waiver for the use of E15 under the Clean Air Act to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10 percent (“E10”) to 15 percent (“E15”) in vehicle model years 2001-2006. The first partial waiver was issued on October 13, 2010, for 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which would need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed for use in any traditional gasoline engines.   There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2010.     Other Contingencies   We are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.          29         Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Disclosures about how derivatives are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how the fair values of our derivative instruments are measured may be found in Note 10 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.   Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices on our open commodity derivative instruments as of March 31, 2011 is provided in the following table.

Controls and Procedures     An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarter ended March 31, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.            30         MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited)                          Three Months Ended March 31,      (In millions)     2011       2010                     Segment Income (Loss)                 Exploration and Production                 United States    $ 30     $ 109      International      638       393      E&P segment      668       502      Oil Sands Mining      32       (17 )    Integrated Gas      60       44      Refining, Marketing and Transportation      527       (237 )    Segment income      1,287       292      Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes      (291 )     165      Net income    $ 996     $ 457     Capital Expenditures(a)                     Exploration and Production                     United States    $ 349     $ 458      International      319       145      E&P segment      668       603      Oil Sands Mining      120       265      Integrated Gas      1       1      Refining, Marketing and Transportation      200       310      Corporate      6       -      Total    $ 995     $ 1,179     Exploration Expenses                     United States    $ 151     $ 46      International      79       52      Total    $ 230     $ 98         (a)    Capital expenditures include changes in accruals.                31         MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited)                           Three Months Ended March 31,          2011       2010                     E&P Operating Statistics                 Net Liquid Hydrocarbon Sales (mbpd)                  United States      78       58                         Europe      111       85      Africa      58       83      Total International      169       168      Worldwide      247       226                         Natural Gas Sales (mmcfd)                     United States      368       351                         Europe(b)      102       109      Africa      446       353      Total International      548       462      Worldwide      916       813                         Total Worldwide Sales (mboepd)      400       361                         Average Realizations                      Liquid Hydrocarbons (per bbl)                     United States    $ 86.42     $ 72.46                         Europe      109.85       78.95      Africa      81.47       70.96      Total International      100.10       75.01      Worldwide    $ 95.79     $ 74.35                         Natural Gas (per mcf)                     United States    $ 5.15     $ 5.49                         Europe      10.29       6.17      Africa(c)      0.25       0.25      Total International      2.12       1.65      Worldwide    $ 3.34     $ 3.31         (b)   Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 15 mmcfd and 25 mmcfd for the first three months of 2011 and 2010.

Legal Proceedings   We are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain of these matters are discussed below.   In March 2011, Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (“Noble”) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Harris County, Texas alleging, among other things, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent misrepresentation, relating to a multi-year drilling contract for a newly constructed drilling rig to be deployed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We filed an answer in April 2011, contending, among other things, failure to perform, failure to comply with material obligations, failure to mitigate alleged damages and that Noble failed to provide the rig according to the operating, performance and safety requirements specified in the drilling contract. Noble is seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are vigorously defending this litigation. The ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, including any financial effect on us, remains uncertain. We do not believe an estimate of a reasonably probable loss (or range of loss) can be made for this lawsuit at this time.     Environmental Proceedings   In January 2011, the U.S. EPA notified us of 18 alleged violations of various statutory and regulatory provisions related to motor fuels, some of which we had previously self-reported to the U.S. EPA. No formal enforcement action has been commenced and no demand for penalties has been asserted by the U.S. EPA in connection with these alleged violations. However, it is possible that the U.S. EPA could seek penalties in excess of $100,000 in connection with one or more of the alleged violations. We met with the U.S. EPA on March 7, 2011 at their request, to provide additional information concerning one of the allegations.   Item 1A. Risk Factors   We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A.
