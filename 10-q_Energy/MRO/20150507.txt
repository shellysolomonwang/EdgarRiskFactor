Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional disclosures regarding our open derivative positions, including underlying notional quantities, how they are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how their fair values are measured, may be found in Notes 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.During the first quarter of 2015, we entered into crude oil derivatives related to a portion of our forecasted North America E&P sales which consisted of three-way collars with swaptions. The table below provides a summary of open positions as of March 31, 2015: Crude Oil Derivative PositionsThree-way collars with swaptions Barrels per day 25,000 IndexNYMEX WTI Weighted average price per barrel:  Ceiling $71.67 Floor $55.00 Sold put $40.00 Remaining Term (a)April - December 2015(a)Counterparties have the option to exercise fixed-price swaps (swaptions) at a weighted average price of $71.67 per barrel indexed to NYMEX WTI, which is exercisable on October 30, 2015. If the counterparties exercise, the term of the fixed-price swaps would be for calendar year 2016 and, if all such options are exercised, for 25,000 barrels per day. The following table provides a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect on income from operations ("IFO") of a hypothetical 10% change in NYMEX WTI prices on our open commodity derivative instruments as of March 31, 2015.

These derivatives consist of three-way collars with sold call options and stand-alone three-way collars. The corresponding terms of these derivative positions entered into from April 1 through May 5, 2015 are shown in the table below:Crude Oil Derivative PositionsThree-way collars  Barrels per day10,000IndexNYMEX WTIWeighted average price per barrel:  Ceiling $67.00Floor $57.00Sold put$44.50Term (a)April-December 2015Three-way collars  Barrels per day10,000IndexNYMEX WTIWeighted average price per barrel:  Ceiling $71.81Floor $60.00Sold put$50.00TermJanuary-December 2016(a) Includes sold call options with weighted average price of $72.39 per barrel indexed to NYMEX WTI. If executed, the term of the call options would be for calendar year 2016 and the same volume as the underlying three-way collars.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this Report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2015. During the first quarter of 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.33MARATHON OIL CORPORATIONSupplemental Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31,(In millions)2015 2014Segment Income (Loss)   North America E&P$(161) $242International E&P23 221Oil Sands Mining(19) 64Segment income (loss)(157) 527Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes(119) (129)Income (loss) from continuing operations(276) 398Discontinued operations (a)— 751Net income (loss)$(276) $1,149Capital Expenditures (b)   North America E&P$933 $867International E&P146 105Oil Sands Mining21 68Corporate2 3Discontinued operations (a)— 110Total$1,102 $1,153Exploration Expenses   North America E&P$35 $57International E&P55 16Total$90 $73(a) As a result of the sale of our Angola assets and our Norway business, both are reflected as discontinued operations in 2014.
