Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Key Operating and Financial Activities     In the second quarter of 2012, notable items were:       ·    Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes of 407 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboed”), of which 66 percent was liquid hydrocarbons          ·    Net international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, for which average realizations have exceeded West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil, were 66 percent of total liquid hydrocarbon sales          ·    Production from Libya increased over the first quarter of 2012, with average net sales of 44 mboed and production available for sale of 44 mboed in the second quarter          ·    Bakken shale average net sales volumes of 27 mboed, a 69 percent increase over the same quarter of last year          ·    Eagle Ford shale average net sales volumes of 21 mboed, an increase nearly 50 percent from the first quarter of 2012          ·    Turnarounds at our operated assets in Equatorial Guinea and Norway were completed in less time and at lower cost than originally anticipated          ·    Signed a new production sharing contract for an exploration block adjacent to the Alba field offshore Equatorial Guinea          ·    Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of 21 percent          ·    Replaced existing revolving credit facility with a new $2.5 billion facility expiring April 2017      Some significant third quarter activities through August 3, 2012 include:       ·    Re-entered Gabon with a non-operated 21 percent working interest in an exploration license          ·    Agreed to pursue exploration activities in Kenya and Ethiopia          ·    Closed farm out agreements on 35 percent working interests in the Harir and Safen blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq          ·    Closed the largest previously announced acquisition in the Eagle Ford shale               18            Overview and Outlook     Exploration and Production     Production     Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales averaged 407 mboed during the second quarter and 395 mboed in the first six months of 2012 compared to 337 mboed and 368 mboed in the same periods of 2011. The resumption of sales from Libya in the first quarter of 2012 after production had ceased there in February of 2011 was the most significant cause of our increased sales volumes. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased in the U.S. for both the quarter and first six months of 2012, reflecting the impact of the Eagle Ford shale assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 and our ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Anadarko Woodford unconventional resource plays. In addition, net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from the U.K. were higher in the second quarter of 2012 than in the same period of 2011 due to the timing of liftings.     We continue to ramp up operations in the core of the Eagle Ford play in Texas where we had 20 operated rigs drilling and four hydraulic fracturing crews working as of June 30, 2012. During the second quarter and first six months of 2012, we drilled 61 gross and 107 gross wells, with a total of 72 gross (50 net) wells brought to sales in the first six months of 2012. We have realized significant efficiencies in drilling over the past few months, reducing the average drilling time per well to 23 days. With these gains in efficiencies, we believe we can reduce our operated rig count to 18 for the balance of 2012 and drill the 230 to 240 wells originally planned for 2012, along with 11 incremental wells associated with the acreage acquired on August 1, 2012.     To complement drilling and completion activity in the Eagle Ford shale, we continue to build infrastructure to support production growth across the operating area. Approximately 210 miles of gathering lines were installed in the first six months of 2012, while four new central gathering and treating facilities were commissioned. Five additional facilities are under construction. We are now able to transport approximately 70 percent of our Eagle Ford production by pipeline.      Average net sales volumes from the Bakken shale were 27 mboed and 26 mboed in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to 16 mboed and 15 mboed in the same periods of 2011. Our Bakken shale liquid hydrocarbon volumes average approximately 95 percent liquid hydrocarbons. During the second quarter and first six months of 2012, we drilled 26 gross and 47 gross wells, with a total of 44 gross (37 net) wells brought to sales in the first six months of 2012. We are reducing our operated rig count in the Bakken shale from eight to five in response to continued commodity price volatility and lower domestic liquid hydrocarbon prices. With this five-rig program, we expect to maintain our previously projected production levels over the next 12 to 18 months and to retain our core Bakken acreage.     In the Anadarko Woodford shale, net sales volumes averaged 6 mboed and 5 mboed during the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to 2 mboed and 1 mboed in the same periods of 2011. Recent performance improvements are being driven by results in the Knox area. During the second quarter of 2012, eight gross (five net) wells were brought to sales, with 17 gross (13 net) brought to sales in the first six months of 2012. In response to the continued decline in natural gas liquids prices and low natural gas prices, we are reducing our rig count in the Anadarko Woodford play from six to two. We expect to maintain our projected 2012 production level and retain our core acreage in the play with this two-rig program over the next 12 to 18 months.     Our Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico began production in December 2011. During the first quarter of 2012, production rates declined significantly and have remained below initial expectations. Accordingly, our reserve engineers performed an evaluation of our future production as well as our reserves which concluded in early April 2012. This resulted in a 2 mmboe reduction in proved reserves and a $261 million impairment charge in the first quarter of 2012.     In the first quarter 2011, production operations in Libya were suspended. In the fourth quarter of 2011, limited production resumed so that during the second quarter and first six months of 2012, net sales volumes averaged 44 mboed and 31 mboed. Some uncertainty concerning the sustainability of production and sales levels in Libya remains. We and our partners in the Waha concessions continue to assess the condition of our assets.     In June 2012, we submitted a plan for the development and operation of the Boyla field (PL 340) in the North Sea to the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. The Boyla field is located approximately 17 miles south of our operated Alvheim field. We hold a 65 percent working interest in the field. Pending approval, first production from Boyla is expected in the fourth quarter of 2014. Also during the second quarter of 2012, we completed a four-day turnaround in Norway that was originally scheduled for 14 days in the third quarter. We expect an additional one to two day planned shutdown of our Norway assets in the third quarter of 2012.     A 28-day turnaround began at our production operations in Equatorial Guinea on March 23, 2012. It was completed in April 2012, seven days ahead of schedule and below budget.            19          Exploration     At June 30, 2012, we were participating in two non-operated wells in the Gulf of Mexico: an appraisal well on the Gunflint discovery located on Mississippi Canyon Block 948 and an appraisal well on the Shenandoah prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 51. We have a 15 percent and a 10 percent working interest in these prospects. The Gunflint well has confirmed expected reservoir properties and continuity, establishing the commercial viability of the field. Drilling of the Shenandoah appraisal well commenced on June 29, 2012. During the second quarter of 2012, the well costs and related unproved property costs related to the Kilchurn well were charged to exploration expenses.     In the second half of 2012, we expect to return to drilling the exploration well on the Gulf of Mexico Innsbruck prospect on Mississippi Canyon Block 993 in which we hold a 45 percent working interest. Drilling of this well was halted in 2010 due to the U.S. government imposed drilling moratorium that followed the large Gulf of Mexico spill.     We continue exploratory drilling in Poland. Our third exploratory well has completed and a fourth well, is currently drilling. We have collected extensive data, including well logs and core samples, which are being evaluated. We plan to drill six wells by the end of 2012 in Poland. We hold a 51 percent working interest in 10 operated concessions and a 100 percent working interest in one concession.     In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, we began drilling our first operated exploration well on the Harir block on July 30, 2012 and plan to drill an exploration well on the Safen block in 2013. We have a 45 percent working (56 percent paying) interest in both the Harir and Safen blocks. Additionally, we are participating in non operated appraisal well on the Sarsang block, where we hold a 20 percent working (25 percent paying) interest.     During the first quarter of 2012, on the Birchwood oil sands lease located in Alberta, Canada, we conducted a seismic survey and drilled six water wells. We also submitted a regulatory application for a proposed 12 thousand barrel per day (“mbbld”) steam assisted gravity drainage (“SAGD”) project at Birchwood. Pending regulatory approval, project sanction is expected in 2014, with first oil projected in 2017. We have a 100 percent working interest in Birchwood.     Acquisitions and Divestitures     On January 3, 2012, we closed on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems for proceeds of $206 million. This includes our equity method interests in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and Odyssey Pipeline L.L.C., as well as certain other oil pipeline interests, including the Eugene Island pipeline system. A pretax gain of $166 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2012.     In April 2012, we entered multiple agreements to acquire approximately 20,000 net acres in the core of the Eagle Ford shale formation in transactions valued at $767 million, before closing adjustments. The smaller transactions closed during the second quarter of 2012. The largest transaction with a value of $750 million before closing adjustments closed on August 1, 2012. In addition to undeveloped acreage, at closing 17 gross operated and 9 gross non-operated wells were producing an average of 9 net mboed, of which 70 percent was liquid hydrocarbons.     In April 2012, we entered agreements to sell our Alaska assets. One transaction closed in the second quarter of 2012 with proceeds and a net gain of $7 million. The remaining transaction, with a value of $375 million before closing adjustments, is expected to close in the second half of 2012, pending regulatory approval and closing conditions.     In May 2012, we reached an agreement to relinquish operatorship of and our interests in the Bone Bay and Kumawa exploration licenses in Indonesia. A $36 million payment will be made upon government ratification of the agreement, to settle all of our obligations related to these licenses, including well commitments. This amount was accrued and reported as a loss on disposal of assets in the second quarter of 2012.     In June 2012, we entered an agreement to acquire a 21 percent working (25 percent paying) interest in the Diaba License G4-223 and its related permit in Gabon. The transaction is expected to close, subject to completion of the necessary Gabonese government and partner approvals, in the third quarter of 2012. The start of exploration drilling is expected in the first quarter of 2013.     During June 2012, we signed a new production sharing contract with the government of Equatorial Guinea for the exploration of Block A-12 offshore Bioko Island, located immediately west of our operated Alba Field. We have an 80 percent operated working interest in this block. Ratification of the contract by the government is expected in the third quarter of 2012.     In late July, we entered into an agreement to acquire positions in two onshore exploration blocks in northwest Kenya amounting to more than 11 million gross acres. The transaction includes a 50 percent working interest in Block 9 and a 15 percent working interest in Block 12A. An exploration well is planned on Block 9 in mid-2013. The transaction, subject to government approval, is expected to close in the third quarter of 2012. Additionally, we are pursuing exploration activities in Ethiopia, subject to host country government approval.     Also in late July, we closed on agreements to farm out 35 percent working (44 percent paying) interests in the Harir and Safen blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. After this transaction, we have a 45 percent working (56 percent paying) interest in each of the two blocks.         20            The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the expected production in the Eagle Ford, Anadarko Woodford and Bakken plays, timing of first production from the Boyla field, anticipated drilling rig and drilling activity, the sale of the our Alaska assets, the expected closing of agreements in Gabon and Kenya, possible exploration activity in Ethiopia, a new production sharing contract with the Government of Equatorial Guinea, a scheduled shutdown of the Norway assets and the timing of the commencement of construction and first oil on the SAGD project. Factors that could potentially affect the expected production in the Eagle Ford, Anadarko Woodford and Bakken plays, timing of first production from the Boyla field, and anticipated drilling rig and drilling activity include pricing, supply and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The completion of the sale of our Alaska assets is subject to necessary government and regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The agreement in Gabon is subject to government and partner approvals. The agreement in Kenya and the exploration activity in Ethiopia are subject to government approvals. The new production sharing contract with the Government of Equatorial Guinea is subject to ratification by the Equatorial Guinea government. The scheduled shutdown of the Norway assets is based on current expectations, estimates and projections and is not a guarantee of future performance. The timing of commencement of construction and first oil on the SAGD project can be affected by delays in obtaining and conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, board approval, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and the other risks associated with construction projects. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the our control and difficult to predict. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.     Oil Sands Mining   Our OSM operations consist of a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”). Our net synthetic crude oil sales were 44 mbbld in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to 41 mbbld and 39 mbbld in the same periods of 2011. The upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011 and subsequent periods’ sales volumes have increased as a result.   With production capacity at the AOSP now at 255,000 gross barrels per day, the focus will be on improving operating efficiencies and adding capacity through debottlenecking.     In July 2012, Alberta’s primary energy regulator, the Energy and Resources Conservation Board (“ERCB”), conditionally approved the AOSP’s Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (“Quest”) project. The ERCB’s approval positions the AOSP partners to make an investment decision on Quest in 2012.     The above discussion contains forward looking statements with regard to the Quest project. The project is subject to regulatory approvals, stakeholder engagement, detailed engineering studies and a final joint venture partner agreement.     Integrated Gas     LNG and methanol sales from Equatorial Guinea are conducted through equity method investees that purchase dry gas from our E&P assets in Equatorial Guinea. Our share of LNG sales totaled 5,467 metric tonnes per day (“mtd”) for the second quarter and 5,879 mtd for the first six months of 2012 compared to 6,614 mtd and 7,215 mtd in the same periods of 2011. LNG sales volumes are below the prior year primarily because the second quarter and first six months of 2011 also included LNG sales from Alaska, which ceased when our interest in that production facility was sold in the third quarter of 2011. Also, the planned turnaround which began at the LNG facility in Equatorial Guinea in the first quarter of 2012 was completed in the second quarter four days ahead of schedule and 15 percent under budget.              21              Market Conditions   Exploration and Production   Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011.             Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,      Benchmark       2012       2011       2012       2011      WTI crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 93.35     $ 102.34     $ 98.15     $ 98.50     Brent (Europe) crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 108.42     $ 117.36     $ 113.45     $ 111.16     Henry Hub natural gas (Dollars per million British thermal units ("mmbtu"))(a)     $ 2.22     $ 4.31     $ 2.48     $ 4.21         (a)    Settlement date average.        Average WTI crude oil benchmark prices decreased in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter of 2011, but were relatively flat for the first six months of each year. The average differential between the Brent and WTI benchmarks was a premium of approximately $15 per barrel in both periods of 2012. Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and a majority is sold in relation to the Brent crude oil benchmark.     Our domestic crude oil production was about 42 percent sour in the second quarter and 45 percent sour in the first six months of 2012 compared to 68 percent and 69 percent in the same periods of 2011. Reduced production from the Gulf of Mexico and increased onshore production from the Bakken and Eagle Ford shales contributed to the lower sour crude percentage in 2012. Sour crude oil contains more sulfur than light sweet WTI. Sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of its higher refining costs and lower refined product values.     A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Average Henry Hub settlement prices for natural gas were lower for the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of the prior year. A decline in average settlement date Henry Hub natural gas prices began in September 2011 and continued into the second quarter of 2012. Should U.S. natural gas prices remain depressed, impairment charges related to our natural gas assets may be necessary.     Our other major natural gas-producing regions are Europe and Equatorial Guinea. Natural gas prices in Europe have been higher than in the U.S. in recent periods. In the case of Equatorial Guinea, our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. The natural gas sales from Equatorial Guinea are at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average natural gas realized prices may not fully track market price movements.     Oil Sands Mining   OSM segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce. Roughly two-thirds of our normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil market, primarily Western Canadian Select (“WCS”). Recently, the WCS discount from WTI has increased, bringing down our average price realizations. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader.     The operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime, making per unit costs sensitive to production rate. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively.     The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the second quarter and first six months of 2012 and 2011:             Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,      Benchmark       2012       2011       2012       2011     WTI crude oil (Dollars per barrel) $ 93.35     $ 102.34     $ 98.15     $ 98.50    Western Canadian Select (Dollars per barrel)(a)   $ 70.63     $ 84.92     $ 76.07     $ 78.08      AECO natural gas sales index (Dollars per mmbtu)(b)      $ 1.84     $ 4.04     $ 2.04     $ 3.94           (a)    Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada.        (b)    Monthly average AECO day ahead index.                    22         Integrated Gas     We have a 60 percent ownership in a production facility in Equatorial Guinea, which sells LNG under a long-term contract principally based upon Henry Hub natural gas prices.     We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Equatorial Guinea. Methanol demand has a direct impact on the plant’s earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. The plant capacity of 1.1 million tonnes is about 2 percent of 2011 estimated world demand.     Results of Operations     Consolidated Results of Operation     Due to the spin-off of our downstream business on June 30, 2011, which is reported as discontinued operations, income from continuing operations is more representative of Marathon Oil as an independent energy company. Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes in the second quarter of 2012 was 55 percent higher than in the same period of 2011 primarily due to the previously discussed resumption of our operations in Libya and no impairments in the second quarter of 2012. The effective tax rate was 72 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 67 percent in the second quarter of 2011, with the increase related to higher income from continuing operations in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily Norway and Libya.     Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes in the first six months of 2012 was 45 percent higher than in the same period of 2011 primarily due to increased income in Libya and lower exploration expenses, depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) and impairments. As a result of increased income from continuing operations before tax in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily Norway and Libya, the effective tax rate was 71 percent for the first six months of 2012 compared to 60 percent for the same period of 2011.     Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table:           Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,      (In millions)     2012       2011       2012       2011      E&P    $ 3,396     $ 3,249     $ 6,808     $ 6,576     OSM      335       447       714       753     IG      -       13       -       77      Segment revenues      3,731       3,709       7,522       7,406     Elimination of intersegment revenues      -       (15 )     -       (41 )    Total revenues    $ 3,731     $ 3,694     $ 7,522     $ 7,365       E&P segment revenues increased $147 million in the second quarter and $232 million in the first six months of 2012 from the comparable prior-year periods. Included in our E&P segment are supply optimization activities which include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. Supply optimization serves to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. See the Cost of revenues discussion as revenues from supply optimization approximate the related costs. Lower average commodity prices in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 decreased revenues related to supply optimization.     Revenues from the sale of our U.S. production are higher in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 primarily as a result of increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from our U.S. shale plays. Lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas price realizations partially offset the volume impact. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our U.S. operations.           Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,          2012       2011       2012       2011      United States Operating Statistics                             Net liquid hydrocarbon sales (mbbld) (a)      93       72       91       75      Liquid hydrocarbon average realizations (per bbl) (b)    $ 84.40     $ 99.51     $ 88.94     $ 92.76                                         Net natural gas sales (mmcfd)      319       315       331       341      Natural gas average realizations (per mcf)(b)    $ 3.42     $ 5.08     $ 3.79     $ 5.12         (a)    Includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.        (b)    Excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments.             23              Revenues from our international operations are higher in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 primarily as a result of the, previously discussed, resumption of liquid hydrocarbon sales from Libya. Higher average liquid hydrocarbon realizations during the first six months of 2012 also contributed to the revenue increase for that period. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our international operations.

OSM segment revenues decreased $112 million in the second quarter and $39 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. Net sales volumes improved in both periods of 2012 compared to the prior year because the upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. However, lower WTI prices and an increase in the discount of WCS to WTI resulted in the 21 percent and 9 percent decreases in average realizations during the second quarter and first six months of 2012. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our OSM operations.

IG segment revenues decreased $13 million in the second quarter and $77 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. Sales of LNG from our Alaska operations ceased in the third quarter of 2011 when we sold our interest in this production facility.     Income from equity method investments decreased $60 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $99 million in the first six months of 2012 from the comparable prior-year periods. Lower commodity prices negatively impacted the earnings of our equity method investees.     Net gain (loss) on disposal of assets in the second quarter of 2012 primarily reflects $36 million to settle all of our obligations, including well commitments, as a result of the assignment of our Bone Bay and Kumawa exploration licenses in Indonesia. The net gain on disposal of assets in the first six months of 2012 was primarily the $166 million gain on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems, reduced by the second quarter Indonesia loss. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.            24            Cost of revenues decreased $365 million and $362 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 from the comparable periods of 2011 primarily due to the impact of lower commodity prices on our supply optimization activities. Comparatively, costs related to supply optimization were lower by $276 million for the second quarter and by $239 million for the first six months of 2012. OSM segment costs decreased in both periods of 2012 because the second quarter of 2011 included a $64 million accrual for estimated net costs to address water flow in a previously mined and contained area of the Muskeg River mine Additionally, Integrated Gas segment costs are lower in 2012 due to the sale of our interest in the Alaska LNG facility in the third quarter of 2011.     Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $16 million in the second quarter and decreased $45 million in the first six months of 2012 from the comparable prior-year periods. Because both our E&P and OSM segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, the previously discussed increases or decreases in sales volumes generally result in similar changes in DD&A. The DD&A rate (expense per barrel of oil equivalent), which is impacted by changes in reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes in our DD&A. Lower U.S. DD&A rates in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 offset the impact of higher sales volumes in those periods. Also, there was no depletion of our Alaska assets in the second quarter of 2012 because they are held for sale. The following table provides DD&A rates for our E&P and OSM segments.

Impairments in the first six months of 2011 related primarily to the Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico and an intangible asset for an LNG delivery contract at Elba Island. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these impairments.     General and administrative expenses were flat in the second quarter and decreased $17 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011. The first six months of 2011 included higher incentive compensation expense due to the increase in Marathon’s stock price in the period leading up to the spin-off.     Exploration expenses were higher in the second quarter of 2012 than in the same quarter of 2011, primarily due to higher dry well costs and unproved property impairments. Dry well costs in the second quarter of 2012 included one dry well in the Gulf of Mexico and a few domestic onshore dry wells, while the second quarter of 2011 included dry well costs in Norway and Indonesia. Exploration expenses were lower in the first six months of 2012 than in the previous year, primarily due to dry well costs in the Gulf of Mexico and Indonesia in the first quarter of 2011; however, higher unproved property impairments in the Marcellus shale and Indonesia in 2012 partially offset this decrease. Geological and geophysical (“G&G”) costs increased in both periods of 2012 primarily related to the Eagle Ford shale play, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the seismic survey on our Birchwood oil sands in-situ lease. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses.

See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these transactions.     Net interest and other increased $44 million and $75 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 from the comparable periods of 2011 primarily due to lower capitalized interest in both periods.     Provision for income taxes increased $408 million and $799 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 from the comparable periods of 2011 primarily due to the increase in pretax income in high tax rate jurisdictions, including the impact of the previously discussed resumption of sales in Libya in the first quarter of 2012.     The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in “Corporate and other unallocated items” in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.            25            Our effective tax rate in the first six months of 2012 was 71 percent. This rate is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings from foreign jurisdictions, primarily Norway and Libya, where the tax rates are in excess of the U.S. statutory rate. An increase in earnings and associated taxes from foreign jurisdictions, primarily Norway, as compared to prior periods caused an increase in our valuation allowance on current year foreign tax credits. In Libya, where the statutory tax rate is in excess of 90 percent, limited production resumed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and liquid hydrocarbon sales resumed in the first quarter of 2012. A reliable estimate of 2012 annual ordinary income from our Libyan operations cannot be made and the range of possible scenarios when including ordinary income from our Libyan operations in the worldwide annual effective tax rate calculation demonstrates significant variability. As such, for the first six months of 2012, an estimated annual effective tax rate was calculated excluding Libya and applied to consolidated ordinary income excluding Libya and the tax provision applicable to Libyan ordinary income was recorded as a discrete item in the period. Excluding Libya, the effective tax rate would be 64 percent for the first six months of 2012.     Our effective tax rate in the first six months of 2011 was 60 percent which is higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings from foreign jurisdictions where the tax rates are in excess of the U.S. statutory rate and the valuation allowance recorded against 2011 foreign tax credits. In addition, in the second quarter of 2011 we recorded a deferred tax charge related to an internal restructuring of our international subsidiaries.     Discontinued operations reflect the June 30, 2011 spin-off of our downstream business and the historical results of those operations, net of tax, for all periods presented.     Segment Results     Segment income is summarized in the following table.

The income decrease in the second quarter of 2012 was primarily the result of lower liquid hydrocarbon price realizations and increased exploration expenses, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. For the six-month period, the increase in liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and decreased DD&A were partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon realizations and increased exploration expenses.     International E&P income decreased $128 million in the second quarter and $397 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. As previously discussed, increased income before tax in higher tax jurisdictions resulted in a higher effective tax rate in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. Segment income, before taxes, increased in both periods primarily due to the previously discussed higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and lower exploration expenses in both periods. Higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations also had a favorable impact on income for the first six months of 2012.     OSM segment income decreased $18 million and $9 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2012. As previously discussed, lower synthetic crude oil price realizations were the primary reason for the decrease in income. This was partially offset by decreased costs and higher sales volumes.         26           IG segment income decreased $30 million and $86 million in the second quarter of 2012 and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011 primarily as a result of weaker natural gas prices in 2012 and lower LNG sales volumes due to the sale of our interest in the Alaska LNG facility in the third quarter of 2011.     Cash Flows and Liquidity     Cash Flows     Net cash provided by continuing operations was $1,742 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to $3,320 million in the first six months of 2011 primarily reflecting the impact of lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices on operating income and higher cash tax payments. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for amounts of the cash tax payments.     Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,001 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to $1,380 million related to continuing operations in the first six months of 2011. Significant investing activities are additions to property, plant and equipment and disposal of assets. In the first six months of 2012, most of the additions were in the E&P segment with continued spending on U.S. unconventional resource plays, particularly the Eagle Ford shale. This compares to additions in the first six months of 2011 which also included spending on U.S. unconventional resource plays, though at a lower level, and drilling in Norway, Indonesia and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. Deposits totaling $100 million were paid in the first six months of 2011 related to the Eagle Ford shale acreage acquisitions that closed later that year.      For further information regarding capital expenditures by segment, see Supplemental Statistics.     Net cash provided by financing activities was $210 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to net cash used in financing activities related to continuing operations of $4,695 million in the first six months of 2011. During the first six months of 2012, we drew a net $550 million under our commercial paper program, retired $23 million principal amount of debt before it was due and repaid $88 million of debt upon its maturity. During the first six months of 2011, we retired $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our debt before it was due and distributed $1.6 billion to Marathon Petroleum Corporation in connection with the spin-off of the downstream business. Dividends paid were a significant use of cash in both periods.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, the issuance of notes, our committed revolving credit facility, and sales of non-strategic assets. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements. We issued $4.3 billion and repaid $3.7 billion of commercial paper in the first six months of 2012 leaving a balance of $550 million outstanding at June 30, 2012. After June 30, 2012, we continued to utilize our sources of liquidity, including additional issuances of commercial paper, to fund the Eagle Ford acquisition that closed on August 1, 2012 and working capital requirements. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.   Capital Resources     At June 30, 2012, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility, described below, and $550 million in commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility.     In April 2012, we terminated our $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new $2.5 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility matures in April 2017 but allows us to request two one-year extensions. It contains an option to increase the commitment amount by up to an additional $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of any increasing lenders, and includes sub-facilities for swing-line loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $100 million and $500 million, respectively. Fees on the unused commitment of each lender range from 10 basis points to 25 basis points per year depending on our credit ratings. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (a) an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin ranging from 87.5 basis points to 162.5 basis points per year depending on our credit ratings or (b) the Base Rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0 basis points to 62.5 basis points depending on our credit ratings. Base Rate is defined as a per annum rate equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus one-half of one percent and (c) LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1 percent.     The agreement contains a covenant that requires our ratio of total debt to total capitalization not to exceed 65 percent as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. If an event of default occurs, the lenders may terminate the commitments under the Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility.           27         We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.     Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 21 percent at June 30, 2012, compared to 20 percent at December 31, 2011.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the transaction valued at $750 million to acquire additional Eagle Ford shale assets was closed on August 1, 2012.     In the first quarter of 2012, we increased our 2012 capital, investment and exploration budget, excluding acquisition costs, from $4.8 billion to $5.0 billion, of which $4.6 billion will be used for capital expenditures. The increase reflects development plans for the additional acreage being acquired in the Eagle Ford shale and other adjustments.     As of June 30, 2012 we expected to make additional contributions to our funded pension plans up to an estimated $50 million over the remainder of 2012. We made a contribution of $14 million in July 2012.     Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The above discussions also contain forward-looking statements about our 2012 capital, investment and exploration budget and expected contributions to our funded pension plans. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production and mining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.            28            Contractual Cash Obligations     The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated contractual cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of June 30, 2012.              2013-       2015-      Later      (In millions)     Total       2012        2014       2016      Years      Short and long-term debt (excludes interest)    $ 5,202     $ 584     $ 249     $ 68     $ 4,301     Lease obligations      272       45       74       54       99     Purchase obligations:                                            Oil and gas activities(a)      1,053       550       381       43       79     Service and materials contracts(b)      992       84       229       152       527     Transportation and related contracts      1,258       162       255       158       683     Drilling rigs and fracturing crews      1,272       397       851       24       -     Other      215       41       90       27       57      Total purchase obligations      4,790       1,234       1,806       404       1,346     Other long-term liabilities reported                                             in the consolidated balance sheet(c)      1,163       95       272       253       543     Total contractual cash obligations(d)    $ 11,427     $ 1,958     $ 2,401     $ 779     $ 6,289         (a)   Oil and gas activities include contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment and commitments for oil and gas exploration such as costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately.        (b)   Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.        (c)   Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2021. Also includes amounts for uncertain tax positions.         (d)   This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1,489 million.           Critical Accounting Estimates     There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates subsequent to December 31, 2011.     Environmental Matters     We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes.     There have been no significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2011.     Other Contingencies     We are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.      Litigation – In March 2011, Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (“Noble”) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Harris County, Texas alleging, among other things, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent misrepresentation, relating to a multi-year drilling contract for a newly constructed drilling rig to be deployed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We filed an answer in April 2011, contending, among other things, failure to perform, failure to comply with material obligations, failure to mitigate alleged damages and that Noble failed to provide the rig according to the operating, performance and safety requirements specified in the drilling contract. Noble is seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are vigorously defending this litigation. The ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, including any financial effect on us, remains uncertain. We do not believe an estimate of a reasonably probable loss (or range of loss) can be made for this lawsuit at this time.           29           Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Disclosures about how derivatives are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how the fair values of our derivative instruments are measured may be found in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.     Sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2012 is provided in the following table.               Incremental              Change in      (In millions)    Fair Value     Fair Value      Financial assets (liabilities): (a)                   Interest rate swap agreements    $ 16 (b)   $ 5      Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year    $ (5,447 )(b)   $ (220 )       (a)   Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, notes payable, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.        (b)   Fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.        The aggregate cash flow effect on foreign currency derivative contracts of a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates at June 30, 2012 would be $55 million.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures     An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarter ended June 30, 2012, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.            30        MARATHON OIL CORPORATION  Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited)                                                   Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended          June 30,       June 30,      (In millions)     2012       2011       2012       2011      Segment Income                                     Exploration and Production                                     United States    $ 70     $ 126     $ 179     $ 157      International      347       475       715       1,112      E&P segment      417       601       894       1,269      Oil Sands Mining      51       69       92       101      Integrated Gas      13       43       17       103      Segment income      481       713       1,003       1,473      Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes      (88 )     (415 )     (193 )     (720 )    Income from continuing operations      393       298       810       753      Discontinued operations(a)      -       698       -       1,239      Net income    $ 393     $ 996     $ 810     $ 1,992     Capital Expenditures(b)                                     Exploration and Production                                     United States    $ 983     $ 556     $ 1,845     $ 905      International      201       193       340       512      E&P segment      1,184       749       2,185       1,417      Oil Sands Mining      43       80       95       200      Integrated Gas       1       -       1       1      Corporate      17       24       59       30      Total    $ 1,245     $ 853     $ 2,340     $ 1,648     Exploration Expenses                                     United States    $ 144     $ 54     $ 237     $ 204      International      29       91       78       171      Total    $ 173     $ 145     $ 315     $ 375          (a)    The spin-off of our downstream business was completed on June 30, 2011, and has been reported as discontinued operations in 2011.

Legal Proceedings     We are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims.

There have been no significant changes in legal or environmental proceedings during the first six months of 2012.       Item 1A. Risk Factors     We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A.
