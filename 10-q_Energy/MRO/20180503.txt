Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us.Capital ResourcesCredit Arrangements and BorrowingsAt March 31, 2018, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility. At March 31, 2018, we had $5.5 billion in long-term debt outstanding, with our next debt maturity in the amount of $600 million due in 2020. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Asset DisposalIn the third quarter of 2017, we entered into agreements to sell certain non-core properties in our International E&P segment for combined proceeds of $53 million, before closing adjustments. We have closed on one of the asset sales in 2017, and we expect the remaining asset sale to close during 2018.Debt-To-Capital RatioThe Credit Facility includes a covenant requiring that our ratio of total debt to total capitalization not exceed 65% as of the last day of the fiscal quarter. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 31% at March 31, 2018, compared to 32% at December 31, 2017.

As of March 31, 2018, we plan to make contributions of up to $36 million to our funded pension plans during the remainder of 2018. Contractual Cash ObligationsAs of March 31, 2018, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Environmental Matters and Other ContingenciesWe have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected.We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There have been no significant changes to our environmental matters and other contingencies subsequent to December 31, 2017. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies.Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation statements regarding our future performance, business strategy, reserve estimates, asset quality, production guidance, drilling plans, capital plans, cost and expense estimates, asset acquisitions and dispositions, future financial position and other plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “intend," “may,” “plan,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” or similar words may be used to identify forward-looking statements; however, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. While we believe our assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from those projected, including, but not limited to: •conditions in the oil and gas industry, including supply and demand levels for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas and the resulting impact on price;•changes in expected reserve or production levels; •changes in political and economic conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, and global and domestic market conditions; •risks related to our hedging activities;•capital available for exploration and development; •the inability of any party to satisfy closing conditions with respect to our asset acquisitions and dispositions;•drilling and operating risks;•well production timing; •availability of drilling rigs, materials and labor, including the costs associated therewith; •difficulty in obtaining necessary approvals and permits; •non-performance by third parties of contractual obligations; •unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto;•cyber-attacks;•changes in safety, health, environmental, tax and other regulations; •other geological, operating and economic considerations; and•the risk factors, forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. 35All forward-looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us on the date of this report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 36Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements include additional disclosures regarding our open derivative positions, including underlying notional quantities, how they are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how their fair values are measured.Commodity Price Risk During the first three months of 2018, we entered into crude oil and natural gas derivatives, indexed to NYMEX WTI and Henry Hub, related to a portion of our forecasted United States E&P sales.

Our sensitivity to interest rate movements and corresponding changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt portfolio affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices different than carrying value. Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates on our financial assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2018, is provided in the following table.

Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(b) Fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities. (c) Excludes capital leases. Counterparty Risk We are also exposed to financial risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. If commodity prices fall below current levels, some of our counterparties may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. We review the creditworthiness of counterparties and use master netting agreements when appropriate.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this Report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2018. During the first three months of 2018, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.38Part II – OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal Proceedings We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims.

See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I for a description of such legal and administrative proceedings.Item 1A.
