Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Overview and Outlook  Exploration and Production  Production   Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales averaged 361 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”) during the first quarter of 2010 compared to 393 mboped in the same quarter of 2009. This decrease in sales volumes from the prior year was primarily the result of a planned turnaround in Equatorial Guinea, the sale of a portion of our Permian Basin assets in the second quarter of 2009 and normal production declines. Our operations in Equatorial Guinea were not producing for a portion of the first quarter due to a planned turnaround at our production facilities.     Our net liquid hydrocarbon sales in North Dakota from the Bakken Shale resource play have increased to 11,000 barrels per day (“bpd”) in first quarter 2010 compared to 8,500 bpd in the same quarter of last year. Development of the Bakken Shale play is part of our targeted expansion into key North America resource plays.     In the Gulf of Mexico, the Droshky development located on Green Canyon Block 244, in which we hold a 100 percent working interest, remains on schedule for first production in mid-2010. We have completed all four of its development wells and are awaiting modification of the third-party Bullwinkle platform. The Droshky project is currently expected to cost less than $1 billion, down from the original $1.3 billion budget.   Exploration   The budget for our 2010 global exploration drilling program is $1 billion. We plan to drill three or four significant wells in the deepwater area of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as two potentially high-reward, but high-risk wells in deepwater offshore Indonesia. Additionally, we anticipate drilling or participating in approximately 20 to 30 wells in emerging North America resource plays.         In December 2009, we began drilling the Flying Dutchman prospect, located on Green Canyon Block 511 in the Gulf of Mexico. The Flying Dutchman reached its targeted total depth in early May 2010. The well encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands in an Upper Miocene that will require further technical evaluation. During the second quarter of 2010, we anticipate expensing approximately $45 million for drilling costs incurred below the depth of the hydrocarbon-bearing sands. The results of the Flying Dutchman well will be evaluated along with additional potential drilling on Green Canyon Block 511 to determine overall commerciality. As a result, approximately $90 million of exploratory well costs will be suspended while we evaluate the results. We are the operator and will have a 63 percent working interest in this prospect.         19     Index     We commenced drilling the Innsbruck prospect, located on Mississippi Canyon Block 993 in April 2010 and expect it to reach total depth in the third quarter of 2010 for a total cost of about $115 million. We are the operator and hold an 85 percent working interest in the prospect.     In Indonesia, we expect to spud a deepwater well in the Pasangkayu block mid-2010. We are the operator and hold a 70 percent working interest in the Pasangkayu block.      We submitted apparent high bids totaling $24 million on five blocks offered in the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale No. 213 conducted by the Minerals Management Service in the first quarter of 2010. Four blocks are 100 percent Marathon, and the remaining block was bid with partners. The acreage will build on our strong positions in the Miocene and Lower Tertiary deepwater plays.     We were awarded three additional onshore exploration licenses in Poland with shale gas potential during the first quarter of 2010, and another in April, bringing our total number of licenses to seven and increasing our total acreage position to approximately 1.4 million net acres. We have a 100 percent interest and operate all seven blocks. We continue to pursue additional licenses and plan to begin geologic studies in Poland in 2010.     Divestitures     During the first quarter 2010, we closed the sale of a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola. We received net proceeds of $1.3 billion and recorded a pretax gain on the sale in the amount of $811 million. We retained a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32.     The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of future production, anticipated future exploratory drilling activity and exploration spending. The exploration spending budget is based on current expectations, estimates and projections and is not a guarantee of future performance. Some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.     Oil Sands Mining   Our net synthetic crude oil sales were 25 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 32 mbpd in the same quarter of 2009, reflecting the impact of a planned turnaround at the mine and upgrader that began March 22, 2010 and a buildup of bitumen required for the AOSP Expansion 1. Sales in the second quarter of 2010 will also be impacted by the turnaround, with production anticipated to be completely shutdown in April with a staged startup of operations commencing in May 2010. The turnaround is expected to cost approximately $85 million to $120 million, net to our ownership. We have incurred $30 million during the first quarter of 2010.   The AOSP Expansion 1 is on track and anticipated to begin mine operations in the second half of 2010, and upgrader operations in late 2010 or early 2011. Expansion 1 includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the Jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing Muskeg River mine, expansion of the Scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure. We hold a 20 percent working interest in the AOSP.     The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the start of operations of AOSP Expansion 1 and the start up of operations coming out of the turnaround. Factors that could affect the project are transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.   Integrated Gas   Our share of LNG sales worldwide totaled 5,792 metric tonnes per day (“mtpd”) for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 6,769 mtpd in the first quarter of 2009. These LNG sales volumes include both consolidated sales volumes and our share of the sales volumes of equity method investees. LNG sales from Alaska are conducted through a consolidated subsidiary. LNG and methanol sales from Equatorial Guinea are conducted through equity method investees that purchase dry gas from our E&P assets in Equatorial Guinea. Despite a planned turnaround at the Equatorial Guinea gas production facilities, which significantly reduced natural gas volumes to the LNG and methanol facilities during the quarter, we took advantage of higher LNG and methanol prices through the sale of inventories.   Refining, Marketing and Transportation   Our total refinery throughputs were 3 percent higher in the first quarter of 2010 than in the first quarter of 2009. Crude oil refined increased 18 percent for the same periods, primarily related to the startup of the Garyville, Louisiana,        20     Index   expansion, while other charge and blendstocks decreased 56 percent. The throughput decline in other charge and blendstocks is primarily a result of the turnarounds we completed at both the Garyville and the Texas City, Texas, refineries in the first quarter of 2010. We also initiated a turnaround at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery in the first quarter of 2010 which was completed in April 2010. Such activity in 2010 compares to turnarounds at our Catlettsburg and Robinson, Illinois, refineries in the first quarter of 2009.     The refinery units completed as part of the expansion at Garyville have now been fully integrated into the Garyville refinery and are operating as expected. The 180,000 bpd expansion establishes the Garyville facility as the fourth-largest U.S. refinery with a crude oil capacity of 436,000 bpd.     Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline increased to an average of 63 mbpd in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 55 mbpd in the same period of 2009. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of ethanol supply and government regulations.     First quarter 2010 Speedway SuperAmerica LLC same store gasoline sales volume were about the same when compared to the first quarter of 2009 while same store merchandise sales increased 7 percent for the same period. During the first quarter, Speedway was ranked the nation’s top retail gasoline brand for the second consecutive year, according to the 2010 EquiTrend® Brand Study conducted by Harris Interactive®.     As of March 31, 2010, the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan, refinery was approximately 35 percent complete and on schedule for an expected completion in the second half of 2012.     The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the Detroit refinery project. Factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.     Other   On April 22, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, a rig that was engaged in drilling operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, sank after an explosion and fire. The incident resulted in a significant and uncontrolled oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. We have no ownership interest in those operations or any adjacent interests. However, we do have significant exploration and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, including deepwater areas. Also, we have an interest in an offshore oil port in the Gulf of Mexico and significant portions of the crude oil supplied to our refineries must be transported through the Gulf. At this time, the Deepwater Horizon incident is having no significant effect on our operations in the Gulf of Mexico. However, we cannot predict what, if any, ultimate impact the Deepwater Horizon incident will have on us.   Market Conditions  Exploration and Production   Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists the benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages in the first quarter in 2010, when compared to the same period in 2009.           Three Months Ended March 31,          2010       2009      West Texas Intermediate crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 78.88     $ 43.31     Brent crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 76.36     $ 44.46     Henry Hub natural gas (Dollars per mmbtu)(a)    $ 5.30     $ 4.91           (a)   First-of-month price index.       While crude oil prices did not vary significantly within the first three months of 2010, the quarterly average for the first quarter of 2010 was significantly higher compared to the first quarter in 2009.     Our domestic crude oil production is about 62 percent sour, which means that it contains more sulfur than light sweet WTI does. Sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of its higher refining costs and lower refined product values. Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the Dated Brent crude oil benchmark.     Natural gas prices for the first quarter of 2010 were slightly higher compared to the same quarter in prior year. A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Our other major natural gas-producing region is Equatorial        21     Index     Guinea, where large portions of our natural gas sales is subject to term contracts, making realized prices in this area less volatile. As we sell larger quantities of natural gas from these regions, to the extent that these fixed prices are lower than prevailing prices, our reported average natural gas prices realizations may decrease.   Oil Sands Mining   OSM segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce. Roughly two-thirds of our normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil market, primarily Western Canadian Select. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader.     The operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per unit costs are sensitive to production rate. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian AECO natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively.     The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the first quarter of 2010 compared to first quarter of 2009.           Three Months Ended March 31,      Benchmark     2010       2009      WTI crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 78.88     $ 43.31     Western Canadian Select (Dollars per barrel)(a)    $ 69.67     $ 34.15     AECO natural gas sales index (Canadian dollars per gigajoule)(b)      4.73       4.72           (a)    Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada.          (b)    Alberta Energy Company day ahead index.      Integrated Gas     Our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, primarily in the U.S., Europe and West Africa.     Our most significant LNG investment is our 60 percent ownership in a production facility in Equatorial Guinea, which sells LNG under a long-term contract at prices tied to Henry Hub natural gas prices. In general, LNG delivered to the U.S. is tied to Henry Hub prices and will track with changes in U.S. natural gas prices, while LNG sold in Europe and Asia is indexed to crude oil prices and will track the movement of those prices.     We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Equatorial Guinea through our investment in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”). Methanol demand has a direct impact on AMPCO’s earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. AMPCO’s plant capacity is 1.1 million tonnes, or 3 percent of estimated 2009 world demand.     Refining, Marketing and Transportation     RM&T segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, refinery throughputs and retail marketing gross margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise.     Our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads that we feel most closely track our operations and slate of products. Posted Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of crude oil refined into 3 barrels of gasoline, 2 barrels of distillate and 1 barrel of residual fuel) are used for the crack spread calculation.     Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly causing our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin to differ from the crack spreads which are based upon sweet crude. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin.         22     Index    In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads and sweet/sour differential, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:       ·    the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed,          ·    the selling prices realized for refined products,          ·    the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to manage price risk,          ·    the cost of products purchased for resale, and           ·    changes in manufacturing costs, which include depreciation, energy used by our refineries and the level of maintenance costs.        The following table lists calculated average crack spreads for the Midwest and Gulf Coast markets and the sweet/sour differential for the first quarters of 2010 and 2009:           Three Months Ended March 31,      (Dollars per barrel)     2010       2009      Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread    $ 2.68     $ 2.91     U.S. Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread    $ 3.50     $ 2.89     Sweet/Sour differential(a)    $ 5.23     $ 7.28           (a)     Calculated using the following mix of crude types: 15% Arab Light, 20% Kuwait, 10% Maya, 15% Western Canadian Select and 40% Mars compared to WTI.        Even though the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread was similar and sour crude accounted for 52 percent of sour crude oil processed in the first quarters of 2010 and 2009, the economic benefit that we recognized from processing sour crude was lower in 2010. The sweet/sour differential narrowed 28 percent in the first quarter of 2010 relative to the same quarter of 2009.     Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the cost of refined products, including secondary transportation and consumer excise taxes, also impacts RM&T segment profitability. There are numerous factors including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions that impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year. The gross margin on merchandise sold at retail outlets has been historically less volatile.         23     Index   Results of Operations   Consolidated Results of Operations     Consolidated net income in the first quarter of 2010 was 62 percent higher than in the same quarter of 2009. Increasing liquid hydrocarbon prices contributed to the income increase, as did the gain on our sale of 20 percent of Angola Block 32. However, costs were higher in the first quarter of 2010 due to an E&P segment long-lived asset impairment and turnarounds of varying size in every business segment.                         Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table:                         Three Months Ended March 31,      (In millions)     2010       2009      E&P    $ 2,521     $ 1,440     OSM      165       122     IG      27       11     RM&T      13,362       8,674      Segment revenues      16,075       10,247     Elimination of intersegment revenues      (206 )     (153 )   Gain on U.K. natural gas contracts      -       82       Total revenues    $ 15,869     $ 10,176                        Items included in both revenues and costs and expenses:                     Consumer excise taxes on petroleum products and merchandise    $ 1,212     $ 1,174        E&P segment revenues increased $1,081 million in the first quarter of 2010 from the comparable prior-year period primarily a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas price realizations. Liquid hydrocarbon realizations averaged $74.35 per barrel in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $40.20 in the first quarter of 2009, while natural gas realizations averaged $3.31 and $2.82 per mcf in the same periods. Revenues included gains on derivatives of $51 million in the first quarter of 2010, of which $30 million were unrealized.     Net sales volumes during the quarter averaged 361 mboepd, compared to 393 mboepd for the same period last year. This 8 percent decrease in sales volumes reflects the liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production declines previously discussed.     For the first quarter of 2009, losses of $82 million were excluded from E&P segment revenues related to natural gas sales contracts in the U.K. that are accounted for as derivative instruments. Those contracts expired in 2009.   The tables on the following page report E&P segment realizations and sales volumes in greater detail for both quarters.           24     Index                            Three Months Ended March 31,          2010       2009                     E&P Operating Statistics                 Net Liquid Hydrocarbon Sales (mbpd)                  United States      58       66                         Europe      85       73      Africa      83       85      Total International      168       158      Worldwide Continuing Operations      226       224      Discontinued Operations(a)      -       -      Worldwide      226       224                         Natural Gas Sales (mmcfd)                     United States      351       425                         Europe(b)      109       159      Africa      353       433      Total International      462       592      Worldwide Continuing Operations      813       1,017      Discontinued Operations(a)      -       64      Worldwide      813       1,081                         Total Worldwide Sales (mboepd)                     Continuing Operations      361       393      Discontinued Operations(a)      -       11      Worldwide      361       404              Three Months Ended March 31,          2010       2009                     E&P Operating Statistics                 Average Realizations (c)                 Liquid Hydrocarbons (per bbl)                 United States    $ 72.46     $ 36.60                         Europe      78.95       47.59      Africa      70.96       36.70      Total International      75.01       41.71      Worldwide Continuing Operations      74.35       40.20      Discontinued Operations      -       -      Worldwide    $ 74.35     $ 40.20                         Natural Gas (per mcf)                     United States    $ 5.49     $ 4.49                         Europe      6.17       5.36      Africa      0.25       0.25      Total International      1.65       1.62      Worldwide Continuing Operations      3.31       2.82      Discontinued Operations      -       8.60      Worldwide    $ 3.31     $ 3.16           (a)   Our businesses in Ireland and Gabon were sold in 2009.

OSM segment revenues increased $43 million in the first quarter of 2010 from the comparable prior-year period. The increase was driven primarily by a 92 percent increase in average realizations. Net synthetic crude sales for the first quarter of 2010 were 25 mbpd at an average realized price of $73.76 per barrel compared to 32 mbpd at $38.49 in the same period of 2009. The decreased sales volumes reflect lower volumes sold as a result of previously discussed turnaround and the buildup of bitumen required for the AOSP Expansion 1.       25     Index   Revenues in both periods include the impact of derivative instruments intended to mitigate price risk related to future sales of synthetic crude. Included in segment revenues was a net loss of $10 million on crude oil derivative instruments in the first quarter of 2010 versus a net gain $8 million for the same period in 2009.   See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion about derivative instruments.     RM&T segment revenues increased $4,688 million in the first quarter of 2010 from the comparable prior-year period. While our overall refined product sales volumes in the first quarter of 2010 were relatively unchanged compared to the same period of 2009 our refined product and liquid hydrocarbon selling prices were higher as illustrated by the wholesale benchmark prices on the table below.             Three Months Ended March 31,      (Dollars per gallon)     2010       2009      Chicago Spot Unleaded regular gasoline    $ 2.02     $ 1.23     Chicago Spot Ultra-low sulfur diesel      2.04       1.30     USGC Spot Unleaded regular gasoline      2.05       1.22     USGC Spot Ultra-low sulfur diesel    $ 2.06     $ 1.33       Income from equity method investments increased $58 million in the first quarter of 2010 from the comparable prior-year period. Higher commodity prices in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 positively impacted the earnings of many of our equity method investees.     Net gain on disposal of assets was the sale of a 20 percent outside-operated undivided interest in our E&P segment’s the Production Sharing and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola. During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a gain of $811 million on the sale.     Cost of revenues increased $5,524 million in the first quarter of 2010 from the comparable prior-year period. The increase resulted primarily from higher acquisition costs of crude oil, refinery charge and blendstocks and purchased refined products in the RM&T segment. Increased volumes of purchased refined products also contributed to the increase. In addition, higher turnaround costs of $180 million in the RM&T and OSM segments contributed to increased cost of revenues compared to prior year.     Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) decreased $11 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same quarter of 2009. Decreased DD&A related to the lower sales volumes in our E&P and OSM segments were mostly offset by increased DD&A related to the Garyville expansion being put in to service.     Long-lived asset impairments in the first quarter of 2010 were primarily related to the Powder River Basin. In March 2010, our reservoir study concluded and a portion of our Powder River Basin field was removed from our plans for future development, resulting in $423 million impairment (see Note 11).     Exploration expenses were $98 million in the first quarter of 2010, including expenses related to dry wells of $32 million, primarily in Alaska and Equatorial Guinea. Exploration expenses were $62 million in the first quarter of 2009, including expenses related to dry wells of $4 million, primarily related to offshore drilling.     Provision for income taxes increased $256 million in the first quarter of 2010 from the comparable period of 2009 primarily due to the increase in pretax income. The effective income tax rate also increased as a result of tax legislation changes, see Note 8.     The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for the first three months of 2010 and 2009.

The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in “Corporate and other unallocated items”.     United States E&P income increased $161 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009. The increase is primarily related to a 98 percent increase in liquid hydrocarbon realizations. Partially offsetting the increase were lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from the Gulf of Mexico due to normal production declines and lower natural gas and natural gas liquid sales volumes realized due to the Permian Basin divestitures. DD&A expense decreased approximately $35 million, pretax, as a result of lower sales volumes.     International E&P income increased $258 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009. This increase in income is primarily related to an 80 percent increase in liquid hydrocarbon realizations and increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from Europe. Partially offsetting the impact of realizations was increased exploration expenses.     OSM segment reported a loss of $17 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $24 million in the first quarter 2009. The smaller segment loss in the first quarter of 2010 was primarily related to higher realizations, with a 92 percent improvement in realizations compared to the first quarter of 2009. This was offset by lower volumes produced as a result of the previously discussed turnaround and the buildup of bitumen required for the AOSP Expansion 1. We incurred pretax incremental costs of $30 million related to the turnaround that began in March 2010. In addition, revenues in both periods were impacted by derivatives with a net loss of $10 million in the first quarter of 2010 versus a net gain $8 million for the same period in 2009.     RM&T segment income decreased $396 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009. The income decrease was primarily a result of a lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, which was a negative 5.69 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2010 compared to a positive 7.92 cents per gallon in the comparable period of 2009. Several factors contributed to the lower first quarter 2010. We incurred incrementally higher crude oil costs due to lower sweet/sour differentials and increased domestic crude oil acquisition costs. In addition, manufacturing costs were higher due to a combination of increased planned turnaround costs and higher depreciation expense related to the Garyville expansion units now being in service. Turnaround costs included in the gross margin increased by a pretax $150 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009.     Our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin also included pretax derivative losses of $23 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to losses of $60 million in the first quarter of 2009.       27     Index     IG segment income increased $17 million in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009. Decreased spending on natural gas technology research was the primary reason for the increase in income. Despite a planned turnaround at the Equatorial Guinea gas production facilities, which significantly reduced natural gas volumes to the LNG and methanol facilities during the quarter, we were was able to take advantage of higher LNG and methanol prices through the sale of inventories in Equatorial Guinea.    Cash Flows and Liquidity   Cash Flows     Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $849 million in the first three months of 2010, compared to $839 million in the first three months of 2009.     Net cash used in investing activities totaled $10 million in the first three months of 2010, compared to $1,558 million in the first three months of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, we closed the sale of our 20 percent outside-operated undivided interest in the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola. The related cash inflow, $1.3 billion proceeds on this sale, approximated the amounts we spent on property, plant and equipment additions in the quarter.     In our E&P segment, exploration and development projects in 2010 are offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, on our Angola development and U.S. unconventional resource plays. The 2010 exploration and development budget of $1,023 million is 30 percent higher than 2009 spending. With the completion of our Garyville refinery expansion at the end of 2009, we have reduced spending in our RM&T segment while keeping the expansion and upgrading of our Detroit, Michigan, refinery on track. The AOSP Expansion 1 in our OSM segment continues into 2010, with the spending rate relatively unchanged from 2009 levels.   Net cash used in financing activities was $172 million in the first three months of 2010, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,307 million in the first three months of 2009. Dividends paid were a significant use of cash in all periods. Sources of cash in the first three months of 2009 included the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations and our $3.0 billion committed revolving credit facility. Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, share repurchase program, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.   Capital Resources   At March 31, 2010, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility.     On July 26, 2007, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.         28     Index      Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 21 percent at March 31, 2010, compared to 23 percent at December 31, 2009. This includes $337 million of debt that is serviced by United States Steel.

This represents a 4 percent increase in our quarterly dividend from 24 cents per share of common stock.     In April 2010, we repurchased $500 million in aggregate principal of our debt under two tender offers. Additional information on this debt repurchase can be found in Note 13.     Since January 2006, our Board of Directors has authorized a common share repurchase program totaling $5 billion. As of March 31, 2010, we had repurchased 66 million common shares at a cost of $2,922 million. We have not made any purchases under the program since August 2008. Purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. The program’s authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables. The timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales, cash from available borrowings and market conditions.     Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The forward-looking statements about our common stock repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production, refining and mining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.         29     Index     Contractual Cash Obligations     The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of March 31, 2010.                               2011-       2013-      Later      (In millions)     Total       2010        2012       2014      Years      Long-term debt (excludes interest)(a)    $ 8,191     $ 68     $ 1,671     $ 1,044     $ 5,408     Sale-leaseback financing(a)      33       11       22       -       -     Capital lease obligations(a)      660       23       81       88       468     Operating lease obligations(a)      847       102       247       183       315     Operating lease obligations under sublease(a)      15       3       12       -       -     Purchase obligations:                                            Crude oil, feedstock, refined product      8,655       6,981       1,054       459       161      and ethanol contracts                                            Transportation and related contracts      2,202       307       404       254       1,237     Contracts to acquire property, plant and      2,850       1,860       965       18       7      equipment                                            LNG terminal operating costs(b)      140       10       25       26       79     Service and materials contracts(c)      2,012       277       469       328       938     Unconditional purchase obligations(d)      47       8       16       16       7     Commitments for oil and gas exploration      36       28       1       1       6      (non-capital)(e)                                            Total purchase obligations      15,942       9,471       2,934       1,102       2,435     Other long-term liabilities reported                                             in the consolidated balance sheet(f)      2,300       81       643       560       1,016     Total contractual cash obligations(g)    $ 27,988     $ 9,759     $ 5,610     $ 2,977     $  9,642            (a)     Includes debt and lease obligations assumed by United States Steel upon the USX Separation.          (b)   We have acquired the right to deliver 58 bcf of natural gas per year to the Elba Island LNG re-gasification terminal. The agreement’s primary term ends in 2021. Pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the terminal.          (c)   Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance.

(e)   Commitments on oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs.          (f)   Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2019. Also includes amounts for uncertain tax positions.          (g)   This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties.         Receivable from United States Steel  We remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for $337 million of certain debt and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel Corporation (“United States Steel”) has assumed responsibility for repayment (see the USX Separation in Item 1. of our 2009 Annual Report on 10-K). United States Steel reported in its Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2010 that it believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. United States Steel’s senior unsecured debt ratings are BB by Standard and Poor’s Corporation, Ba2 by Moody’s Investment Service, Inc. and BB+ by Fitch Ratings. The ratings listed reflect a Moody’s upgrade from Ba3 to Ba2 in March 2010.    Critical Accounting Estimates     There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates subsequent to December 31, 2009.         30     Index     Environmental Matters     We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil, refined products and feedstocks.     We estimate that we may spend approximately $1 billion over a six -year period that began in 2008 to comply with Mobile Source Air Toxics II (“MSAT II”) regulations relating to benzene content in refined products. We have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these requirements. Our actual MSAT II expenditures since inception have totaled $343 million through March 31, 2010, with $60 million in the first quarter of 2010. We expect total year 2010 spending will be approximately $300 million. The cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as further work is completed in 2010.     There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2009.      Other Contingencies     We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to us. However, we believe that we will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to us.

Legal Proceedings     We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are included below. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. However, we believe that we will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.     MTBE Litigation     We are a defendant, along with other refining companies, in 27 cases arising in four states alleging damages for MTBE contamination. We finalized the settlement of 25 of those cases that were pending in the state and federal courts of New York and Florida. These cases have been dismissed by the respective courts. The settlement did not significantly impact our consolidated results of operations, financial positions, or cash flows. Two new MTBE cases were filed against us. The Village of Bethalto, Illinois filed suit in the state court of Madison County, IL and 6 municipalities and a county in Maryland filed suit in Baltimore County, MD. We expect additional MTBE lawsuits against us in the future, but likewise do not expect them to significantly impact our consolidated results of operations, financial positions, or cash flows.     Environmental Proceedings     During 2001, we entered into a New Source Review consent decree and settlement of alleged Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and other violations with the U.S. EPA covering all of our refineries. The settlement committed us to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to our refineries over approximately an eight-year period, which are now substantially complete. In addition, we have been working on certain agreed-upon supplemental environmental projects as part of this settlement of an enforcement action for alleged CAA violations and these have been completed. As part of this consent decree, we were required to conduct evaluations of refinery benzene waste air pollution programs (benzene waste “NESHAPS”). Subject to entering a formal consent decree or further amendment of the New Source Review consent decree to memorialize our understanding, we have agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. EPA to pay a civil penalty of $408,000 and conduct supplemental environmental projects of approximately $1 million, as part of a settlement of an enforcement action for alleged CAA violations relating to benzene waste NESHAPS. A modification to our New Source Review consent decree was lodged with the Court on March 19, 2010 and is expected to be finalized during second quarter 2010.      Item 1A. Risk Factors     We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following two updates to our risk factors are as follows:    Our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us.   Our offshore exploration and development operations represent increased technological challenges and operating risks, primarily associated with the marine environment. Because deepwater areas are typically farther from land than shallow water areas, operating in deepwater areas pose incrementally greater risks because these projects often lack proximity to the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from oil spills or releases of hazardous materials may result in substantial liabilities and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow and the market value of our securities.     We will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced.   As we discussed in our annual 10-K report, we believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. As an update to legislation and regulatory activity that impacts or could impact our operations:       36     Index         ·    EPA issued a finding in 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. Trade groups to which Marathon belongs, several states and others have filed legal challenges to this endangerment finding in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. A decision is not expected in this case for about two years. Related to the endangerment finding, in April of 2010, the EPA finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources (cars and light duty vehicles). The endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard will lead to widespread regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions starting in 2012 and the EPA is expected to issue a so-called tailoring rule in the second quarter of 2010 to limit the applicability of the EPA’s major permitting programs to larger sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as our refineries and a few large production facilities. Legal challenges are also expected to the emission standard for mobile sources and the tailoring rule.          ·    Congress may continue to consider legislation in 2010 on greenhouse gas emissions, which may include a cap and trade system for stationary sources and a carbon fee on transportation fuels.      Although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain refined products) associated with any legislation, regulation or other action, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented.
