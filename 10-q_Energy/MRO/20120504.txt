Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Key Operating and Financial Activities     In the first quarter of 2012, notable items were:       ·    Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes of 383 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboed”), of which 62 percent was liquid hydrocarbons          ·    Net international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, for which average realizations have exceeded West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil, were 62 percent of total liquid hydrocarbon sales          ·    Resumed liftings from Libya for average net sales of 17 mboed and production available for sale of 35 mboed          ·    Net synthetic crude oil sales of 44 thousand barrels per day (“mbbld”), a 19 percent increase over the same period of last year          ·    Average net sales volumes of 26 mboed from the Bakken shale, an 86 percent increase over the same quarter of last year          ·    Average net sales volumes of 14 mboed from the Eagle Ford shale, with 17 dedicated drilling rigs and 4 dedicated hydraulic fracturing crews working in the Eagle Ford shale          ·    Gulf of Mexico Ozona development impairment of $261 million due to a 2 million barrels of oil equivalent (“mmboe”) reduction in estimated proved reserves          ·    Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of 20 percent          ·    Disposed of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems for a pretax gain of $166 million      Some significant April 2012 activities include:       ·    Replaced existing revolving credit facility with a new $2.5 billion facility maturing April 2017          ·    Entered an agreement to dispose of all of our assets in Alaska          ·    Entered multiple agreements to expand holdings in the core of the Eagle Ford shale by approximately 20,000 net acres        Overview and Outlook     Exploration and Production     Production     Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales averaged 383 mboed during the first quarter of 2012 compared to 400 mboed in the same quarter of 2011. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased in the U.S., reflecting the impact of the Eagle Ford shale assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 and our ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and other U.S. unconventional resource plays. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from the U.K. were lower in the first quarter of 2012 than in the same period of 2011 due to unplanned repairs at Foinaven and the timing of liftings.          16          In the Eagle Ford shale, we had 17 operated rigs drilling and four hydraulic fracturing crews working as of March 31, 2012. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales were 14 mboed for the first quarter of 2012. To complement drilling and completions activity, we continue to build infrastructure to support production growth across the operating area. Approximately 90 miles of gathering lines were installed in the first quarter of 2012, in addition to two new central gathering and treating facilities, with six additional facilities currently under construction.      First quarter 2012 average net sales volumes from the Bakken shale were 26 mboed compared to 14 mboed in the same quarter of 2011. Our Bakken liquid hydrocarbon volumes average approximately 95 percent crude oil. We have eight drilling rigs and three hydraulic fracturing crews working in the play. Additionally, our drilling pace has exceeded expectations this year with improved “spud-to-spud” drilling times.     In the Anadarko Woodford shale, net sales volumes averaged 5 mboed during the first quarter of 2012 compared to 1 mboed in the same quarter of 2011. We have six drilling rigs working in the Anadarko Woodford play, where performance is being driven by continued strong results in the Cana core area, and additional operated activity on our Knox acreage position. We are planning to begin an 80-acre infill project in the Knox area in May 2012.     In the first quarter 2011, production operations in Libya were suspended. In the fourth quarter of 2011, limited production resumed and during the first quarter of 2012, sales volumes were 17 mboed. The return of our operations in Libya to pre-conflict levels is unknown at this time; however, we and our partners in the Waha concessions are assessing the condition of our assets.     Our E&P segment’s Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico began production in December 2011. During the first quarter of 2012, production rates declined significantly and have remained below initial expectations. Accordingly, our reserve engineers performed an evaluation of our future production as well as our reserves which concluded in early April 2012. This resulted in a 2 mmboe reduction in proved reserves and a $261 million impairment charge in the first quarter of 2012.     A 28-day turnaround began at our production operations in Equatorial Guinea on March 23, 2012. It was completed in April 2012 seven days ahead of schedule and below budget.     Exploration   During the first quarter of 2012, on the Birchwood oil sands lease located in Alberta, Canada, we conducted a seismic survey and drilled six water wells. We also submitted a regulatory application for a proposed 12 mbbld steam assisted gravity drainage (“SAGD”) project at Birchwood. Pending regulatory approval, construction is expected to begin in 2014, with first oil projected in 2016. We have a 100 percent working interest in Birchwood.     Acquisitions and Divestitures     On January 3, 2012, we closed on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems for proceeds of $206 million. This includes our equity method interests in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and Odyssey Pipeline L.L.C., as well as certain other oil pipeline interests, including the Eugene Island pipeline system. A pretax gain of $166 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2012.     In April 2012, we entered agreements to sell all our assets in Alaska. The transactions are expected to close in the second half of 2012, pending regulatory approval and closing conditions.     In April 2012, we entered multiple agreements to acquire approximately 20,000 net acres in the core of the Eagle Ford shale formation in transactions valued at $767 million, subject to closing adjustments. The majority of the transactions in terms of value are expected to close in the third quarter of 2012. In addition to undeveloped acreage, on the date of the agreements, these transactions included 13 gross wells producing 7 net mboed. Approximately 45 percent of the acreage is held by production.     The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the timing of the commencement of construction and first oil on the SAGD project, the sale of the Alaska assets, and acquisitions in the Eagle Ford shale. The timing of the commencement of construction and first oil on the SAGD project can be affected by delays in obtaining and conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, board approval, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and other risks associated with construction projects. The completion of the sale of substantially all of the Alaska assets is subject to necessary government and regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The sale of the Alaska drilling rig is subject to the buyer’s exercise of its purchase right under the purchase and sale agreement. The acquisitions in the Eagle Ford shale are subject to customary closing conditions. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.     Oil Sands Mining   Our OSM operations consist of a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”). Our net synthetic crude oil sales were 44 mbbld in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 37 mbbld in the same quarter of 2011. This sales increase is primarily due to less downtime for planned and unplanned maintenance in the 2012 period.   With production capacity at the AOSP now at 255,000 gross barrels per day, the focus will be on improving operating efficiencies and adding capacity through debottlenecking.            17          Integrated Gas   LNG and methanol sales from Equatorial Guinea are conducted through equity method investees that purchase dry gas from our E&P assets in Equatorial Guinea. Our share of LNG sales totaled 6,291 metric tonnes per day (“mtd”) for the first quarter of 2012 compared to 7,822 mtd in the first quarter of 2011. LNG sales volumes are down because the first quarter of 2011 also included LNG sales from Alaska which were conducted through a consolidated subsidiary. LNG sales from Alaska ceased when our interest was sold in the third quarter of 2011. Also, a 30-day turnaround began at the LNG facility in Equatorial Guinea on March 23, 2012. Full production resumed ahead of schedule on April 17, 2012.     Market Conditions     Exploration and Production   Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists the benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages in the first quarter in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011.           Three Months Ended March 31,          2012       2011      West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil (Dollars per bbl)    $ 103.03     $ 94.60     Brent (Europe) crude oil (Dollars per bbl)    $ 118.49     $ 104.96     Henry Hub natural gas (Dollars per million British thermal units ("mmbtu"))(a)    $ 2.74     $ 4.11         (a)   Settlement date average.        In the first quarter of 2012, average crude oil benchmark prices increased compared to the same quarter of 2011. The average differential of Brent to WTI was a premium of approximately $15 per barrel in the first quarter of 2012. Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and a majority is sold in relation to the Brent crude oil benchmark.     Our domestic crude oil production was about 47 percent sour in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 70 percent in the first quarter of 2011. Reduced production from the Gulf of Mexico and increased onshore production from the Bakken and Eagle Ford shales contributed to the lower sour crude percentage. Sour crude oil contains more sulfur than light sweet WTI. Sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of its higher refining costs and lower refined product values.     A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Average Henry Hub settlement prices for natural gas were lower for the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter of the prior year. A decline in average settlement date Henry Hub natural gas prices began in September 2011 and has continued beyond the first quarter of 2012 with April averaging $2.19 per mmbtu. Should U.S. natural gas prices remain depressed, impairment charges related to our natural gas assets may be necessary.     Our other major natural gas-producing regions are Europe and Equatorial Guinea. Natural gas prices in Europe have been higher than the U.S. in recent periods. In the case of Equatorial Guinea, our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. The natural gas sales from Equatorial Guinea are at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average natural gas realized prices may not fully track market price movements.     Oil Sands Mining   OSM segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce. Roughly two-thirds of our normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil market, primarily Western Canadian Select. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader.     The operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per unit costs are sensitive to production rate. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) natural gas sales index and crude prices, respectively. Recently AECO prices have declined, much as Henry Hub prices have. We would expect a significant, continued decline in natural gas prices to have a favorable impact on OSM operating costs.        18          The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the first quarter of 2012 compared to first quarter of 2011.

(b)    Monthly average AECO day ahead index.      Integrated Gas     Our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in Equatorial Guinea   We have a 60 percent ownership in an LNG production facility in Equatorial Guinea, which sells LNG under a long-term contract at prices tied to Henry Hub natural gas prices.   We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Equatorial Guinea through our investment in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”). Methanol demand has a direct impact on AMPCO’s earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. AMPCO’s plant capacity of 1.1 million tones is about 2 percent of 2011 estimated world demand.     Results of Operations   Consolidated Results of Operations     Due to the spin-off of our downstream business on June 30, 2011, which is reported as discontinued operations, income from continuing operations is more representative of Marathon Oil as an independent energy company. Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes in the first quarter of 2012 was 36 percent higher than in the same quarter of 2011 primarily due to increased liquid hydrocarbon prices. As a result of increased income from continuing operations before tax in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily Norway, the effective tax rate was 69 percent in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 54 percent in the first quarter of 2011.      Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table:           Three Months Ended March 31,      (In millions)     2012       2011      E&P    $ 3,412     $ 3,327     OSM      379       306     IG      -       64      Segment revenues      3,791       3,697     Elimination of intersegment revenues      -       (26 )    Total revenues    $ 3,791     $ 3,671         E&P segment revenues increased $85 million in the first quarter of 2012 from the comparable prior-year period. Included in our E&P segment are supply optimization activities which include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. Supply optimization serves to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. See the Cost of revenues discussion as revenues from supply optimization approximate the related costs. Higher average crude oil prices in the first quarter of 2012 increased revenues related to supply optimization.     Revenues from the sale of our U.S. production are higher in the first quarter of 2012 primarily as a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and price realizations, partially offset by decreased natural gas sales volumes and price realizations. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our U.S. operations.            19                  Three Months Ended March 31,          2012       2011      United States Operating Statistics                 Net liquid hydrocarbons sales (mbbld) (a)      90       78      Liquid hydrocarbon average realizations (per bbl) (b)    $ 93.63     $ 86.42                         Net natural gas sales (mmcfd)      344       368      Natural gas average realizations (per mcf) (b)    $ 4.13     $ 5.15         (a)    Includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.        (b)    Excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments.      Liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting our ongoing development programs primarily in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays, partially offset by decreased production in the Gulf of Mexico.   The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our international operations.           Three Months Ended March 31,          2012       2011      International Operating Statistics                 Net liquid hydrocarbon sales (mbbld)(a)                 Europe      97       111      Africa      52       58      Total International      149       169      Liquid hydrocarbon average realizations (per bbl) (b)                     Europe    $ 123.76     $ 109.85      Africa      94.41       81.47      Total International    $ 113.55     $ 100.10                         Net natural gas sales (mmcfd)                     Europe(c)      104       102      Africa      418       446      Total International      522       548      Natural gas average realizations (per mcf) (b)                     Europe    $ 9.99     $ 10.29      Africa      0.24       0.25      Total International    $ 2.19     $ 2.12         (a)    Includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. The amounts correspond with the basis for fiscal settlements with governments, representing equity tanker liftings and direct deliveries of liquid hydrocarbons.        (b)    Excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments.        (c)    Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 14 mmcfd and 15 mmcfd in the first quarters of 2012 and 2011.        Compared to the first quarter of 2011, international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes were lower for the first quarter of 2012 primarily in the U.K. This was due to unplanned downtime at Foinaven and the timing of liftings.   OSM segment revenues increased $73 million in the first quarter of 2012 from the comparable prior-year period. The increase was driven primarily by a 7 percent increase in average realizations and an 18 percent increase in sales volumes as shown in the table below.           Three Months Ended March 31,          2012       2011      OSM Operating Statistics                 Net synthetic crude oil sales (mbbld)(a)      44       37      Synthetic crude oil average realizations (per bbl)    $ 90.88     $ 84.98         (a)     Includes blendstocks.        The increased sales volumes are a result of the upgrader expansion which was completed in the second quarter of 2011 and longer periods of downtime for planned and unplanned maintenance in the first quarter of 2011.   IG segment revenues decreased $64 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011. Sales of LNG from our Alaska operations ceased completely in the third quarter of 2011 because we sold our equity interest in the facility.       20          Income from equity method investments decreased $39 million in the first quarter of 2012 from the comparable prior-year period. The decline is a result of lower natural gas prices and lower volumes as a result of a scheduled turnaround at our LNG facility in Equatorial Guinea.     Net gain on disposal of assets in the first quarter of 2012 was primarily the $166 million gain on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems.     Cost of revenues increased $3 million in the first quarter of 2012 from the comparable prior-year period, primarily due to our supply optimization activities. Costs related to supply optimization were $775 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $738 million in the first quarter of 2011. Excluding costs related to supply optimization, the overall decrease in costs is primarily the result of lower liquid hydrocarbon sales in the U.K. due to the timing of liftings.     Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) decreased $61 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter of 2011. Because both our E&P and OSM segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, the previously discussed increases or decreases in sales volumes generally result in similar changes in DD&A. Decreased DD&A in the first quarter reflects the impact of lower E&P segment sales volumes, partially offset by increases in the OSM segment. The DD&A rate (expense per barrel of oil equivalent), which is impacted by changes in reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes in our DD&A. Lower DD&A rates per barrel in our E&P operations contributed to the overall lower DD&A. The following table provides DD&A rates for our E&P and OSM segments.           Three Months Ended March 31,      ($ per boe)     2012       2011      DD&A rate                     E&P Segment                     United States    $ 24     $ 28      International    $ 9     $ 10     OSM Segment    $ 18     $ 16       Impairments in the first quarter of 2012 relate to the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements).     General and administrative expenses decreased during the first quarter of 2012 from the comparable prior year period primarily due to decreased incentive compensation expense.      Exploration expenses were lower in the first quarter of 2012 than in the same period of 2011, primarily due to higher dry well costs in the prior period. Dry well costs in the first quarter of 2011 primarily related to the Flying Dutchman in the Gulf of Mexico and the Romeo prospect in Indonesia.     The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses.             Three Months Ended March 31,      (In millions)     2012       2011      Dry well and unproved property impairment    $ 58     $ 172     Geological, geophysical, seismic      43       15     Other      41       43      Total exploration expenses    $ 142     $ 230       Provision for income taxes increased $391 million in the first quarter of 2012 from the comparable period of 2011 primarily due to the increase in pretax income and the resumption of sales in Libya in the first quarter of 2012.     The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in “Corporate and other unallocated items” shown in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.            21          Our effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2012 is 69 percent. This rate is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings from foreign jurisdictions, primarily Norway and Libya, where the tax rate is in excess of the U.S. statutory rate. An increase in earnings and associated taxes from foreign jurisdictions, primarily Norway, as compared to prior periods caused an increase in our valuation allowance on current year foreign tax credits. In Libya, where the statutory tax rate is in excess of 90 percent, limited production resumed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and liquid hydrocarbon sales resumed in the first quarter of 2012. A reliable estimate of 2012 annual ordinary income from our Libyan operations cannot be made and the range of possible scenarios when including ordinary income from our Libyan operations in the worldwide annual effective tax rate calculation demonstrates significant variability. As such, for the three months ended March 31, 2012, an estimated annual effective tax rate was calculated excluding Libya and applied to consolidated ordinary income excluding Libya and the tax provision applicable to Libyan ordinary income was recorded as a discrete item in the period. Excluding Libya, the effective tax rate would be 64 percent for the first quarter of 2012.     Our effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2011 was 54 percent which is higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings from foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate is in excess of the U.S. statutory rate and the valuation allowance recorded against 2011 foreign tax credits.     Segment Results     Segment income is summarized in the following table.           Three Months Ended March 31,      (In millions)     2012       2011      E&P                 United States    $ 109     $ 30      International      368       638      E&P segment      477       668     OSM      41       32     IG      4       60      Segment income      522       760     Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes:                     Corporate and other unallocated items      (29 )     (115 )    Foreign currency remeasurement of taxes      (15 )     (14 )    Loss on early extinguishment of debt      -       (176 )    Impairment      (167 )     -      Gain on dispositions      106       -      Income from continuing operations      417       455      Discontinued operations      -       541     Net income    $ 417     $ 996       United States E&P income increased $79 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011. Increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and price realizations and, lower dry well costs and DD&A in the Gulf of Mexico, were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with increased activities in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays in the first quarter of 2012.     International E&P income decreased $270 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011. As previously discussed, increased income before tax in higher tax jurisdictions resulted in a higher effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011. Increased liquid hydrocarbon price realizations were mostly offset by the declines in sales volumes previously discussed. DD&A was lower in the first quarter of 2012 as a result of lower sales volumes, as well as lower exploration costs in Indonesia.     OSM segment income increased $9 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011 primarily as a result of the higher realizations and increased sales volumes.     IG segment income decreased $56 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011, primarily as a result of weaker natural gas prices in 2012 and lower LNG sales volumes due to the sale of the Alaska LNG facility in the third quarter of 2011.            22          Cash Flows and Liquidity     Cash Flows     Net cash provided by continuing operations was $973 million in the first three months of 2012, compared to $1,633 million in the first three months of 2011 reflecting primarily the lower E&P segment sales volumes, lower natural gas realizations and a negative change in working capital.     Net cash used in investing activities totaled $806 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to $711 million related to continuing operations in the first quarter of 2011. Significant investing activities are additions to property, plant and equipment and disposal of assets. In the first quarter of 2012, most additions to property, plant and equipment were related to our increased spending in U.S. unconventional resource plays, particularly the Eagle Ford shale and the resumption of drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. This compares to the first quarter of 2011, when spending on U.S. unconventional resource plays and drilling in Norway, Indonesia and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region accounted for most of the property, plant and equipment additions. In the first quarter of 2012, proceeds from the sale of assets were $208 million, primarily related to the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems.       Net cash used in financing activities was $157 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared to net cash used of $2,937 million related to continuing operations in the first quarter of 2011. During the first quarter of 2012, we repaid $53 million of debt upon its maturity. During the first quarter of 2011, we retired $2.5 billion principal amount of our debt before it was due. Dividends paid were a significant use of cash in both periods.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, the issuance of notes, our committed revolving credit facility and sales of non-core assets. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements. We issued and repaid $100 million of commercial paper in the first quarter of 2012.  Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, share repurchase program, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.     Capital Resources   At March 31, 2012, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility.    In April 2012, we terminated our $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new $2.5 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility matures in April 2017 but allows us to request two, one-year extensions. It contains an option to increase the commitment amount by up to an additional $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of any increasing lenders, and includes sub-facilities for swing-line loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $100 million and $500 million, respectively. Fees on the unused commitment of each lender range from 10 basis points to 25 basis points per year depending on our credit ratings. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (a) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 87.5 basis points to 162.5 basis points per year depending on our credit ratings or (b) the Base Rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0 basis points to 62.5 basis points depending on our credit ratings. Base Rate is defined as a per annum rate equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus one-half of one percent and (c) LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1 percent.   The agreement contains a covenant that requires our ratio of total debt to total capitalization not exceed 65 percent as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. If an event of default occurs, the lenders may terminate the commitments under the Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility.     We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.            23          Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 20 percent at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of the transactions, in terms of value, related to the Eagle Ford shale are expected to close in the third quarter of 2012, at which time the purchase price of approximately $767 million, before closing adjustments, will be paid.     We have increased our capital, investment and exploration budget, excluding acquisition costs, from $4.8 billion to $5.0 billion, of which $4.6 billion will be used for capital expenditures. The increase is a result of the additional acreage being acquired in the Eagle Ford shale and other adjustments.     Our opinions concerning liquidity, our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements, and the capital, investment and exploration budget are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The statements about our capital, investment and exploration budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil and natural gas, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.     The above discussion also contains forward-looking statements with respect to acquisitions in the Eagle Ford shale. These acquisitions are subject to customary closing conditions. The failure to satisfy these closing conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.     Contractual Cash Obligations   As of March 31, 2012, our consolidated contractual cash obligations have increased by $128 million from December 31, 2011, primarily related to contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment.     Critical Accounting Estimates     There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates subsequent to December 31, 2011.       24          Environmental Matters     We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes.     There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2011.       Other Contingencies     We are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    Litigation – In March 2011, Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (“Noble”) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Harris County, Texas alleging, among other things, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent misrepresentation, relating to a multi-year drilling contract for a newly constructed drilling rig to be deployed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We filed an answer in April 2011, contending, among other things, failure to perform, failure to comply with material obligations, failure to mitigate alleged damages and that Noble failed to provide the rig according to the operating, performance and safety requirements specified in the drilling contract. Noble is seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are vigorously defending this litigation. The ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, including any financial effect on us, remains uncertain. We do not believe an estimate of a reasonably probable loss (or range of loss) can be made for this lawsuit at this time.              25          Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Disclosures about how derivatives are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how the fair values of our derivative instruments are measured may be found in Note 13 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.     Sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2012 is provided in the following table.                         Incremental Change in Fair Value    (In millions)    Fair Value        Financial assets (liabilities): (a)                                   Interest rate swap agreements       $   4 (b)           $   4          Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year       $   (5,431)(b)           $   (226)            (a)     Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.        (b)    Fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.      The aggregate cash flow effect on foreign currency derivative contracts of a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates at March 31, 2012 would be $63 million.     These quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include forward-looking statements with respect to management’s opinion about risks associated with the use of derivative instruments. These statements are based on certain assumptions with respect to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and industry supply of and demand for natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, future outcomes with respect to our use of derivative instruments may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures     An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarter ended March 31, 2012, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.            26                MARATHON OIL CORPORATION            Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited)                  Three Months Ended March 31,      (In millions)     2012       2011                     Segment Income (Loss)                 Exploration and Production                 United States    $ 109     $ 30      International      368       638      E&P segment      477       668      Oil Sands Mining      41       32      Integrated Gas      4       60      Segment income      522       760      Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes      (105 )     (305 )    Income from continuing operations      417       455      Discontinued Operations(a)      -       541      Net income    $ 417     $ 996     Capital Expenditures(b)                     Exploration and Production                     United States    $ 862     $ 349      International      139       319      E&P segment      1,001       668      Oil Sands Mining      52       120      Integrated Gas      -       1      Corporate      42       6      Total    $ 1,095     $ 795     Exploration Expenses                     United States    $ 93     $ 151      International      49       79      Total    $ 142     $ 230         (a)    The spin-off of our downstream business was completed on June 30, 2011, and has been reported as discontinued operations in 2011.

Legal Proceedings     We are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There have been no significant changes in legal or environmental proceedings during the first quarter of 2012.   Item 1A. Risk Factors     We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A.
