Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q and our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Spin-off Downstream Business into Independent Company     On June 30, 2011, the spin-off of Marathon’s downstream (Refining, Marketing and Transportation) business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”) and Marathon Oil Corporation. Marathon shareholders at the close of business on the record date of June 27, 2011 received one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon common stock held. Fractional shares of MPC common stock were not distributed and any fractional share of MPC common stock otherwise issuable to a Marathon shareholder was sold in the open market on such shareholder's behalf, and such shareholder received a cash payment with respect to that fractional share. A tax ruling received in June 2011 from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. Activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Form 10-Q (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information).   Overview      We are an international energy company with operations in the U.S., Canada, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. Our operations are organized into three reportable segments:       w   Exploration and Production (“E&P”) which explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis.    w   Oil Sands Mining (“OSM”) which mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil.    w   Integrated Gas (“IG”) which markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and methanol, on a worldwide basis.      Assets within these three segments are at various stages in their lifecycle and we further classify them as base, growth or exploration. We have a stable group of base assets, which include our OSM and IG segments and traditional E&P assets in Norway, Equatorial Guinea, the U.K. and the U.S. These assets generate much of the cash that will be available for investment in our growth assets and exploration projects. Growth assets are where we expect to make significant investment in order to realize production and reserve increases. We are focused on North America liquid hydrocarbon growth by developing liquids-rich shale play positions, including the establishment of a dominant position in the core of the Eagle Ford shale play. In addition to the North America shale plays, growth assets include the development of Angola Block 31 and our Canadian in-situ assets. Our areas of exploration are Poland, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region and the Gulf of Mexico.       Operating and Financial Highlights   Significant operating and financial highlights during the third quarter of 2011 include:       ·    Liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales of 349 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”), of which 60 percent was liquid hydrocarbons          ·    International liquid hydrocarbon sales, which receive higher prices than West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil, were 67 percent of total          ·    Synthetic crude oil sales of 50 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”), a 61 percent increase over the same period last year          ·    Operating seven rigs and two hydraulic fracturing crews in North Dakota’s Bakken shale play          ·    Operating six rigs in the Anadarko Woodford shale play             23              ·    Completed the Shi Randall (50 percent working interest) well in the Anadarko Woodford shale which had an initial 30-day production rate of 1,693 mboepd, of which 35 percent was liquids          ·    Added a second drilling rig in the Niobrara shale play          ·    Received exploration permits for the Innsbruck (Mississippi Canyon block 993, 85 percent working interest) and Key Largo (Walker Ridge block 578, 60 percent working interest) prospects and lease extensions on 26 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico          ·    Completed the Ozona well (Garden Banks block 515, 68 percent working interest) as a single zone producer and is ready for first production          ·    Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of 2 percent, however, this will increase in the fourth quarter of 2011 upon completion of the Eagle Ford shale and gathering system acquisitions          ·    Repurchased approximately 12 million common shares at a cost of $300 million      Acquisitions and Dispositions   Early in the fourth quarter, we closed on the following transactions in Eagle Ford: the previously announced 141,000 net acres from Hilcorp Resources Holdings, LP (“Hilcorp”); additional interests of approximately 19,000 acres net acres; and a gas gathering system. Also, during the fourth quarter, we expect to close on an additional 6,800 net acres in Eagle Ford from tag-along rights. The total acquisition cost for these nearly 167,000 net acres and the gathering system is expected to be approximately $4.5 billion, including projected closing adjustments and future carrying costs. These transactions will be funded largely from existing cash. The acreage includes proved and unproved oil and gas assets, as well as some producing wells. We are in the process of evaluating the acquisitions to determine whether they will be accounted for as business combinations or as asset acquisitions.   In October 2011, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our E&P segment’s equity interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems including our 28 percent interest in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, L.L.C., our 29 percent interest in Odyssey Pipeline L.L.C., our 23 percent interest in the Eugene Island Pipeline System, and certain other oil pipeline interests. The value of this transaction, subject to further closing adjustments, is approximately $206 million, net of debt. In addition, the Poseidon and Odyssey interests are subject to wavier of rights of first refusal. The carrying value of these assets was $45 million as of September 30, 2011. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2011.   Completed   During the third quarter of 2011, we sold our Integrated Gas segment’s equity interest in a liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) processing facility in Alaska. A gain on the transaction of $8 million was recorded in the third quarter.   In April 2011, we assigned a 30 percent undivided working interest in our Exploration and Production (“E&P”) segment’s approximately 180,000 acres in the Niobrara shale play located within the DJ Basin of southeast Wyoming and northern Colorado for total consideration of $270 million, recording a pretax gain of $37 million. We remain operator of this jointly owned leasehold.   Also in April 2011, we farmed-out a 40 percent working interest in 10 concessions in our E&P segment’s Poland’s Paleozoic Shale play. In late July 2011, we sold an additional 9 percent working interest. A $12 million pretax gain was recorded. We currently hold a 51 percent working interest in these 10 concessions and serve as operator.   In March 2011, we closed the sale of our E&P segment's outside-operated interests in the Gudrun field development and the Brynhild and Eirin exploration areas offshore Norway for net proceeds of $85 million, excluding working capital adjustments. A $64 million pretax loss on this disposition was recorded in the fourth quarter 2010.   During the first quarter 2010, we closed the sale of a 20 percent outside-operated interest in our E&P segment’s Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola. We received net proceeds of $1.3 billion and recorded a pretax gain on the sale in the amount of $811 million. We retained a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32.   Exploration Projects   We have notified our joint venture partner and the Indonesian government that we intend to relinquish the Pasangkayu Production Sharing Contract (PSC). Discussions continue and we are awaiting a government response. We also plan to shift from an operating to a non-operating position in both the Bone Bay and Kumawa PSCs over the coming year.   During the first quarter of 2011, on the Birchwood oil sands lease located in Alberta, Canada, we drilled 94 stratigraphic test wells. The drilling results are currently being evaluated. Initial results are positive, with the wells encountering expected or greater-than-expected reservoir potential.        24          In April 2011, we announced a discovery on the Atrush block in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. The Atrush-1 well was drilled to a total depth of approximately 11,000 feet and encountered pay in the Jurassic zones. Test flow rates were more than 6,000 gross barrels per day. We hold a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the Atrush block. A second discovery in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region was the Swara Tika-1 well on the Sarsang block. It was drilled to a total depth of approximately 12,500 feet and encountered 1,500 feet of gross oil column in the Triassic Kura Chine zones. Test flow rates totaled more than 7,000 bpd with associated gas. Test flow rates were limited by tubing sizes and testing equipment. We hold a 25 percent non-operated working interest in the Sarsang block. The Kurdistan Regional Government holds a 4 percent carried interest in both the Atrush and Sarsang blocks.     Libya   Civil unrest, which began in February 2011 in parts of North Africa, escalated to armed conflict in Libya where we have exploration and production operations. During the first quarter 2011, all production operations in Libya were suspended and we are not currently making deliveries of hydrocarbons from our interest in the Waha concession in eastern Libya. The return of our operations in Libya to pre-conflict levels is unknown at this time, however, we and our partners in the Waha concession are assessing the condition of our assets and when the resumption of operations will be viable.     As of September 30, 2011, our net property, plant and equipment investment in Libya is approximately $758 million and our net proved reserves in Libya were 242 million barrels of oil equivalent (“mmboe”) at December 31, 2010. Sales from Libya in 2010 averaged 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and we are in an underlift position of 847 thousand net barrels of liquid hydrocarbons.     In addition, payments due to the Libyan government or entities affiliated with the Libyan government have been blocked by the U.S. government under a February 25, 2011 executive order. As of September 30, 2011, such amounts, primarily related to taxes and royalties due on our January and February 2011 sales, totaled approximately $200 million.     Forward-looking Statements   The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the pending acquisitions in the Eagle Ford shale formation, the status of operations in Libya, the timing and levels of future production (including initial production rates), anticipated future exploratory drilling activity and the intended shift from operating to a non-operating position in Indonesia. Some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorists acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The completion of the acquisitions in the Eagle Ford shale formation is subject to customary closing conditions. The anticipated shift from operating to a non-operating position in both the Bone Bay and Kumawa PSCs in Indonesia is subject to obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.   Outlook   Highlights of our expected future activities include:       ·    Reaching ten operated drilling rigs in the Eagle Ford shale by year end, plus adding add a third crew dedicated to hydraulic fracturing in January and a fourth crew in June 2012. By this time next year we expect to have 17 rigs operating in the Eagle Ford shale.          ·    Completing the 27 gross operated wells awaiting completion in the Bakken shale in North Dakota, bringing 33 total wells on production before the end of 2011.          ·    Acquiring seismic data and drilling seven to nine gross wells in the Niobrara shale DJ Basin by yearend.          ·    Starting to drill our first well in Poland the fourth quarter of 2011. By the end of 2012, we plan to drill six to seven wells.          ·    Beginning to drill in the fourth quarter of 2011 on our two operated blocks (Harir and Safen) in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region.          ·    Executing a seismic program on our Birchwood oil sand lease in Alberta, Canada during the winter of 2011-2012 to continue our evaluation of the reservoir for insitu production.          ·    Reviewing our global asset portfolio with a goal of divesting between $1.5 and $3 billion of non-core assets over the next two to three years, including a potential farm down of a minority interest in our Gulf of Mexico prospects.          ·    Progressing toward a 2012 final investment decision on the Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (“”Quest CCS”) project which, as announced in the second quarter of 2011, the governments of Alberta and Canada have agreed to partially fund for 865 million Canadian dollars. The financing would be done over a period            25             of 15 years, including development, construction and 10 years of operations. However, the funding is subject to conditions of achieving certain performance objectives.       ·    Shutdown of the Muskeg River mine in Alberta, Canada for 10 days in October 2011.          ·    Projecting fourth quarter 2011 E&P segment production of between 360,000 and 370,000 boepd.      The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to future exploratory and development drilling activity, number of anticipated drilling rig activity, potential assets sales, the goal of divesting $1.5 to $3 billion on non-core assets and the Quest CCS project. Some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response and other geological, operating and economic considerations. Some factors that could potentially affect the sale of $1.5 billion to $3 billion in non-core assets include changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and synthetic crude oil, actions of competitors, future financial condition and operating results, and economic, business, competitive and /or regulatory factors affecting our businesses. The Quest CCS project could also be affected by projected costs and availability of materials and labor, and delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.     Market Conditions   Exploration and Production   Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists the benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, when compared to the same periods in 2010.             Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      Benchmark       2011       2010       2011       2010      West Texas Intermediate ("WTI")                             crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 89.54     $ 76.21     $ 95.47     $ 77.69     Brent (Europe) crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 113.46     $ 76.86     $ 111.93     $ 77.13     Henry Hub natural gas   (Dollars per mmbtu)(a)    $ 4.19     $ 4.38     $ 4.16     $ 4.59           (a)    Settlement date average.      Crude oil prices were higher in 2011 than in 2010 for all periods. Monthly average prices for Dated Brent have been over $100 per barrel since early February 2011. April 2011 WTI averaged $110.04 per barrel, but prices have been declining to an average of $85.61 in the month of September 2011.   Our domestic crude oil production was about 59 percent sour in the third quarter and 62 percent in the first nine months of 2011. Sour crude oil contains more sulfur than light sweet WTI. Sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of its higher refining costs and lower refined product values. Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and a majority is sold in relation to the Dated Brent crude oil benchmark.   Average natural gas prices have been less volatile in the periods presented. A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Our other major natural gas-producing regions are Europe and Equatorial Guinea, where our natural gas sales have been and, in the case of Equatorial Guinea primarily, still are subject to term contracts, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. The natural gas being sold from these regions, primarily Equatorial Guinea, is at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average natural gas realized prices may not fully track market price movements.   Oil Sands Mining   OSM segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce. Roughly two-thirds of our normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil market, primarily Western Canadian Select. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader.   The operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per unit costs are sensitive to production rate. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively.       26          The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 and 2010:             Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      Benchmark       2011       2010       2011       2010      WTI crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 89.54     $ 76.21     $ 95.47     $ 77.69     Western Canadian Select   (Dollars per barrel)(a)    $ 72.14     $ 60.55     $ 76.10     $ 64.72     AECO natural gas sales                                      index   (Dollars per mmbtu)(b)    $ 3.70     $ 3.44     $ 3.86     $ 3.99         (a)    Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada.        (b)    Monthly average of Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) day ahead index.      Integrated Gas   Our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, primarily in Europe and West Africa.   We have a 60 percent ownership in a production facility in Equatorial Guinea, which sells LNG under a long-term contract at prices tied to Henry Hub natural gas prices. In general, LNG delivered to the U.S. is tied to Henry Hub prices and will track with changes in U.S. natural gas prices, while LNG sold in Europe and Asia is indexed to crude oil prices and will track the movement of those prices.   We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Equatorial Guinea through our investment in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”). Methanol demand has a direct impact on AMPCO’s earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. AMPCO’s plant capacity of 1.1 million tonnes is about 3 percent of total world demand.     Results of Operations   Consolidated Results of Operation   Due to the spin-off of our downstream business on June 30, 2011, which is reported as discontinued operations, income from continuing operations is more representative of Marathon Oil as an independent energy company. Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2011 was 26 percent higher in the third quarter than in the same period of 2010, largely due to higher liquid hydrocarbon prices. This improvement was offset by a 69 percent continuing operations effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 55 percent in the same period last year. In the third quarter of 2011, Marathon incurred a non-cash charge of $227 million for foreign tax credits which we now expect to be unutilized in current or future periods. A higher production outlook for Norway due to better than expected performance contributed to our generating excess foreign tax credits.    In the first nine months of 2011, consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes was relatively consistent with the same period of 2010. Higher liquid hydrocarbon prices were offset by lower sales volumes in the E&P segment. For the first nine months of 2011, the continuing operations effective tax rate was 64 percent compared to 55 percent in the same period last year.   Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table:           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      (In millions)     2011       2010       2011       2010      E&P    $ 3,212     $ 2,640     $ 9,788     $ 7,712     OSM      427       196       1,180       567     IG      16       38       93       98                                         Segment revenues      3,655       2,874       11,061       8,377     Elimination of intersegment revenues      (6 )     (20 )     (47 )     (49 )    Total revenues    $ 3,649     $ 2,854     $ 11,014     $ 8,328       E&P segment revenues increased $572 million in the third quarter and $2,076 million in the first nine months of 2011 from the comparable prior-year periods. Revenues in both 2010 periods include the impact of derivative instruments intended to mitigate price risk on future sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. Net pretax derivative gains of $13 million and $91 million were reported in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010.   Included in our E&P segment are supply optimization activities which include sales of crude oil and natural gas purchased from partners and nearby producers for sale to satisfy transportation commitments and achieving flexibility in product type and delivery point. Revenues from these supply optimization activities are higher in the third quarter          27         and first nine months of 2011 than in comparable periods in part due higher crude oil prices in 2011.   Revenues from the sale of our production are higher in both periods primarily as a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon price realizations, but sales volumes have been more variable among the periods. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our United States operations.           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,          2011       2010       2011       2010      United States Operating Statistics                             Net liquid hydrocarbons sales (mbpd)      69       80       73       65      Liquid hydrocarbon average realization (per bbl)    $ 88.89     $ 69.52     $ 91.53     $ 69.95                                         Net natural gas sales (mmcfd)      296       363       326       350      Natural gas average realization (per mcf)    $ 4.85     $ 4.43     $ 5.04     $ 4.78       The Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico, which commenced production in July 2010, is the primary reason for the higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in the nine-month period of 2011, however, its production rates declined rapidly and is also a reason for lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes in the third quarter of 2011. In addition to the impact of Droshky on natural gas volumes, sales were lower in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 as compared to the same periods of 2010 because the Powder River Basin field which was sold in the second quarter of 2010 primarily produced natural gas, and mature fields continue a natural decline, while gas demand in Alaska decreased in the third quarter of 2011.   The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our international operations.

Compared to 2010, international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 are lower due to the temporary cessation of production from Libya in February 2011. Partially offsetting the impact of Libya in both periods, were higher liquid hydrocarbon sales from Europe primarily due to the timing of liftings and from Equatorial Guinea where a turnaround occurred in the first four months of 2010. Natural gas sales volumes from Equatorial Guinea were likewise higher in the 2011 periods due to this turnaround, while natural gas sales volumes from Europe were down primarily related to planned turnarounds and normal production declines in the U.K.    OSM segment revenues increased $231 million in the third quarter and $613 million in the first nine months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. The impact of derivative instruments intended to mitigate price risk relative to future sales of synthetic crude were losses of $8 million and gains of $34 million the third quarter and first nine months of 2010. All derivative positions closed in December 2010. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative instruments.           28          Excluding the derivative effects, segment revenues increased in both periods of 2011 due to higher synthetic crude oil realizations and volumes as shown on the table below.            Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,          2011       2010       2011       2010      OSM Operating Statistics                             Net synthetic crude sales (mbpd)       50       31       43       25      Synthetic crude average realization (per bbl)     $ 87.29     $ 67.83     $ 90.91     $ 69.07        The 2011 sales volumes improved as a result of the Jackpine mine, which commenced operations in late 2010, and the upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. Sales volumes in 2010 were impacted by a turnaround that commenced on March 22, 2010 that caused production to be completely shut down in April, with a staged resumption in May 2010.     IG segment revenues decreased $22 million in the third quarter and $5 million in the first nine months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. Sales of LNG from our Alaska operations declined throughout 2011 as we planned to shut down the LNG facility. In the third quarter of 2011, sales from the LNG facility ceased completely because we sold our equity interest in the facility.     Income from equity method investments increased $46 million in the third quarter of 2011 and $115 million in the first nine months of 2011 from the comparable prior-year periods. Higher commodity prices positively impacted the earnings of our equity method investees.     Net gain on disposal of assets in the third quarter of 2011 primarily relates to sales of assets in Alaska, including the LNG facility sale previously discussed. Net gain on disposal of assets in the first nine months of 2011 also includes a gain of $37 million from assigning a 30 percent undivided working interest in the Niobrara Shale play, where we remain operator. The gain in the first nine months of 2010 primarily related to the $811 million gain on the sale of a 20 percent outside-operated undivided interest in our E&P segment’s Production Sharing and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola.     Cost of revenues increased $493 million and $1,287 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 from the comparable periods of 2010 primarily due to our supply optimization activities. WTI prices increased 17 percent for the third quarter and 23 percent in the first nine months of 2011.     OSM segment costs increased in total for the third quarter primarily because the Jackpine mine and upgrader expansion operated for the first full quarter. Although gross costs are up due to the increased volumes handled by the expansion, per barrel costs have been declining in comparison with 2010. OSM segment costs also increased in the first nine months of 2011 when compared to the same periods of 2010 due the expansion’s operation start-up costs. These increases were partially offset by no turnaround costs in 2011. We incurred $99 million in the first nine months of 2010 associated with the turnaround. Additionally, estimated net costs of $64 million were recorded in the second quarter of 2011 to address water flow in a previously mined and contained area of the Muskeg River mine.     Purchases from related parties increased $52 million in first nine months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. Our most significant related party purchases are from the Alba gas plant in Equatorial Guinea in which we own an equity interest. Higher liquid hydrocarbon prices in 2011 increased the value of those purchases.     Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) decreased $13 million in the third quarter and increased $340 million in the first nine months of 2011 from the comparable prior-year periods. Because both our E&P and OSM segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, the previously discussed increases or decreases in sales volumes generally result in similar changes in DD&A. Decreased DD&A in the third quarter reflects the impact of lower E&P segment sales volumes, partially offset by increases in the OSM segment. For the nine-month period, DD&A increased in both the OSM and E&P segments, despite lower sales volumes in the E&P segment. The DD&A rate (expense per barrel of oil equivalent), which is impacted by changes in reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes in our DD&A. A higher DD&A rate per barrel related to our domestic E&P operations offset the impact of lower sales volumes. The following table provides DD&A rates for our E&P and OSM segments.

In 2010, impairments were primarily related to the Powder River Basin in the amount of $423 million. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these impairments.     General and administrative expenses increased $43 million in the first nine months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 primarily due to additional compensation expense. The first nine months of 2011 also includes higher costs of stock awards due to increased stock price of Marathon before the spin-off.     Other taxes increased $15 million and $25 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. With the increase in revenues, particularly related to higher prices, production and ad valorem taxes also increased.     Exploration expenses were higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 than in the same periods of 2010, primarily due to higher dry well costs. Dry well costs in the third quarter of 2011 included the final costs of the Earb well in Norway which was deemed dry in the second quarter of 2011 and some domestic onshore wells, while dry well costs for the third quarter of 2010 were minimal. Dry wells related to Norway, Indonesia and the Gulf of Mexico for the first nine months of 2011 and to the Gulf of Mexico, Equatorial Guinea and Alaska in the first nine months of 2010. Geologic and seismic costs have increased in 2011 primarily related to the U.S. shale plays and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. The following table summaries these components of exploration expenses.

See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these transactions.     Provision for income taxes increased $331 million and $293 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 from the comparable periods of 2010.     The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for the first nine months of 2011 and 2010:           Nine Months Ended September 30,          2011       2010      Statutory U.S. income tax rate      35  %     35  %   Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits      7       19     Change in permanent reinvestment assertion      7       -     Adjustments to valuation allowances      11       -     Tax law changes      2       2     Other tax effects      2       (1 )    Effective income tax rate for continuing operations      64  %     55  %     As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements, we suspended production operations in Libya in the first quarter of 2011, where the statutory tax rate is in excess of 90 percent. As a result, the effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate decreased in the first nine months of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. This decrease was partially offset by a deferred tax charge of $122 million related to an internal restructuring of our international subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2011.   The ability to realize the benefit of foreign tax credits is based on certain estimates concerning future operating conditions (particularly as related to prevailing liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil prices), future financial conditions, income generated from foreign sources and Marathon Oil's tax profile in the years that such credits may be claimed. During the third quarter of 2011 these estimates were revised. The valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets has increased because it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all foreign tax credit benefits recorded on taxes being accrued in 2011.   In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded $716 million of deferred U.S. tax on undistributed earnings of $2,046 million that we previously intended to permanently reinvest in foreign operations. Offsetting this tax expense were associated foreign tax credits of $488 million. In addition, we reduced our valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits by $228 million due to recognizing deferred U.S. tax on previously undistributed earnings.        30          In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a valuation allowance of $18 million on our deferred tax assets related to state operating loss carryforwards. Due to the spin-off (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), we have determined it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all recorded deferred tax assets.    The effective tax rate is also influenced by a variety of factors including the geographical and functional sources of income, the relative magnitude of these sources of income, foreign currency remeasurement effects, and tax legislation changes. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of items impacting our effective tax rate.   The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in corporate and other unallocated items.     Discontinued operations reflect the June 30, 2011 spin-off of our downstream businesses and the historical results of those operations, net of tax, for all periods presented.     Segment Results   Segment income (loss) is summarized in the following table:           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      (In millions)     2011       2010       2011       2010      E&P                             United States    $ 81     $ 99     $ 237     $ 233      International      249       411       1,362       1,211      E&P segment      330       510       1,599       1,444                                        OSM      92       18       193       (59 )   IG      55       41       158       109                                         Segment income      477       569       1,950       1,494     Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes:                                     Corporate and other unallocated items      (79 )     (50 )     (215 )     (130 )    Foreign currency remeasurement of income taxes      23       (37 )     6       33      Impairments      -       (15 )     (195 )     (286 )    Loss on early extinguishment of debt      -       -       (176 )     (57 )    Tax effect of subsidiary restructuring      -       -       (122 )     -      Deferred income tax items      (15 )     -       (65 )     (45 )    Water abatement - Oil Sands      -       -       (48 )     -      Gain on dispositions      (1 )     -       23       449      Income from continuing operations      405       467       1,158       1,458      Discontinued operations      -       229       1,239       404     Net income    $ 405     $ 696     $ 2,397     $ 1,862       United States E&P income decreased $18 million in the third quarter and increased $4 million in the first nine months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. The income decrease in both the third quarter of 2011 was primarily the result of lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes, increased production costs and exploration expenses, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations. For the nine-month period, the increase in liquid hydrocarbon realizations and sales volumes were partially offset by increased DD&A, production costs, exploration expenses and lower derivative revenue.     International E&P income decreased $162 million in the third quarter and increased $151 million in the first nine months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. Segment income, before taxes, increased in both periods primarily due to 40 percent and 38 percent higher liquid hydrocarbon price realizations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. Decreased sales volumes, as previously discussed, partially offset the benefit of higher realizations, but higher income taxes had the most significant impact on decreasing segment income. As previously discussed, in the third quarter of 2011, a valuation allowance was recorded on our deferred tax assets, as it is more likely than not we will be unable to realize all foreign tax credit benefits recorded on taxes accrued in 2011.     OSM segment income increased $74 million and $252 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. As previously discussed, higher sales volumes and synthetic crude realizations in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2011 were the primary reasons for the increase in income. This was partially offset by increased costs and higher DD&A.          31          IG segment income increased $14 million and $49 million in the third quarter of 2011 and first nine months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. Third quarter 2011 income also includes the gain on sale of our interest in the Alaska LNG production facility. In Equatorial Guinea, higher third quarter earnings from our equity method investment in Atlantic Methanol Production Company were due to higher methanol sales volumes and realizations. The LNG facility in Equatorial Guinea had operational availability of 97 percent for the third quarter of 2010, but realized prices were below 2010 levels.       Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows and Liquidity     Cash Flows     Net cash provided by continuing operations totaled $4,400 million in the first nine months of 2011, compared to $3,099 million in the first nine months of 2010 reflecting primarily the impact of higher liquid hydrocarbon prices on operating income.     Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,611 million in the first nine months of 2011, compared to $2,256 million in the first nine months of 2010. Significant investing activities are additions to property, plant and equipment and disposal of assets. In the first nine months of 2011, most of the additions were in the E&P segment with continued spending on U.S. unconventional resource plays and drilling in Norway, Indonesia and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. This compares to spending in the first nine months of 2010 which was more focused upon the U.S., particularly the Gulf of Mexico. Spending has slowed compared to 2010 in our OSM segment as the upgrader portion of AOSP Expansion 1 was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter 2011. In the first nine months of 2010, the majority of sales proceeds were from the sale of a portion of our interest in Block 32 offshore Angola. Deposits totaling $120 million were paid in the first nine months of 2011 related to the Eagle Ford shale acreage acquisitions.      For further information regarding capital expenditures by segment, see Supplemental Statistics.     Net cash used in financing activities was $2,182 million in the first nine months of 2011, compared to $1,146 million in the first nine months of 2010. Dividends paid were a significant use of cash in both periods. During the first quarter of 2011, we retired $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our debt. In the first nine months of 2010, we retired $500 million aggregate principal value of debt. In connection with the spin-off, we distributed $1.6 billion to MPC in the second quarter of 2011.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, our $3.0 billion committed revolving credit facility and sales of non-core assets. Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, share repurchase program, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.     Capital Resources   At September 30, 2011, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility.   Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 2 percent at September 30, 2011, compared to 14 percent at December 31, 2010. This cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio will increase in the fourth quarter of 2011 upon completion of the Eagle Ford shale acreage and gathering system acquisitions. This includes $217 million of debt that is serviced by United States Steel Corporation (“United States Steel”). United States Steel has issued calls for the fourth quarter of 2011 on the environmental revenue bonds.           32                    September 30,       December 31,      (In millions)     2011       2010       Long-term debt due within one year     $ 338     $ 295      Long-term debt      4,705       7,601                         Total debt    $ 5,043     $ 7,896                         Cash     $ 4,633     $ 3,951      Equity    $ 16,756     $ 23,771                         Calculation:                                        Total debt    $ 5,043     $ 7,896      Minus cash      4,633       3,951                         Total debt minus cash    $ 410     $ 3,945                         Total debt      5,043       7,896      Plus equity      16,756       23,771      Minus cash      4,633       3,951                         Total debt plus equity minus cash    $ 17,166     $ 27,716                         Cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio      2 %     14 %                        Capital Requirements     During the fourth quarter of 2011, we are closing the Eagle Ford shale acreage and gathering system acquisitions for approximately $4.5 billion, including projected closing adjustments and future carrying costs. The acquisitions will be funded largely from existing cash balances.     On October 26, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of 15 cents per share for the third quarter of 2011, payable December 12, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2011.     Since January 2006, our Board of Directors has authorized a common share repurchase program totaling $5 billion. As of September 30, 2011, we had repurchased 78 million common shares at a cost of $3,222 million, with 12 million shares at a cost of $300 million acquired in the third quarter of 2011. Purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. The program’s authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables. The timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales, cash from available borrowings and market conditions.     Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The completion of the agreements to purchase assets in the Eagle Ford shale formation is subject to customary closing conditions. The forward-looking statements about our common stock repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, and natural gas, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production and mining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.          33         Contractual Cash Obligations   The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of September 30, 2011:              2012-       2014-      Later      (In millions)     Total       2011        2013       2015      Years      Long-term debt (excludes interest)(a)    $ 5,035     $ 232     $ 346     $ 137     $ 4,320     Sale-leaseback financing                                            Capital lease obligations(a)      50       -       23       2       25     Operating lease obligations(a)      261       15       75       57       114     Operating lease obligations under sublease(a)                                            Purchase obligations:                                            Crude oil and feedstock contracts      76       10       62       3       1     Transportation and related contracts      1,198       97       222       153       726     Contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment      2,641       347       617       568       1,109     LNG terminal operating costs(b)      123       3       26       26       68     Service and materials contracts(c)      890       62       308       122       398     Unconditional purchase obligations(d)      40       8       16       16       -     Commitments for oil and gas exploration                                             (non-capital)(e)      37       27       4       1       5     Other long-term liabilities reported                                             in the consolidated balance sheet(f)      2,800       233       863       717       987     Total contractual cash obligations(g)    $ 13,151     $ 1,034     $ 2,562     $ 1,802     $ 7,753         (a)   Includes debt and lease obligations assumed by United States Steel upon the USX Separation.        (b)   We have the right to deliver 58 bcf of natural gas per year to the Elba Island LNG re-gasification terminal. The agreement’s primary term ends in 2021. Pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the terminal.        (c)   Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.        (d)   We are party to a long-term transportation services agreement with Alliance Pipeline. This agreement was used by Alliance Pipeline to secure its financing.        (e)   Commitments for oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs.        (f)   Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2019. Also includes amounts for uncertain tax positions.        (g)   This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties.        Receivable from United States Steel   We remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for $221 million of certain debt and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment (see the USX Separation in Item 1. of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K). United States Steel has issued calls on the environmental revenue bonds the fourth quarter of 2011. United States Steel reported in its Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2011 that it believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future.     Environmental Matters     We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes.     In August 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”) published proposed New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) that will both amend existing NSPS and NESHAP standards for oil and gas facilities as well as create a new NSPS for oil and gas production, transmission and distribution facilities. If the proposed rules are finalized without substantial modification, compliance          34        with the rules will result in an increase in costs of control, equipment, and labor, and require additional notification, monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping. The U.S. EPA is required to finalize the rule by April of 2012.     In July 2011, the U.S. EPA finalized a Federal Implementation Plan under the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) that includes New Source Review (“NSR”) regulations which apply to air emissions sources on Tribal Lands. This rule became effective on August 30, 2011, and requires the registration and/or pre-construction permitting of most of our facilities on Tribal Lands in Wyoming, Oklahoma, and North Dakota. With respect to these facilities, the U.S. EPA has determined that pre-construction permitting is required under the new rules. We do not agree with this assessment and are continuing to work with the U.S. EPA to resolve. However, to minimize pre-construction delays in the near term, we entered into an Administrative Compliance and Consent Agreement (“Agreement”) that temporarily suspended the requirement for pre-construction permits for facilities on Tribal Lands in North Dakota as long as permit applications were filed in accordance with the Agreement (discussed further in Legal Proceedings). We cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these new permitting requirements until the U.S. EPA finalizes its internal permitting procedures and expected challenges to the new NSR regulations are resolved.     There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2010.     Other Contingencies     We are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.      During the second quarter of 2011, the AOSP operator determined the need and developed preliminary plans to address water flow into a previously mined and contained section of the Muskeg River mine. Our share of the estimated costs in the amount of $64 million was recorded to cost of revenues. At September 30, 2011, the remaining liability is $56 million.     Critical Accounting Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.     Certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.     There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates related to continuing operations subsequent to December 31, 2010.     Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted     In September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended accounting standards to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment. The amendments reduce complexity by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation of whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The amendment is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning with the first quarter of 2012. Early adopting is permitted, but we were unable to do so because our annual goodwill impairment testing was completed prior to the issuance of the amendment. Adoption of this amendment will not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.   The FASB amended the reporting standards for comprehensive income in June 2011 to eliminate the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. All non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity are required to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income. The presentation of items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net on the income statement is also required. The amendments did not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The amendments are effective for us beginning with the first quarter of 2012. We are still evaluating this reporting         35         standard, but we do not expect adoption of this amendment to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     In May 2011, the FASB issued an update amending the accounting standards for fair value measurement and disclosure, resulting in common principles and requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The amendments change the wording used to describe certain of the U.S. GAAP requirements either to clarify the intent of existing requirements, to change measurement or expand disclosure principles or to conform to the wording used in IFRS. The amendments are to be applied prospectively and will be effective for our interim and annual periods beginning with the first quarter of 2012. Early application is not permitted. We do not expect adoption of these amendments to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Disclosures about how derivatives are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how the fair values of our derivative instruments are measured may be found in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.     The majority of our previous derivative activity was conducted by our downstream business. Sensitivity of the commodity derivatives and interest rate swaps related to continuing operations has not changed significantly.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures     An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarter ended September 30, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.          36      MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited)             Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended          September 30,       September 30,      (In millions)     2011       2010       2011       2010                                         Segment Income (Loss)                                     Exploration and Production                                     United States    $ 81     $ 99     $ 237     $ 233      International      249       411       1,362       1,211      E&P segment      330       510       1,599       1,444      Oil Sands Mining      92       18       193       (59 )    Integrated Gas      55       41       158       109      Segment income      477       569       1,950       1,494      Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes      (72 )     (102 )     (792 )     (36 )    Income from continuing operations      405       467       1,158       1,458      Discontinued operations      -

Legal Proceedings   We are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain of these matters are discussed below.   In March 2011, Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (“Noble”) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Harris County, Texas alleging, among other things, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent misrepresentation, relating to a multi-year drilling contract for a newly constructed drilling rig to be deployed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We filed an answer in April 2011, contending, among other things, failure to perform, failure to comply with material obligations, failure to mitigate alleged damages and that Noble failed to provide the rig according to the operating, performance and safety requirements specified in the drilling contract. Noble is seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are vigorously defending this litigation. The ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, including any financial effect on us, remains uncertain. We do not believe an estimate of a reasonably probable loss (or range of loss) can be made for this lawsuit at this time.     Environmental Proceedings   As discussed in Item-2: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Environmental Matters, in August 2011, we entered into an Administrative Compliance and Consent Agreement with the U.S. EPA that temporarily suspended the requirement for pre-construction permits for our well pad facilities on Tribal Lands in North Dakota as long as permit applications were filed in accordance with the schedule set forth in this Agreement. We also agreed to pay $294,000 in settlement of this matter, which also provided coverage for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.   We have been working with the North Dakota Department of Health to resolve voluntary disclosures we made in 2009 relating to potential Clean Air Act violations relating to our operations on State lands in the Bakken. The amount of the potential fine is estimated to be $100,000.     SEC Investigation Relating to Libya   On May 25, 2011 we received a subpoena issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requiring the production of documents related to payments made to the government of Libya, or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of Libya. We have been and intend to continue cooperating with the SEC in its investigation.     Item 1A. Risk Factors   We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following is an update to our risk factors.     The potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.    Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process. Consideration of new federal regulation and increased state oversight continues to arise. The U.S. EPA announced in the first quarter of 2010 its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. The U.S. EPA has begun preparation for the study and expects to complete the study in 2012. In addition, various state-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale gas resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing.   Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a          39         decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
