Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Activities related to discontinued operations in Gabon and Ireland have been excluded from segment results and operating statistics.     Overview and Outlook   Exploration and Production (“E&P”)  Production   Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales averaged 366 and 396 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”) during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to 367 and 357 mboepd during the third quarter and first nine months of 2008. Sales increases in the first nine months of 2009 over the same period of 2008 primarily reflect the impact of liquid hydrocarbon production from the Alvheim/Vilje development offshore Norway which commenced production in mid-2008 and natural gas sales in Equatorial Guinea.     We continue to make progress on well completions at the Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Block 244. Work is under way to tie back to the third-party operated Bullwinkle platform. First production is targeted for mid-2010. We hold a 100 percent operated working interest and an 81 percent net revenue interest in Droshky.     In September 2009, the Volund field offshore Norway produced first oil. This is the second major field tied to our Alvheim floating production, storage and offloading (“FPSO”) vessel. While we expect our net share of the field’s peak oil production to be 16,000 bpd, the timing of future production is subject to available processing capacity on the Alvheim FPSO. The first Volund well is functioning as a swing producer to the FPSO until there is some natural decline in the Alvheim field production. We hold a 65 percent operated interest in the Volund field.     Also offshore Norway, our partners announced the Marihone discovery, which is the first of five prospects near the Alvheim FPSO with tie back potential. The Marihone oil discovery is located in license PL340 about 12 miles south of the Volund and Alvheim fields. We hold a 65 percent operated working interest in Marihone.     We hold approximately 335,000 acres over the Bakken Shale play in North Dakota. We currently have three rigs running in our Bakken program and plan to add a fourth rig in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net production from Bakken in the third quarter of 2009 amounted to approximately 11 mboepd compared to 7 mboepd in the same quarter of 2008.         23     Index   Exploration   During the third quarter of 2009, we announced the Tebe discovery on Block 31 offshore Angola. We hold a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 31 and a 30 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32, pending the sale of two-thirds of our Block 32 interest as discussed below.     During the second quarter of 2009, we were awarded all 16 blocks bid in the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale No. 208 conducted by the Minerals Management Service. Ten blocks are 100 percent Marathon, and the remaining six blocks were bid with partners, for a total of $62 million. We have acquired a total of 59 new leases from lease sales held 2007 through 2009.     In the second quarter of 2009, we were awarded a 49 percent interest and will serve as operator in the Kumawa Block offshore Indonesia, our third Indonesian offshore exploration block. The Kumawa Block encompasses 1.24 million acres.     The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of future production and anticipated future drilling activity. Some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.     Divestitures     During 2009, we have disposed of our exploration and production businesses in Ireland and certain producing assets in the Permian Basin of New Mexico and Texas. At September 30, 2009, agreements are pending to dispose of our exploration and production business in Gabon and certain assets under development in Angola. Our Irish and Gabonese exploration and production businesses have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and the consolidated statements of cash flows for all periods presented. Assets and liabilities related to the Gabonese business are classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2009.     In August 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell our operated fields offshore Gabon for $282 million, excluding any purchase price adjustments at closing, with an effective date of January 1, 2009. We expect to close the transaction by year-end 2009.     In July 2009, we entered into an agreement to sell an undivided 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola for $1.3 billion, excluding any purchase price adjustments at closing, with an effective date of January 1, 2009. We will retain a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32. We expect to close the transaction by year-end 2009, subject to government and regulatory approvals.     In June 2009, we closed the sales of a portion of our operated and all of our outside-operated Permian Basin producing assets in New Mexico and west Texas for net proceeds after closing adjustments of $293 million. A $196 million pretax gain on the sale was recorded. Net production from these operations averaged 8,150 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“boepd”) in the first quarter of 2009. Our net proved reserves associated with these assets as of December 31, 2008, were 14 million barrels of oil equivalent (“mmboe”).     In April 2009, we closed the sale of our operated properties in Ireland for net proceeds of $84 million, after adjusting for cash held by the sold subsidiary. A $158 million pretax gain on the sale was recorded. Net production from these operations averaged 5,000 boepd in the first quarter of 2009. Our net proved reserves associated with these assets as of December 31, 2008, were 6 million barrels of oil equivalent (“mmboe”). As a result of this sale, we terminated our pension plan in Ireland, incurring a charge of $18 million which reduced the gain on sale.     In June 2009 we entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiary holding our 19 percent outside-operated interest in the Corrib natural gas development offshore Ireland. Total proceeds will range between $235 million and $400 million, subject to the timing of first commercial gas at Corrib and closing adjustments. The fair value of the consideration for this asset was $311 million, which was less than its book value. A $154 million impairment of the held for sale asset was recognized in discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2009 (see Note 11 and Note 4). At closing on July 30, 2009, the initial $100 million payment plus closing adjustments was received. Additional proceeds of $135 million to $300 million will be received on the earlier of first commercial gas or December 31, 2012.     The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to pending divestitures. The divestitures could be adversely affected by customary closing conditions or affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals. The divestiture in Gabon could be further affected by consultation          24     Index     with the Gabonese government. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.    Oil Sands Mining (“OSM”)  Our bitumen production was 27 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) in the third quarter and 26 mbpd in the first nine months of 2009.   The Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”) Phase 1 expansion is on track and anticipated to begin mining operations in the second half of 2010, and upgrader operations in late 2010 or early 2011.     In October, the Government of Canada and Government of Alberta jointly announced their intent to partially fund AOSP’s Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (“Quest CCS”) project. Under the terms of their letters of intent, the Government of Alberta would contribute 745 million Canadian dollars and the Government of Canada would provide 120 million Canadian dollars toward the project’s development. A final investment decision on the Quest CCS project will be made at a later date, and is subject to regulatory approvals, stakeholder engagement, detailed engineering studies, as well as a final joint venture partner agreement. Marathon has a 20 percent interest in AOSP.     In the second quarter of 2009, the operator of AOSP offered three additional leases to the other joint venture partners for the Muskeg River Mine. Terms of the transaction were as agreed in the original 1999 AOSP Joint Venture Agreement. We elected to participate in these leases and our net proved reserves increased 168 million barrels.     The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the start of operations of the AOSP Phase 1 expansion. Factors that could affect the project are transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. The foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by commissioning and start-up risks associated with proto-type equipment and new technology.    Refining, Marketing and Transportation (“RM&T”)   Our total refinery throughputs were 4 percent higher in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008, but were relatively flat for the nine-month periods of the same years. Crude oil refined increased 7 percent in the third quarter of 2009. Lower throughputs in 2008 resulted primarily from weather-related events. Planned major maintenance activities were completed at our Canton, Ohio; Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Robinson, Illinois, and Garyville, Louisiana, refineries in the first nine months of 2009. In the first nine months of 2008, major maintenance activities occurred at our Detroit, Michigan; Garyville and Robinson refineries.     Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline increased to an average of 62 mbpd for the third quarter of 2009, an 8 percent increase over the same period of 2008. For the first nine months of 2009 we blended an average of 59 mbpd, or 15 percent more ethanol than in the same period of 2008. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of ethanol supply and government regulations.     Third quarter 2009 Speedway SuperAmerica LLC (“SSA”) same store gasoline sales volume increased 3 percent when compared to the third quarter of 2008, while same store merchandise sales increased by 12 percent for the same period.     As of October 31, 2009, the expansion of our Garyville, Louisiana refinery is approximately 98 percent complete with an on-schedule startup expected late in the fourth quarter 2009. This expansion will increase the Garyville refinery’s crude oil refining capacity by 180,000 bpd, improving scale efficiencies and feedstock flexibility. We now forecast that the project will cost between $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion. In early January 2010, we plan to commence an extended turnaround at the existing base refinery in Garyville. The entire facility (base and expansion) is expected to reach full refining capacity by the second quarter of 2010.     Construction activities continue on the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery with completion expected in the last half of 2012.     The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the Garyville and Detroit refinery expansion projects. Factors that could affect those projects include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.   Integrated Gas (“IG”)   Our share of LNG sales worldwide totaled 6,372 metric tonnes per day (“mtpd”) for the third quarter of 2009 compared to 6,048 mtpd in the third quarter of 2008 and 6,583 mtpd in the first nine months of 2009 compared to 6,453          25     Index     mtpd in the first nine months of 2008. These LNG sales volumes include both consolidated sales volumes and our share of the sales volumes of equity method investees. LNG sales from Alaska are conducted through a consolidated subsidiary. LNG and methanol sales from Equatorial Guinea are conducted through equity method investees.     We continue to invest in the development of new technologies to create value and supply new energy sources. In the first nine months of 2009, we recorded costs of approximately $45 million related to natural gas technology research, including our GTFTM technology. Similar spending in the same period of 2008 was $59 million.     Market Conditions    Exploration and Production   Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices continue to be volatile in 2009, with the following table listing benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 and 2008 to illustrate the volatility:           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      Benchmark     2009       2008       2009       2008      West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 68.24     $ 118.22     $ 57.32     $ 113.52     Brent crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 68.08     $ 115.09     $ 57.32     $ 111.11     Henry Hub natural gas (Dollars per mmbtu)(a)    $ 3.39     $ 10.25     $ 3.93     $ 9.74           (a)     First-of-month price index per million British thermal units.       On average, crude oil prices in 2009 were lower than in 2008. Crude oil prices declined rapidly to lows around $40 per barrel in February 2009 from a high of over $140 per barrel in July 2008. By September 2009 prices had increased to near $70 per barrel.     Our domestic crude oil production is on average heavier and higher in sulfur content than light sweet WTI. Heavier and higher sulfur crude oil (commonly referred to as heavy sour crude oil) typically sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil. Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally priced in relation to the Brent crude oil benchmark.     Natural gas prices on average were also lower in 2009 than in 2008. Our natural gas sales in Alaska are subject to term contracts. Our other major natural gas-producing regions are Europe and Equatorial Guinea, where large portions of our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. As we sell larger quantities of natural gas from these regions, to the extent that these fixed prices are lower than prevailing prices, our reported average natural gas price realizations may decrease.     Our worldwide E&P revenues during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 were 47 and 46 percent lower than in the same periods of 2008, with the majority of the revenue decreases tied to these decreases in average commodity prices.     Oil Sands Mining   OSM segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce. Approximately two-thirds of our normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil marker, primarily Western Canadian Select. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader.     The operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per unit costs are sensitive to production rates. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively.     The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 and 2008:         26     Index             Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      Benchmark     2009       2008       2009       2008      WTI crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 68.24     $ 118.22     $ 57.32     $ 113.52     Western Canadian Select (Dollars per barrel)(a)    $ 58.05     $ 100.22     $ 48.47     $ 93.16     AECO natural gas sales index (Canadian dollars per gigajoule)(b)    $ 2.78     $ 7.45     $ 3.59     $ 8.19           (a)    Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada.          (b)    Monthly average of Alberta Energy Company day ahead index.        Excluding the impact of derivatives, our OSM segment revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 were lower than for the same periods of 2008, reflecting the impact of lower price realizations for synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil sales. Realizations were 45 percent lower in the third quarter and 51 percent lower for the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same periods of 2008.     Refining, Marketing and Transportation     RM&T segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, refinery throughputs, retail marketing gross margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise, and the profitability of our pipeline transportation operations.     Our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between spot market prices at major trading locations for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as an indicator of the impact of price on the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads that we feel most closely track our operations and slate of products. Posted Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of crude oil refined into 3 barrels of gasoline, 2 barrels of distillate and 1 barrel of residual fuel) are used for the crack spread calculation. The following table lists calculated average crack spreads for the Midwest and Gulf Coast markets and the sweet/sour differential for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 and 2008:            Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      (Dollars per barrel)     2009       2008       2009       2008      Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread    $ 3.93     $ 7.81     $ 4.20     $ 3.59     U.S. Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread    $ 2.50     $ 6.32     $ 2.99     $ 3.26     Sweet/Sour differential(a)    $ 5.64     $ 11.38     $ 5.62     $ 12.64           (a)   Calculated using the following mix of crude types: 15% Arab Light, 20% Kuwait, 10% Maya, 15% Western Canadian Select, 40% Mars.       In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:         ·    the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed,          ·    the selling prices realized for refined products,          ·    the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to manage price risk,          ·    the cost of products purchased for resale, and          ·    changes in manufacturing costs, which include depreciation.        Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which may enhance our margin compared to what the change in the relevant crack spread indicators would suggest, as sour crude oil typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount can and does vary significantly and can therefore have a significant impact on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin. Manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries and the level of maintenance activities.         27     Index     Our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 was 70 percent and 29 percent lower when compared to the same periods of 2008, consistent with changes in crack spreads, with the significantly reduced sweet/sour differential adding to the unfavorable impact.     Integrated Gas     Our integrated gas strategy is to link stranded natural gas resources with areas where a supply gap is emerging due to declining production and growing demand. Our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, primarily in the U.S., Europe and West Africa.     Our most significant LNG investment is our 60 percent ownership in a production facility in Equatorial Guinea, which sells LNG under a long-term contract at prices tied to Henry Hub natural gas prices.     We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Equatorial Guinea through our investment in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”). AMPCO’s plant capacity is 1.1 million tones per annum, or 3 percent of 2008 world demand. Also included in the financial results of the Integrated Gas segment are costs associated with ongoing development of integrated gas projects, including natural gas technology research.     The impact of lower Henry Hub prices in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008 can be seen in decreased earnings from the LNG production facility although the production levels increased over the same periods. Our methanol realizations were also down during the third quarter, in line with global methanol prices.        Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations                                       Consolidated Results of Operations                                                        Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table:                                   Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended        September 30,     September 30,      (In millions)   2009     2008     2009     2008      E&P    $ 1,979     $ 3,728     $ 5,386     $ 9,947     OSM      167       600       444       815     RM&T      12,407       18,766       32,148       52,767     IG      15       24       33       64                                         Segment revenues      14,568       23,118       38,011       63,593                                        Elimination of intersegment revenues      (193 )     (347 )     (506 )     (1,050 )   Gain (loss) on U.K. natural gas contracts      (13 )     198       72       (37 )                                       Total revenues    $ 14,362     $ 22,969     $ 37,577     $ 62,506                                        Items included in both revenues and costs:                                                                        Consumer excise taxes on petroleum products                                     and merchandise    $ 1,258     $ 1,273     $ 3,658     $ 3,784        E&P segment revenues decreased $1,749 million in the third quarter and $4,561 million in the first nine months of 2009 from the comparable prior-year periods. The decreases were primarily a result of lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas price realizations. Liquid hydrocarbon realizations averaged $64.12 per barrel in the third quarter and $53.62 in the first nine months of 2009 compared to $110.69 and $104.05 in the same periods of 2008, while natural gas realizations averaged $2.20 per mcf in the third quarter and $2.42 in the first nine months of 2009 compared to $5.09 and $4.88 in the same periods of 2008.     Net sales volumes during the quarter were flat when compared to the same period last year, averaging 366 mboepd in 2009 and 367 mboepd in 2008. Net sales volumes for the first nine months of 2009 were 11 percent higher than the comparable prior-year period, primarily impacted by liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from the Alvheim/Vilje field which commenced production in mid-2008. This increase in sales volumes partially offsets the impact of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas realization decreases previously discussed.     See Supplemental Statistics for information regarding net sales volumes and average realizations by geographic area.         28     Index     Excluded from E&P segment revenues were losses of $13 million and gains of $198 million for the third quarters of 2009 and 2008 related to natural gas sales contracts in the U.K. accounted for as derivative instruments. For the first nine months of 2009 and 2008 gains of $72 million and losses of $37 million are excluded from E&P segment revenues. These derivative instruments expired in September 2009.     OSM segment revenues decreased $433 million in the third quarter and $371 million in the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008. The crude oil options we entered in the first quarter of 2009 effectively offset the open put options for the remainder of 2009. As a result, the impact of derivatives in 2009 was insignificant compared to pretax derivative gains of $255 million in the third quarter and losses of $131 million in the first nine months of 2008. Net synthetic crude sales for the third quarter of 2009 were 33 mbpd at an average realized price of $62.08 per barrel compared to 32 mbpd at an average realized price of $113.42 in the same period last year.     See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative instruments.     RM&T segment revenues decreased $6,359 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $20,619 million in the first nine months of 2009 from the comparable prior-year periods. The third quarter and the nine month decreases compared to prior year primarily reflect lower refined product selling prices.     Sales to related parties decreased as a result of the sale of our interest in Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“PTC”) during the fourth quarter of 2008.     Income from equity method investments decreased $195 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $551 million in the first nine months of 2009 from the comparable prior-year periods. Lower commodity prices negatively impacted the earnings of many of our equity investees. The sale of our equity method investment in PTC during the fourth quarter of 2008 also contributed to the decrease.     Net gain on disposal of assets in the first nine months of 2009 primarily represents the sale of a portion of our operated and all of our outside-operated Permian Basin producing assets in New Mexico and west Texas.     Cost of revenues decreased $6,015 million and $21,262 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 from the comparable prior-year periods. These decreases resulted primarily from decreases in acquisition costs of crude oil, refinery charge and blendstocks and purchased refined products in the RM&T segment.     Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) increased in third quarter and first nine months of 2009 from the comparable prior-year periods. The DD&A increase is primarily due to the commencement of production from the Alvheim/Vilje and Neptune developments in mid-year 2008 combined with the impact of a reduction in the Neptune field reserves in the first quarter of 2009.     Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 from the comparable prior-year periods primarily due to lower compensation expenses.     Exploration expenses were $55 million and $181 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, including expenses related to dry wells of $10 million and $22 million. Exploration expenses were $108 million and $367 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008, including expenses related to dry wells of $24 million and $106 million. Other exploration expenses incurred in the first nine months of 2008 related to the acquisition of seismic data in Indonesia and the evaluation of Canadian in-situ oil sands leases.     Provision for income taxes decreased $1,011 million and $1,400 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 from the comparable periods of 2008. Changes in our provision for income taxes are driven by the decrease in income before income taxes and changes in our effective income tax rate. The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for the first nine months of 2009 and 2008:             Nine Months Ended September 30,            2009       2008      Statutory U.S. income tax rate      35  %     35  %   Foreign taxes in excess of federal statutory rate      25       11     State and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effects      1       1     Other tax effects      -       (1 )    Effective income tax rate      61  %     46  %    The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income, the relative magnitude of these sources of income, and foreign currency remeasurement effects. The change in mix of liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales in 2009 from 2008 resulted in more income in jurisdictions with high tax rates. Beginning in the third quarter of 2009, we are crediting certain foreign taxes that were previously treated as deductible for U.S. tax purposes. We continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Our assessments include estimates of our expected future taxable income and assumptions about matters that are dependent on future          29     Index   events. These future events include, but are not limited to, future operating and financial conditions. The 2009 effective tax rate increased due to a change in judgment about the realizability of a portion our deferred tax asset related to U.S. foreign tax credits generated during the year. These changes, as well as unfavorable foreign currency remeasurement effects, contributed to the increase in the effective income tax rate in the first nine months of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.   Discontinued operations reflect the current year disposal of our E&P businesses in Ireland and Gabon (see Note 4) and the historical results of those operations, net of tax, for all periods presented.       Segment Results                                             Segment income is summarized in the following table:                                     Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended          September 30,       September 30,      (In millions)     2009       2008       2009       2008      E&P                                                        United States    $ 32     $ 285     $ (61 )   $ 888      International      459       584       843       1,428                                         E&P segment      491       869       782       2,316                                        OSM      25       288       3       158                                        RM&T      158       771       482       854                                        IG      13       65       53       266                                         Segment income      687       1,993       1,320       3,594     Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes:                                     Corporate and other unallocated items      (159 )     (178 )     (299 )     (253 )    Foreign currency remeasurement of deferred taxes      (114 )     76       (180 )     111      Gain (loss) on U.K. natural gas contracts      (7 )     101       37       (19 )    Gain on disposal of assets      (15 )     -       107       -      Discontinued operations      21       72       123       136                                        Net income    $ 413     $ 2,064     $ 1,108     $ 3,569        United States E&P income decreased $253 million and $949 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008. Revenues decreased approximately 49 percent in the third quarter and 55 percent in the first nine months of 2009, primarily as a result of lower realizations on both liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. Liquid hydrocarbon sales were flat in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008. Natural gas sales for both periods were lower than in the same periods of 2008 primarily due to disposition of our Permian assets, declining production in Alaska and increased storage activity in Alaska. Offsetting the losses were lower operating expenses in 2009, primarily as a result of lower ad valorem and severance taxes. Other expenses, totaling $63 million for the nine-month period, included rig cancellation fees and partial impairment of a natural gas field in east Texas and a Gulf of Mexico pipeline investment.     International E&P income decreased $125 million and $585 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008. The decreases were primarily due to over 40 percent lower liquid hydrocarbon realizations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008. Liquid hydrocarbon sales from the Alvheim/Vilje development which commenced production in June 2008 had a favorable income impact, partially offset by the DD&A related to this production. Lower exploration expenses had a positive income impact in both periods.     OSM segment income decreased $263 million and $155 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009. After-tax derivative gains of $190 million and losses of $98 million were included in reported income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008. Derivative gains or losses in 2009 were not significant. Exclusive of the derivative effects, OSM segment income reflects decreases in both periods driven by lower synthetic crude realizations, partially offset by lower energy and blendstock costs. DD&A in the third quarter of 2009 was lower than in the same period of 2008 primarily as a result of the reserves added in the second quarter of 2009.     RM&T segment income decreased by $613 million and $372 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008. The decreases were primarily due to our refining and wholesale marketing            30     Index     gross margin which averaged 7.62 cents per gallon in the third quarter of 2009 and 8.08 cents per gallon in the first nine months of 2009 compared to 25.19 cents per gallon and 11.37 cents per gallon in the comparable periods of 2008. The gross margin decrease was consistent with the declines in crack spreads as reflected in the relevant market indicators in the Midwest (Chicago) and Gulf Coast and the substantial reduction in the sweet-sour differential. However, these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by lower manufacturing and other expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 as compared to the same periods of 2008 primarily due to lower energy costs.      Our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin also included pretax derivative losses of $17 million and $64 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009 compared to gains of $156 million and losses of $151 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2008.     SSA’s total light products and merchandise margin declined $10 million in the third quarter and improved $26 million in the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008. Increased merchandise margins, resulting from higher same store sales were the primary factor contributing to the improved margins in the first nine months of 2009.     IG segment income decreased $52 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $213 million in the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same periods of 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of lower price realizations. The LNG sales contract in Equatorial Guinea has a Henry Hub basis so the approximately 67 percent decline in this index had a significant effect on LNG profitability. During the third quarter of 2009 the LNG plant was down for planned maintenance, which was completed in 14 days versus the original 18-day schedule, but higher plant reliability had a positive impact on year-over-year volumes.      Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows and Liquidity     Cash Flows     Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,906 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $4,807 million in the first nine months of 2008. Cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to lower net income, driven primarily by lower commodity prices.     Net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,764 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $4,800 million in the first nine months of 2008. Our long-term projects, such as the Garyville refinery major expansion, Expansion 1 of the AOSP, exploration offshore Angola and in the Gulf of Mexico, and development of Alvheim, the Bakken Shale resource play and the Droshky prospect, were the most significant investing activities in both periods. For further information regarding capital expenditures by segment, see Supplemental Statistics. In addition, proceeds of $573 million were generated from the sale of assets in 2009.     Net cash provided by financing activities was $926 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared to $302 million in the first nine months of 2008. Sources of cash in the first nine months of 2009 included the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes, while $1.0 billion in senior notes were issued in the first nine months of 2008. Uses of cash in the first nine months of 2008 included the repayment of $400 million 6.85 percent notes, the payment and termination of the Marathon Oil Canada Corporation (previously Western Oil Sands Inc.) revolving credit facility, and purchases of common stock. Dividends paid were a significant use of cash in both years.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations and our $3.0 billion committed revolving credit facility. Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, share repurchase program, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.   Capital Resources   At September 30, 2009, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility.      On February 17, 2009, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at 6.5 percent with a maturity date of February 15, 2014 and $800 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at 7.5 percent with a maturity date of February 15, 2019. Interest on both issues is payable semi-annually beginning August 15, 2009.     On July 26, 2007, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities.         31     Index     Our senior unsecured debt is currently rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Corporation, Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. and Fitch Ratings with ratings of BBB+, Baa1, and BBB+.  Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 25 percent at September 30, 2009, compared to 22 percent at December 31, 2008. This includes $470 million of debt that is serviced by United States Steel.

Since August 2008, we have not made any purchases under the common share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in January 2006.     Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The forward-looking statements about our common stock repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production, refining and mining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.   Contractual Cash Obligations     As of September 30, 2009, our consolidated contractual cash obligations have increased by $1,848 million from December 31, 2008. Short and long-term debt increased by $1,501 million primarily due to the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes as previously discussed. Also, our obligations under crude oil, refinery feedstock, and refined product contracts increased $509 million due mainly to price increases. There have been no other significant changes to our          32     Index     obligations to make future payments under existing contracts subsequent to December 31, 2008. The portion of our obligations to make future payments under existing contracts that have been assumed by United States Steel has not changed significantly subsequent to December 31, 2008.     Receivable from United States Steel   We remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for $494 million of certain debt and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel Corporation (“United States Steel”) has assumed responsibility for repayment (see the USX Separation in Item 1. of our 2008 Annual Report on 10-K). In its Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, United States Steel management stated that it believes its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future. During the second quarter of 2009, United States Steel undertook certain plans and actions designed to preserve and enhance its liquidity and financial flexibility, including the sale of its common stock and issuance of senior convertible notes due 2014 for net proceeds of approximately $1,496 million. United States Steel’s senior unsecured debt ratings are BB by Standard and Poor’s Corporation, Ba3 by Moody’s Investment Service, Inc. and BBB- by Fitch Ratings.    Environmental Matters   We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services or if demand for our products is lowered because of these additional costs, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, operational efficiencies, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil, refined products and feedstocks.     Legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to impact us In April of 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a proposed finding that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that may endanger public health or welfare. It is anticipated EPA will finalize this finding later this year. Related to this finding, in September of 2009, the EPA proposed a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources. This standard is expected to be finalized in the spring of 2010. The EPA has also proposed a greenhouse gas emission reporting rule which was signed by the Administrator in September to be effective for calendar year 2010. Further, in May 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (H.R. 2454) (commonly referred to as the “Waxman-Markey Bill”) which includes a cap and trade system to reduce carbon emissions in the United States. Cap and trade legislation (commonly referred to as the “Kerry-Boxer Bill”) has also been introduced into and will be considered by the U.S. Senate.     Adverse impacts to our business if a cap and trade system as in the Waxman-Markey or Kerry-Boxer Bill or some other comprehensive greenhouse gas legislation is enacted or if the EPA finalizes standards for greenhouse gas emissions, include increased compliance costs, permitting delays, substantial costs to generate or purchase emission credits or allowances adding costs to the products we produce, and reduced demand for crude oil and certain refined products. The extent and magnitude of such adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific legislative and regulatory requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the additional measures being considered and the time frames for compliance.     We have estimated that we may spend approximately $1 billion over a six-year period that began in 2008 to comply with Mobile Source Air Toxics II (“MSAT II”) regulations relating to benzene content in refined products. We have not finalized our strategy or cost estimates to comply with these requirements. Our actual MSAT II expenditures since inception have totaled $198 million through September 30, 2009, with $53 million in the third quarter of 2009. We expect 2009 spending will be approximately $220 million. The cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as further work is completed in 2009.     There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2008.     Resolved Matters     The matter of a suit by the State of Colorado’s Department of Public Health and Environment alleging violations of storm water requirements was resolved in the third quarter of 2009 with the parties paying a penalty of $280,000 of which our share was $98,000.     A previously disclosed lawsuit brought by the State of New Mexico alleging air pollution violations at our Indian Basin Natural Gas Plant has been settled in principle with the State of New Mexico. The parties are working on a consent order to finalize the settlement. The settlement requires a cash penalty of $450,000 and plant compliance projects and supplemental environmental projects estimated to cost over $5 million. We were the operator and part owner of the plant through June 2009. We are working with the other plant owners to obtain reimbursement for their share of these costs.         33     Index     The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) had issued us a notice of enforcement relating to benzene waste national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants inspection at our Texas City refinery. We resolved this matter in the second quarter of 2009 with an order including a civil penalty of $46,000. We are also required to continue to operate an ambient air monitoring system for an additional six months as a supplemental environmental project in settlement of this enforcement action brought by the TCEQ.     The matter of an EPA notice of violation for oil spills at the Catlettsburg Refinery in 2004 and 2008 was resolved in the second quarter of 2009 through an order and civil penalty of $118,000.     Other Contingencies     We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to us. However, we believe that we will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to us. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.     Critical Accounting Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.     Certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.     Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted accounting and reporting standards for fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets and liabilities. These standards define fair value, establish a fair value framework for measuring fair value and expand disclosures about fair value measurements. It does not require us to make any new fair value measurements, but rather establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques to measure fair value. See Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.     There have been no other changes to our critical accounting estimates subsequent to December 31, 2008.     Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted     Measuring liabilities at fair value, a FASB accounting standards update, was issued in August 2009. This update provides clarification for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available. In such circumstances, an entity is required to measure fair value that uses (1) the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset, or (2) quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets, or (3) another valuation technique consistent with the fair value measurement principles such as an income approach or a market approach. The new update for measuring liabilities at fair value is effective for the first reporting period (including interim periods) beginning after August 27, 2009 and is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     Variable interest accounting standards were amended by the FASB in June 2009. The new accounting standards replace the existing quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity. In addition, the concept of qualifying special-purpose entities has been eliminated and therefore, will now be evaluated for consolidation in accordance with the applicable consolidation guidance. Ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity are also required. The amended variable interest accounting standard requires reconsideration for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity when changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk, as a group, lack the power from voting rights or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity. Enhanced disclosures are required for any enterprise that holds a variable interest in a variable interest entity. Application will be prospective beginning in the first quarter of 2010, and for all interim and annual periods thereafter. Earlier application is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this statement.         34     Index       In December 2008, the SEC announced that it had approved revisions to its oil and gas reporting disclosures. The new disclosure requirements include provisions that:             ·   Introduce a new definition of oil and gas producing activities. This new definition allows companies to include volumes in their reserve base from unconventional resources. Such unconventional resources include bitumen extracted from oil sands and oil and gas extracted from coal beds and shale formations.              ·   Report oil and gas reserves using an unweighted average price using the prior 12-month period, based on the closing prices on the first day of each month, rather than year-end prices.              ·   Permit companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves on a voluntary basis. Under current rules, proved reserves are the only reserves allowed in the disclosures.              ·   Require companies to provide additional disclosure regarding the aging of proved undeveloped reserves.              ·   Permit the use of reliable technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes.              ·   Replace the existing "certainty" test for areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a productive well with a "reasonable certainty" test.              ·   Require additional disclosures regarding the qualifications of the chief technical person who oversees the company's overall reserve estimation process. Additionally, disclosures regarding internal controls surrounding reserve estimation, as well as a report addressing the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor will be mandatory.              ·   Require separate disclosure of reserves in foreign countries if they represent more than 15 percent of total proved reserves, based on barrels of oil equivalents.      We expect to begin complying with the disclosure requirements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. The new rules may not be applied to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required.     The FASB issued an exposure draft in September 2009 which aligns the FASB’s reporting requirements with the above SEC reporting requirements. The exposure draft also addresses the impact of changes in the SEC’s rules and definitions on accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Similar to the SEC requirements, the exposure draft requirements would be effective for periods ending on or after December 31, 2009. We are currently in the process of evaluating the new requirements by the SEC and awaiting the final standard from the FASB.     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Disclosures about how derivatives are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how the fair values of our derivative instruments are measured may be found in Note 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.     Item 4. Controls and Procedures     An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarter ended September 30, 2009, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.         35     Index    MARATHON OIL CORPORATION  Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited)                        Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended          September 30,       September 30,      (In millions)     2009       2008       2009       2008                                         Segment Income (Loss)                                     Exploration and Production                                     United States    $ 32     $ 285     $ (61 )   $ 888      International      459       584       843       1,428      E&P segment      491       869       782       2,316      Oil Sands Mining      25       288       3       158      Refining, Marketing and Transportation      158       771       482       854      Integrated Gas      13       65       53       266      Segment income      687       1,993       1,320       3,594                                         Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes      (274 )     71       (212 )     (25 )    Net income    $ 413     $ 2,064     $ 1,108     $ 3,569     Capital Expenditures                                     Exploration and Production    $ 516     $ 686     $ 1,490     $ 2,281      Oil Sands Mining      267       271       834       781      Refining, Marketing and Transportation      634       765       2,007       1,978      Integrated Gas       -

Legal Proceedings     We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are included below. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. However, we believe that we will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.     MTBE Litigation     We settled a number of lawsuits pertaining to methyl tertiary-butyl ether (“MTBE”) in 2008. Presently, we are a defendant, along with other refining companies, in 27 cases arising in four states alleging damages for MTBE contamination. Like the cases that were settled in 2008, 12 of the remaining cases are consolidated in a multi-district litigation (“MDL”) in the Southern District of New York for pretrial proceedings. Fourteen of the remaining cases have been filed in state courts (Nassau and Suffolk Counties, New York), some being re-filed after being dismissed from the MDL. These 12 MDL cases and 14 New York state court cases allege damages to water supply wells, similar to the damages claimed in the cases settled in 2008. In the other remaining case, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is seeking natural resources damages allegedly resulting from contamination of groundwater by MTBE. This is the only MTBE contamination case in which we are a defendant and natural resources damages are sought. We are vigorously defending these cases. We, along with a number of other defendants, have engaged in settlement discussions related to the majority of the cases in which we are a defendant. We do not expect our share of liability, if any, for the remaining cases to significantly impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We voluntarily discontinued producing MTBE in 2002.      Natural Gas Royalty Litigation     We are currently a party to one qui tam case, which alleges that Marathon and other defendants violated the False Claims Act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids for federal and Indian leases. A qui tam action is an action in which the relator files suit on behalf of himself as well as the federal government. The case currently pending is U.S. ex rel Harrold E. Wright v. Agip Petroleum Co. et al. It is primarily a gas valuation case. Marathon has reached a settlement with the Relator and the DOJ which will be finalized after the Indian Tribes review and approve the settlement terms. Such settlement is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     Product Contamination Litigation      A lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia alleged that our Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery distributed contaminated gasoline to wholesalers and retailers for a period prior to August 2003, causing permanent damage to storage tanks, dispensers and related equipment, resulting in lost profits, business disruption and personal and real property damages. Following the incident, we conducted remediation operations at affected facilities and there was no permanent damage to wholesaler and retailer equipment. Class action certification was granted in August 2007. A settlement of the case was approved by the court on March 18, 2009, payment has been made and the case has been dismissed with prejudice. The settlement did not significantly impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     Item 1A. Risk Factors     We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. See the discussion of such risks and uncertainties under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in that Form 10-K.         39     Index   Item 2.
