Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us.44Capital ResourcesCredit Arrangements and BorrowingsAt September 30, 2017, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2017, we had $6.5 billion in long-term debt outstanding, with our next debt maturity in the amount of $600 million due in 2020. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Asset DisposalIn the second quarter of 2017, we closed on the sale of our Canadian business for $2.5 billion, excluding closing adjustments. Under the terms of the agreement, $1.8 billion was paid to us upon closing and the remaining proceeds of $750 million will be paid to us in the first quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2017, we entered into agreements to sell certain non-core properties in our International E&P segment for combined proceeds of $53 million, before closing adjustments. Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital RatioOur cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash and cash equivalents to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash and cash equivalents) was 28% at September 30, 2017, compared to 21% at December 31, 2016.

As of September 30, 2017, we plan to make contributions of up to $8 million to our funded pension plans during the remainder of 2017. Contractual Cash ObligationsAs of September 30, 2017, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for cash obligations primarily relating to the sale of our Canadian business and the issuance of $1 billion of 4.4% senior unsecured notes due in 2027 and redemption of approximately $1.8 billion of debt due in 2017, 2018 and 2019. See Note 6 and Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As a result, as of September 30, 2017, our consolidated contractual cash obligations from our continuing operations has decreased by $1,392 million from December 31, 2016. Our short and long term debt (including 45interest) decreased $633 million, purchase obligations under oil and gas activities decreased by $54 million, and service and materials contracts decreased $642 million when comparing September 30, 2017 to December 31, 2016.Environmental Matters and Other ContingenciesIn July 2015, we received a request for information from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act regarding several tank batteries used in our Bakken operations. We executed a settlement agreement with the North Dakota Department of Health relating to this matter in the fourth quarter of 2016 that includes a base penalty of $294,000, which was reduced to $130,500 under the terms of the settlement agreement by mitigating corrective actions. We paid the penalty in September 2017 and do not believe that any penalties or corrective action expenditures that may result from this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows. See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies.Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation statements regarding our future performance, business strategy, reserve estimates, asset quality, production guidance, drilling plans, capital plans, cost and expense estimates, asset acquisitions and dispositions, future financial position, future payments for our Canadian disposition and other plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements.

While we believe our assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, a number of factors could cause results to differ materially from those projected, including, but not limited to: •conditions in the oil and gas industry, including supply and demand levels for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas and the resulting impact on price;•changes in expected reserve or production levels; •changes in political and economic conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, and global and domestic market conditions; •risks related to our hedging activities;•capital available for exploration and development; •the inability of any party to satisfy closing conditions with respect to our Canadian disposition;•drilling and operating risks;•well production timing; •availability of drilling rigs, materials and labor, including the costs associated therewith; •difficulty in obtaining necessary approvals and permits; •non-performance by third parties of contractual obligations; •unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto;•cyber-attacks;•changes in safety, health, environmental, tax and other regulations; •other geological, operating and economic considerations; and•the risk factors, forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.

Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this Report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2017. During the first nine months of 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.48Part II – OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal Proceedings We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims.

See Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item I for a description of such legal and administrative proceedings.The following is a summary of certain proceedings involving us that were pending or contemplated as of September 30, 2017, under federal, state and international environmental laws:In July 2015, we received a request for information from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act regarding several tank batteries used in our Bakken operations. We executed a settlement agreement with the North Dakota Department of Health relating to this matter in the fourth quarter of 2016 that includes a base penalty of $294,000, which was reduced to $130,500 under the terms of the settlement agreement by mitigating corrective actions. We paid the penalty in September 2017 and do not believe that any penalties or corrective action expenditures that may result from this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows.
