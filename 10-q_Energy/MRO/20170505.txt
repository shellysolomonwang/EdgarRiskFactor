Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us.Capital ResourcesCredit Arrangements and BorrowingsAt March 31, 2017, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility. At March 31, 2017, we had $7.3 billion in long-term debt outstanding. Our next debt maturity in the amount of $682 million is due in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $854 million is due in the first quarter of 2018. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Pending Asset Disposal In March 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell our Canadian business for $2.5 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, $1.75 billion, subject to closing adjustments, will be paid to us upon closing and the remaining proceeds will be paid in the first quarter of 2018. The sale is expected to close in mid-2017 concurrent with a related transaction between Shell and Canadian Natural Resources. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Pending Asset AcquisitionsIn March 2017, we entered into separate agreements to acquire approximately 91,000 net acres in the Permian basin, including over 70,000 net acres in the Northern Delaware basin of New Mexico for $1.8 billion, excluding closing adjustments. We paid $180 million in aggregate deposits into escrow related to these acquisitions during the first quarter of 2017. We closed on the acquisition from BC Operating, Inc. and other entities with cash on hand on May 1, 2017 and expect to close our remaining acquisition from Black Mountain Oil & Gas and other private sellers in the second quarter of 2017 with cash on hand. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.31Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital RatioOur cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash and cash equivalents to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash and cash equivalents) was 28% at March 31, 2017, compared to 21% at December 31, 2016.

As a result, we increased our approved Capital Program for 2017 from $2.2 billion to approximately $2.4 billion as a result of these acquisitions.Other Expected Cash OutflowsOn April 26, 2017, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.05 per share for the first quarter of 2017 payable June 12, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 17, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, we plan to make contributions of up to $47 million to our funded pension plans during the remainder of 2017. Contractual Cash ObligationsAs of March 31, 2017, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for the agreements we entered into to acquire Permian acreage for $1.8 billion, excluding closing adjustments. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Additionally, in March 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell our Canadian business for $2.5 billion. The sale is expected to close in mid-2017 concurrent with a related transaction between Shell and Canadian Natural Resources. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As a result, our Canadian business is reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. As of March 31, 2017, our consolidated contractual cash obligations from our continuing operations has decreased by $1,107 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to obligations relating to the announced sale of our Canadian business. Our purchase obligations under oil and gas activities decreased by $67 million, service and materials contracts decreased $628 million and transportation and related contracts decreased $281 million when comparing March 31, 2017 to December 31, 2016.Environmental Matters and Other ContingenciesIn July 2015, we received a request for information from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act regarding several tank batteries used in our Bakken operations. We executed a settlement agreement with the North Dakota Department of Health relating to this matter in the fourth quarter of 2016 that includes a base penalty of $294,000 that will be reduced under the terms by mitigating corrective actions. We do not believe that any penalties or corrective action expenditures that may result from this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows. In March 2016 we proactively notified the U.K. environmental regulator Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (“BEIS”) that we had recognized an error in our carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions reporting. In December 2016 we received a 32‘Notice of Intent to Impose a Civil Penalty’ from BEIS for the self-disclosed underreporting of CO2 emissions. The letter advised that the penalty for this event had initially been set at €946,360, however BEIS had reduced the amount to €630,906 in recognition of our self-reporting and proactive cooperation with the investigation. In February 2017 we received the final letter from BEIS, the ‘Civil Penalty Notice’ that confirmed the penalty. The fixed penalty is set by European Union legislation and is calculated in Euros. The payment is made to the U.K. regulator in GBP using conversion tables also defined by the European Union. The actual sum paid in April 2017 was £537,295.Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation statements regarding our future performance, business strategy, reserve estimates, asset quality, production guidance, drilling plans, capital plans, cost and expense estimates, asset acquisitions and dispositions, future financial position, and other plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements.

Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this Report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.35Part II – OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal Proceedings We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The following is a summary of certain proceedings involving us that were pending or contemplated as of March 31, 2017 under federal, state and international environmental laws:In July 2015, we received a request for information from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act regarding several tank batteries used in our Bakken operations.
