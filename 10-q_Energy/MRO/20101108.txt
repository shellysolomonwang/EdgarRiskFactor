Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the update to Item 1A. Risk Factors later in this Form 10-Q.   Activities related to discontinued operations in Gabon and Ireland have been excluded from segment results and operating statistics in comparative periods.       Overview and Outlook   Gulf of Mexico Drilling Moratorium      On April 22, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, a rig that was engaged in drilling operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, sank after an explosion and fire. The incident resulted in a significant oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. We have no ownership interest in those operations.   As a result of the Deepwater Horizon incident, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued a drilling moratorium, which was lifted on October 12, 2010, to suspend the drilling of wells using subsea blowout preventers or operations using a floating facility. As a result of the drilling moratorium, we suspended drilling an exploratory well on the Innsbruck prospect, located on Mississippi Canyon Block 993. Although the drilling moratorium has been lifted, it is not known when plans and permits will be approved for future deepwater drilling activity. The effects of new or additional laws or regulations that may be adopted in response to this incident are not fully known at this time and may impact future project execution.        Exploration and Production (“E&P”)   Exploration   Our 2010 exploration program is expected to exceed $1 billion and is focused on North America resource plays, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Indonesia, Norway and Libya. As stated above, in the Gulf of Mexico we suspended drilling on the Innsbruck prospect during the second quarter due to the drilling moratorium. The Noble Jim Day drilling rig has been contracted and is scheduled to become available in the fourth quarter of 2010, subject to regulatory uncertainties described above. Commissioning and testing of the rig has begun. It is our intent to reestablish our Gulf of Mexico exploration and development programs unless new laws, regulations or court orders prohibit these activities or make them not viable financially. The revised cost of the Innsbruck well is now estimated at $145 million. We are the operator and hold an 85 percent working interest in the prospect.     In December 2009, we began drilling an exploratory well on the Flying Dutchman prospect, located on Green Canyon Block 511 in the Gulf of Mexico. The Flying Dutchman reached its targeted total depth in early May 2010. The well encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands that require further technical evaluation. During the second quarter of 2010, we expensed approximately $51 million for drilling costs incurred below the depth of the hydrocarbon-bearing        22         sands and have approximately $95 million of exploratory well costs suspended as of September 30, 2010 . The results of the Flying Dutchman will continue to be evaluated along with additional potential drilling on Green Canyon Block 511 to determine overall commerciality. We are the operator and have a 63 percent working interest in this prospect.   During the second quarter 2010, we were awarded all five blocks bid in the Central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale No. 213 conducted by the U.S. Department of the Interior, for a total of $24 million. Four blocks are 100 percent Marathon, and the remaining block was bid with partners.   We acquired approximately 120,000 net acres within the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of southeast Wyoming and northern Colorado. We expect to commence drilling in 2011.   In the Oklahoma Woodford shale, we continue to expand our acreage position and now hold approximately 75,000 net acres within the play. We have existing production operations in this geographical area which will facilitate early drilling, with initial wells currently in progress.   In Indonesia, we began our deepwater exploration drilling program in the Pasangkayu block in August 2010 and are targeting the Bravo and Romeo prospects. The Bravo exploration well is expected to reach total depth in the fourth quarter while the Romeo exploration well is expected to reach total depth during the first half of 2011. We are the operator and hold a 70 percent working interest in the Pasangkayu block.   In October 2010, we announced the acquisition of a position in four exploration blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We have signed production sharing agreements for operatorship and an 80 percent ownership in two open blocks northeast of Erbil, Harir and Safen. The Kurdistan Regional Government will hold a 20 percent interest but bear no costs. We were assigned working interests in two additional blocks located north-northwest of Erbil, Atrush in which we have a 20 percent working interest and Sarsang in which we have a 25 percent working interest. The total entry cost, subject to final adjustments, is $156 million plus a pro rata share of historic exploration costs estimated to be $20 million. This transaction provides us with access to approximately 295,000 net acres. We have committed to a seismic program and to drilling one well on each of the two open blocks during the initial three-year exploration period. The Atrush and Sarsang blocks each have a well currently drilling.   In September 2010, we added an eleventh license with shale gas potential in Poland, increasing our total acreage position to approximately 2.3 million net acres. We have a 100 percent interest and operate all 11 blocks. We continue to pursue additional licenses and plan to begin geologic studies in Poland in 2010 followed by the acquisition of seismic in 2011 and plans to initiate drilling by the fourth quarter of 2011.   Production   Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales averaged 399 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”) during the third quarter and 382 mboepd during the first nine months of 2010 compared to 366 and 396 mboepd during the third quarter and first nine months of 2009. The increase in sales volumes in the third quarter of 2010 over the same period of the previous year is primarily related to Droshky development production beginning in this quarter and reliability at both our Alvheim development offshore Norway and the Alba field and related facilities in Equatorial Guinea. The 3 percent decrease for the nine-month period was primarily related to the sale of a portion of our Permian Basin assets in the second quarter of 2009, the planned turnaround in Equatorial Guinea in the first four months of 2010, maintenance downtime offshore U.K., and normal production declines.   Our Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Block 244 began production in mid-July of 2010 and reached peak net production of 45,000 boepd in the third quarter of 2010, down from the original estimate of 50,000 boepd. Production declines have been steeper than anticipated due to reservoir compartmentalization and lack of aquifer support. This subsea project consists of four development wells tied back to a third-party platform. Three of the four wells are currently producing, while production from the fourth well has been delayed due to an equipment issue. We plan to re-enter the fourth well in the first quarter of 2011 to make the necessary repairs. We hold a 100 percent operated working interest and an 81 percent net revenue interest in Droshky.   Our net liquid hydrocarbon sales in North Dakota from the Bakken Shale resource play have increased to 13 thousand barrels per day (“bpd”) in third quarter of 2010 compared to 11 mbpd in the same quarter of last year. We added a sixth operated rig during the third quarter of 2010.   In the second quarter of 2010, we commenced production at the Volund field offshore Norway which allows us to maintain full capacity on the Alvheim floating production, storage and offloading (“FPSO”) vessel. We hold a 65 percent operated interest in the Volund field.   In Libya, Phase II of the Faregh project began commissioning during the third quarter of 2010 and first production is expected in November 2010. We have continued our exploration program in Libya with six discoveries in 2010.   Divestitures     During the first quarter 2010, we closed the sale of a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola. We received net proceeds of $1.3 billion and        23          recorded a pretax gain on the sale in the amount of $811 million. We retained a 10 percent outside-operated interest in Block 32.     The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the timing and levels of future production, exploration budget, anticipated future exploratory and development drilling activity, the Droshky development, the possibility of a significant new resource base in the Iraqi Kurdistan region, Phase II of the Faregh project in Libya, and the drilling moratorium. While the drilling moratorium was lifted on October 12, 2010, we cannot predict when plans and permits will be approved for future deepwater drilling activities. Some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The exploration budget is based on current expectations, estimates and projections and is not a guarantee of future performance. The foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits.   Oil Sands Mining (“OSM”)   Our net synthetic crude oil sales were 31 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) in the third quarter and 25 mbpd in the first nine months of 2010 compared to 33 mbpd and 31 mbpd in same periods of 2009. Current year sales continue to reflect the impact of the planned turnaround at the Muskeg River mine and upgrader that began March 22, 2010 and halted production in April before a staged resumption of operations in May. Incurred in the first six months of 2010, our net share of total turnaround costs was $99 million.   In the third quarter of 2010, the AOSP Expansion 1 project began a phased start-up of the Jackpine Mine operations, which will add capacity of 100,000 gross bpd to the existing Muskeg River Mine capacity of 155,000 bpd. The expanded upgrader operations are on schedule for a phased start-up beginning in late 2010 and extending into early 2011. Expansion 1 includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the Jackpine mine, expansion of treatment facilities at the existing Muskeg River mine, expansion of the Scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure. We hold a 20 percent working interest in the AOSP.     The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the start of operations of AOSP Expansion 1. Factors that could affect the project are transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.   Integrated Gas (“IG”)   Our share of LNG sales worldwide totaled 7,142 metric tonnes per day (“mtpd”) for the third quarter of 2010 compared to 6,372 mtpd in the third quarter of 2009 and 6,502 mtpd in the first nine months of 2010 compared to 6,583 mtpd in the first nine months of 2009. These LNG sales volumes include both consolidated sales volumes and our share of the sales volumes of equity method investees. LNG sales from Alaska are conducted through a consolidated subsidiary. LNG and methanol sales from Equatorial Guinea are conducted through equity method investees.     Refining, Marketing and Transportation (“RM&T”)   Our total refinery throughputs were 21 percent higher in the third quarter and 15 percent higher in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same periods of 2009. Crude oil refined increased 24 percent in both periods primarily related to the startup of the Garyville, Louisiana, expansion, while other charge and blendstocks increased 6 percent and decreased 25 percent compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2009. Due to the significant turnaround activity in the first quarter of 2010, along with the expected reduction in external charge and blendstocks requirements due to the Garyville refinery expansion, we have reduced our purchased charge and blendstocks volume in the first nine months of 2010.     We completed turnarounds at our Garyville, Texas City, Texas, Catlettsburg, Kentucky, Robinson, Illinois and St. Paul Park, Minnesota, refineries in the first nine months of 2010. Such activity compares to turnarounds at our Canton, Ohio; Robinson, Catlettsburg and Garyville refineries in the first nine months of 2009.   The refinery units completed as part of the expansion at Garyville have now been fully integrated into the Garyville refinery and are operating as expected. The 180,000 bpd expansion establishes the Garyville facility as the fourth-largest U.S. refinery with a rated crude oil capacity of 436,000 bpd.    Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline increased to an average of 72 mbpd for the third quarter and 67 mbpd in the first nine months of 2010 compared to 62 mbpd and 59 mbpd in the same periods of 2009. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of ethanol supply and government regulations.          24           Third quarter 2010 Speedway SuperAmerica LLC (“SSA”) same store gasoline sales volume increased 6 percent when compared to the third quarter of 2009, while same store merchandise sales increased by 3 percent for the same period. During the first quarter of 2010, Speedway was ranked the nation’s top retail gasoline brand for the second consecutive year, according to the 2010 EquiTrend® Brand Study conducted by Harris Interactive®.     As of September 30, 2010, the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan, refinery was approximately 47 percent complete and on schedule for an expected completion in the second half of 2012.   In October 2010, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our St. Paul Park, Minnesota, refinery (including associated terminal, tankage and pipeline investments) and 166 Speedway SuperAmerica retail outlets, plus related inventories. The fair value of the consideration is estimated to be approximately $900 million, which includes the estimated value of inventory and the fair values of (1) a retained preferred stock interest in the buyer with a stated value of $80 million, (2) a maximum $125 million earnout provision payable to us over eight years, and (3) a maximum $60 million of margin support payable to the buyer over two years. Cash proceeds at closing are estimated to be $700 million. The earnout and margin support provisions in the agreements are subject to certain conditions and any margin support paid may be recovered by an increase in the total earnout amount. We expect the sale transaction to close by yearend 2010, contingent upon the buyer meeting the conditions of their financing arrangements and other customary closing conditions.   The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the Detroit refinery project and the sale of the Minnesota assets. Factors that could affect the Detroit refinery project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Some factors that could potentially affect the sale of Minnesota assets include buyer financing and customary closing conditions, including government and regulatory approvals. These factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.    Market Conditions   Exploration and Production   Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices have been volatile in recent years, but both West Texas Intermediate crude oil and Dated Brent crude oil monthly average prices have been in the $75 to $85 per barrel range during 2010. The following table lists benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, when compared to the same periods in 2009.           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      Benchmark     2010       2009       2010       2009      West Texas Intermediate ("WTI")                                      crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 76.21     $ 68.24     $ 77.69     $ 57.32     Dated Brent crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 76.86     $ 68.08     $ 77.14     $ 57.32     Henry Hub natural gas (Dollars per mmbtu)(a)    $ 4.38     $ 3.39     $ 4.59     $ 3.93         (a)   First-of-month price index per million British thermal units.        Our domestic crude oil production is 60 to 70 percent sour, which means that it contains more sulfur than light sweet WTI does. Sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of its higher refining costs and lower refined product values. Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the Dated Brent crude oil benchmark.     A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Our other major natural gas-producing region is Equatorial Guinea, where large portions of our natural gas sales is subject to term contracts, making realized prices in this area less volatile. As we sell larger quantities of natural gas from these regions, since these fixed prices are generally lower than prevailing prices, our reported average natural gas prices realizations may not track market price movements.     Oil Sands Mining   OSM segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce. Roughly two-thirds of our normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil market, primarily Western Canadian Select. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader. See Note 12 for the commodity derivatives contracts related to 2010 forecasted sales.          25           The operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per unit costs are sensitive to production rate. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian AECO natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively.   The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 and 2009:           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      Benchmark     2010       2009       2010       2009      WTI crude oil (Dollars per barrel)    $ 76.21     $ 68.24     $ 77.69     $ 57.32     Western Canadian Select (Dollars per barrel)(a)    $ 60.55     $ 58.12     $ 64.72     $ 48.15     AECO natural gas sales                                      index (Canadian dollars per gigajoule)(b)      3.36       2.78       3.93       3.59         (a)    Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada.        (b)    Monthly average of Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) day ahead index.        Integrated Gas   Our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, primarily in the U.S., Europe and West Africa.   Our most significant LNG investment is our 60 percent ownership in a production facility in Equatorial Guinea, which sells LNG under a long-term contract at prices tied to Henry Hub natural gas prices. In general, LNG delivered to the U.S. is tied to Henry Hub prices and will track with changes in U.S. natural gas prices, while LNG sold in Europe and Asia is indexed to crude oil prices and will track the movement of those prices.   We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Equatorial Guinea through our investment in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”). Methanol demand has a direct impact on AMPCO’s earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. AMPCO’s plant capacity is 1.1 million tonnes, or 3 percent of estimated 2009 world demand.     Refining, Marketing and Transportation   RM&T segment income depends largely on our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, refinery throughputs and retail marketing gross margins for gasoline, distillates and merchandise.   Our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast crack spreads that we feel most closely track our operations and slate of products. Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of crude oil refined into 3 barrels of gasoline, 2 barrels of distillate and 1 barrel of residual fuel) are used for the crack spread calculation.   Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly causing our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin to differ from the crack spreads which are based upon sweet crude. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin.   In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads and sweet/sour differential, our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:       ·    the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed,          ·    the selling prices realized for refined products,          ·    the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to manage price risk,          ·    the cost of products purchased for resale, and          ·    changes in manufacturing costs, which include depreciation, energy used by our refineries and the level of maintenance costs.             26           The following table lists calculated average crack spreads for the Midwest and Gulf Coast markets and the sweet/sour differential for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 and 2009:           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      (Dollars per barrel)     2010       2009       2010       2009      Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread    $ 3.68     $ 3.93     $ 3.40     $ 4.20     U.S. Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread    $ 1.70     $ 2.50     $ 2.49     $ 2.99     Sweet/Sour differential(a)    $ 8.08     $ 5.64     $ 7.39     $ 5.62         (a)   Calculated using the following mix of crude types: 15% Arab Light, 20% Kuwait, 10% Maya, 15% Western Canadian Select and 40% Mars compared to LLS.      Even though the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread was lower in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009, our realized margin for the period improved from processing sour crude, due to the widening of the sweet/sour differential. The benchmark sweet/sour differential widened 43 percent in the third quarter and 31 percent in the first nine months of 2010 relative to the same periods of last year. Due to the Garyville refinery expansion we were able to process a higher volume of sour crude oil during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2010. Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 51 percent of the 1,263 mbpd of crude oil processed in the third quarter of 2010 and 53 percent of the 1,166 mbpd of crude oil processed in the first nine months of 2010 compared to 49 percent of the 1,019 mbpd of crude processed in the third quarter and 52 percent of the 943 mbpd of crude processed in the first nine months in 2009.   Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the difference between the ultimate price paid by consumers and the cost of refined products, including secondary transportation and consumer excise taxes, also impacts RM&T segment profitability. There are numerous factors including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions that impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year. The gross margin on merchandise sold at retail outlets has been historically less volatile.     Results of Operations   Consolidated Results of Operation   Consolidated net income for 2010 was 69 percent higher in third quarter and 68 percent higher in the first nine months than in the same periods of 2009. Higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations and sales volumes in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009 increased E&P segment income, while RM&T segment income was increased as a result of improved refining and marketing gross margins combined with higher increased throughput. The income increase in the first nine months of 2010 was primarily related to higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations.         Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table:                                     Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      (In millions)     2010       2009       2010       2009      E&P    $ 2,532     $ 1,979     $ 7,683     $ 5,386     OSM      190       167       534       444     IG      38       15       98       33     RM&T      15,897       12,407       45,054       32,148                                         Segment revenues      18,657       14,568       53,369       38,011     Elimination of intersegment revenues      (214 )     (193 )     (608 )     (506 )   Gain (Loss) on U.K. natural gas contracts      -       (13 )     -       72      Total revenues    $ 18,443     $ 14,362     $ 52,761     $ 37,577                                        Items included in both revenues and costs:                                     Consumer excise taxes on petroleum products                                     and merchandise    $ 1,351     $ 1,258     $ 3,871     $ 3,658         E&P segment revenues increased $553 million in the third quarter and $2,297 million in the first nine months of 2010 from the comparable prior-year periods. The increases were primarily a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas price realizations. Liquid hydrocarbon realizations averaged $72.95 per barrel in the third quarter and        27         $73.64 in the first nine months of 2010 compared to $64.12 and $53.62 in the same periods of 2009, while natural gas realizations averaged $2.69 per mcf in the third quarter and $2.86 in the first nine months of 2010 compared to $2.20 and $2.42 in the same periods of 2009.   Revenues in both 2010 periods include the impact of derivative instruments intended to mitigate price risk on future sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. A net pretax gain of $13 million was reported by the E&P segment in the third quarter of 2010, while there was a net pretax gain of $91 million in the first nine months of 2010.   For the third quarter and the first nine months of 2009, losses of $13 million and gains of $72 million related to natural gas sales contracts in the U.K. that were accounted for as derivative instruments were excluded for E&P segment revenues. Those contracts expired in the third quarter of 2009.   Net sales volumes from continuing operations during the quarter were 399 mboepd in 2010 and 366 mboepd in 2009. Net sales volumes for the first nine months of 2010 were 3 percent lower than the comparable prior-year period, primarily impacted by the sale of a portion of our Permian Basin assets in the second quarter of 2009, the planned turnaround in Equatorial Guinea during the first four months of 2010, maintenance downtime offshore U.K., and normal production declines. This decrease in sales volumes partially offsets the impact of the liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas realization increases previously discussed.          28          The following tables report E&P segment realizations and sales volumes in greater detail for all periods.

The 2009 values have been recast to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations.        (b)   Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 15 mmcfd and 18 mmcfd for the third quarters of 2010 and 2009, and 19 mmcfd and 20 mmcfd for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009.        (c)   Excludes gains and losses on derivative instruments and the unrealized effects of U.K. natural gas contracts that were accounted for as derivatives in 2009.           29          OSM segment revenues increased $23 million in the third quarter and $90 million in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same periods of 2009. Revenues in both periods include the impact of derivative instruments intended to mitigate price risk relative to future sales of synthetic crude. Derivative losses of $8 million and gains of $34 million were included in segment revenues for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, while gains of $3 million and $10 million were included in segment revenues for the same periods of 2009.   Excluding the derivative effects, segment revenues increased in both periods of 2010, primarily due to higher synthetic crude realizations. Net synthetic crude sales for the third quarter of 2010 were 31 mbpd at an average realized price of $67.83 per barrel compared to 33 mbpd at $62.08 in the same period last year. For the nine-month period net synthetic crude sales were 25 mbpd at $69.07 in 2010 compared to 31 mbpd at $52.02 in 2009.   See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative instruments.   RM&T segment revenues increased $3,490 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $12,906 million in the first nine months of 2010 from the comparable periods of 2009. Our refined product and liquid hydrocarbon selling prices were higher and accounted for 39 percent of the third quarter and 66 percent of the first nine months of 2010 revenue increase. Benchmark refined product price changes are illustrated in the following table. Refined product sales volumes increased 20 percent in the third quarter and 15 percent in the first nine months of 2010, primarily related to higher production from our expanded Garyville refinery.           Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      (Dollars per gallon)     2010       2009       2010       2009      Chicago Spot Unleaded regular gasoline    $ 2.02     $ 1.84     $ 2.05     $ 1.61     Chicago Spot Ultra-low sulfur diesel      2.12       1.80       2.11       1.56     USGC Spot Unleaded regular gasoline      1.95       1.77       2.02       1.55     USGC Spot Ultra-low sulfur diesel    $ 2.09     $ 1.79     $ 2.10     $ 1.57       Income from equity method investments increased $20 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $117 million in the first nine months of 2010 from the comparable prior-year periods. Higher commodity prices in 2010 compared to 2009 positively impacted the earnings of many of our equity method investees. In the third quarter of 2010, we fully impaired our Integrated Gas segment’s equity method investment in an entity engaged in gas-to-fuels related technology, see Note 11.   Net gain on disposal of assets in the first nine months of 2010 primarily represents the sale of a 20 percent outside-operated undivided interest in our Production Sharing and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola. During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded a gain of $811 million on the sale. The net gain on disposal of assets in the first nine months of 2009 primarily represents the sale of a portion of our operated and all of our outside-operated Permian Basin producing assets in New Mexico and west Texas.   Cost of revenues increased $3,328 million and $13,384 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 from the comparable periods of 2009. In both periods, the increase was primarily the result of higher acquisition prices for crude oil, charge and blendstocks and purchased refined products in the RM&T segment. Increased volumes of purchased crude oil also contributed to the increased costs.   Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 from the comparable prior-year periods. The DD&A increase for the quarter was related to the higher sales volumes at a higher rate of DD&A per barrel on our domestic E&P assets and the Garyville expansion being put into service at the end of 2009. Current quarter DD&A for our domestic E&P assets increased $72 million from the same quarter of last year, primarily as a result of new production from Droshky, which began mid-July and ratably increased to peak production in September of 45,000 boepd. For the nine-month period, the increase primarily related to Garyville.   Long-lived asset impairments in the first nine months of 2010 include a $28 million impairment of our maleic anhydride plant and a $423 million impairment of our Powder River Basin field. See Note 11 for information about these impairments.   Exploration expenses were $59 million in the third quarter of 2010, with no expenses related to dry wells and $282 million and first nine months of 2010, including expenses related to dry wells of $89 million. The majority of dry well costs in 2010 relate to the partial writeoff of the previously discussed offshore Gulf of Mexico well on the Flying Dutchman prospect. Exploration expenses were $55 million and $181 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009, including expenses related to dry wells of $10 million and $22 million.     Provision for income taxes increased $193 million and $499 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 from the comparable periods of 2009 primarily due to the increase in pretax income. The effective tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographical and functional sources of income, the relative magnitude of        30         these sources of income, and foreign currency remeasurement effects. The effective income tax rate decreased primarily due to these factors, partially offset by an increase from legislation changes, see Note 8.   The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009:           Nine Months Ended September 30,          2010       2009      Statutory U.S. income tax rate      35  %     35  %   Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits      17       25     State and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effects      -       1     Legislation change      1       -     Other      (1 )     -      Effective income tax rate      52  %     61  %     The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in corporate and other unallocated items.     Discontinued operations reflect the 2009 disposal of our E&P businesses in Ireland and Gabon (see Note 5) and the historical results of those operations, net of tax, for all periods presented.       Segment Results                                               Segment income (loss) is summarized in the following table:                                     Three Months Ended September 30,       Nine Months Ended September 30,      (In millions)     2010       2009       2010       2009      E&P                             United States    $ 99     $ 32     $ 233     $ (61 )    International      411       459       1,211       843      E&P segment      510       491       1,444       782                                        OSM      18       25       (59 )     3     IG      41       13       109       53     RM&T      285       158       469       482                                         Segment income      854       687       1,963       1,320     Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes:                                     Corporate and other unallocated items      (106 )     (159 )     (178 )     (299 )    Foreign currency remeasurement of income taxes      (37 )     (114 )     33       (180 )    Gain (loss) on dispositions      -       (15 )     449       107      Impairments      (15 )     -       (303 )     -      Loss on early extinguishment of debt      -       -       (57 )     -      Deferred income taxes - tax legislation changes      -       -       (45 )     -      Gain on U.K. natural gas contracts      -       (7 )     -       37      Discontinued operations      -       21       -       123     Net income    $ 696     $ 413     $ 1,862     $ 1,108         United States E&P income increased $67 million and $294 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 compared to the same periods of 2009. The income increase in the third quarter of 2010 was primarily the result of higher liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas realization, and sales volume increases, as previously discussed, offset by increased DD&A. For the nine-month period, the income increase was primarily the result of higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations and derivative gains, partially offset by increased exploration expenses.     International E&P income decreased $48 million in the third quarter of 2010 and increased $368 million in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same periods of 2009. The income decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to income taxes. During the third quarter of 2009, we began to credit certain foreign taxes that were previously        31         deducted resulting in a lower effective tax rate in the prior year. The income increase in the first nine months was primarily due to revenue increases as previously discussed. Liquid hydrocarbon realizations increased 14 percent and 37 percent for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 compared to the same periods of 2009.   OSM segment income decreased $7 million and $62 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010. The decline in third quarter income was primarily due to an after-tax derivative loss of $6 million. The decreased income in the first nine months was primarily due to lower sales volumes and higher incremental cost both primarily resulting from the previously discussed turnaround. An after-tax derivative gain of $26 million and synthetic crude realization improvements of 33 percent partially offset the impact of the turnaround on segment income.   IG segment income increased $28 million and $56 million in the third quarter of 2010 and first nine months of 2010 compared to the same periods of 2009. The increase was primarily the result of higher price realizations in both periods of 2010 compared to 2009.   RM&T segment income increased by $127 million in the third quarter but decreased $13 million in first nine months of 2010 compared to the same periods of 2009. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to a higher refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, which averaged 9.21 cents per gallon in the third quarter of 2010 compared to 7.62 cents per gallon in the same quarter of 2009. A wider sweet/sour crude differential coupled with an increase in sour crude throughput contributed to the increase in segment income. These favorable impacts were partially offset by increased manufacturing expenses in the third quarter 2010 compared to the third quarter 2009 due to a combination of increased depreciation and energy expense associated with the additional Garyville refinery units.   The decrease in segment income in the nine month period was primarily due to a lower refining and wholesale marketing gross margin, which averaged 6.36 cents per gallon in the first nine months of 2010 compared to 8.08 cents per gallon in the comparable period of 2009. Higher sales volumes resulting from the Garyville expansion helped to mitigate the effects of the lower gross margin per gallon. Also impacting the gross margin were higher manufacturing costs relating to a pretax increase of approximately $170 million in refining system turnaround and maintenance costs plus higher depreciation and energy expenses related to the Garyville expansion units.    Our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin also included pretax derivative losses of $20 million and gains of $30 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 compared to losses of $17 million and $64 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2009.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows and Liquidity     Cash Flows   Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2,988 million in the first nine months of 2010, compared to $3,309 million in the first nine months of 2009.   Net cash used in investing activities totaled $2,256 million in the first nine months of 2010, compared to $4,166 million in the first nine months of 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, we closed the sale of our 20 percent outside-operated undivided interest in the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola. The related cash inflow was $1.3 billion.   In our E&P segment, exploration and development projects in 2010 are offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, on our Angola development, Norway developments, and U.S. unconventional resource plays. With the completion of our Garyville refinery expansion at the end of 2009, we have reduced spending in our RM&T segment while keeping the expansion and upgrading of our Detroit, Michigan, refinery on track. The AOSP Expansion 1 in our OSM segment continues into 2010, with the spending rate relatively unchanged from 2009 levels.    For further information regarding capital expenditures by segment, see Supplemental Statistics.   Net cash used in financing activities was $1,146 million in the first nine months of 2010, compared to net cash provided of $926 million in the first nine months of 2009. Significant uses of cash in the first nine months of 2010 included the repayment of $500 million aggregate principal value of debt at a weighted average price of 117 percent of face value under two tender offers in the second quarter of 2010 and dividends. Sources of cash in the first nine months of 2009 included the issuance of $1.5 billion in senior notes, with the only significant use of cash being dividends.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations and our $3 billion committed revolving credit facility. Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, share repurchase program, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.       32          Capital Resources   At September 30, 2010, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility.   During the third quarter of 2010, we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell various types of debt and equity securities.   Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 21 percent at September 30, 2010, compared to 23 percent at December 31, 2009. This includes $235 million of debt that is serviced by United States Steel Corporation (“United States Steel”).

In April 2010, the dividend was increased from 24 cents per share to 25 cents per share, a 4 percent increase in our quarterly dividend.   Since January 2006, our Board of Directors has authorized a common share repurchase program totaling $5 billion. As of September 30, 2010, we had repurchased 66 million common shares at a cost of $2,922 million. We have not made any purchases under the program since August 2008. Purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. The program’s authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables. The timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales, cash from available borrowings and market conditions.     Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The forward-looking statements about our common stock repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas        33           and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production, refining and mining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.     Contractual Cash Obligations     The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of September 30, 2010:                  2011-       2013-      Later      (In millions)     Total       2010        2012       2014      Years      Long-term debt (excludes interest)(a)    $ 7,573     $ 34     $ 1,553     $ 984     $ 5,002     Sale-leaseback financing(a)      23       1       22       -       -     Capital lease obligations(a)      641       6       81       88       466     Operating lease obligations(a)      1,022       39       306       276       401     Operating lease obligations under sublease(a)      12       -       12       -       -     Purchase obligations:                                            Crude oil, feedstock, refined product      10,937       8,959       1,363       445       170      and ethanol contracts                                            Transportation and related contracts      2,002       120       503       265       1,114     Contracts to acquire property, plant and      2,843       782       1,440       575       46      equipment                                            LNG terminal operating costs(b)      133       3       25       25       79     Service and materials contracts(c)      1,944       131       507       352       953     Unconditional purchase obligations(d)      47       8       16       16       8     Commitments for oil and gas exploration      23       12       5       1       6      (non-capital)(e)                                            Total purchase obligations      17,929       10,015       3,859       1,679       2,376     Other long-term liabilities reported                                             in the consolidated balance sheet(f)      2,300       82       643       560       1,015     Total contractual cash obligations(g)    $ 29,500     $ 10,177     $ 6,476     $ 3,587     $ 9,260           (a)   Includes debt and lease obligations assumed by United States Steel upon the USX Separation.          (b)   We have acquired the right to deliver 58 bcf of natural gas per year to the Elba Island LNG re-gasification terminal. The agreement’s primary term ends in 2021. Pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the terminal.          (c)   Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.          (d)   We are a part to a long-term transportation services agreement with Alliance Pipeline. This agreement was used by Alliance Pipeline to secure its financing.          (e)   Commitments on oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs.          (f)   Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2019. Also includes amounts for uncertain tax positions.          (g)   This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties.          Receivable from United States Steel   We remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for $249 million of certain debt and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment (see the USX Separation in Item 1. of our 2009 Annual Report on 10-K). United States Steel reported in its Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2010 that it believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future.        34            Environmental Matters     We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil, refined products and feedstocks.     We have finalized our strategic approach to comply with Mobile Source Air Toxics II (“MSAT II”) regulations relating to benzene content in refined products and updated the project cost estimates to comply with these requirements. We now estimate that we may spend approximately $650 million over a four-year period that began in 2008, reduced from our previous projection of approximately $1 billion over a six-year period. The overall cost reduction for MSAT II compliance is a result of lower costs for several projects along with our finalization of the most appropriate MSAT II compliance approach for our refineries. Our actual MSAT II expenditures since inception have totaled $462 million through September 30, 2010, with $61 million in the third quarter of 2010. We expect total year 2010 spending will be approximately $275 million. The cost estimates are forward-looking statements and are subject to change as further work is completed in 2010.     In October 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a partial waiver decision under the Clean Air Act to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10 percent (E10) to 15 percent (E15) for 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. There are numerous state and federal regulatory issues that would need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed for use in any traditional gasoline engines.     There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2009.       Other Contingencies     We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to us. However, we believe that we will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to us. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.     Critical Accounting Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.     Certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.     There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates subsequent to December 31, 2009.          35          Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     In October 2010, we initiated a crack spread derivative strategy related to a portion of our St. Paul Park refinery's projected production. This strategy is designed to mitigate potential commodity price fluctuation risks, and is associated with the expected sale by yearend of the St. Paul Park refinery and its related assets. Upon closing of the sale, derivative instruments executed pursuant to this strategy, along with all corresponding rights and obligations, will transfer to the buyer. As of October 31, 2010, we held derivative instruments covering 22 million barrels under this strategy. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the pending sale.     Disclosures about how derivatives are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how the fair values of our derivative instruments are measured may be found in Note 11 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements.     Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices on our open commodity derivative instruments as of September 30, 2010 is provided in the following table.

Controls and Procedures     An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.          36           MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited)           Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended          September 30,       September 30,      (In millions)     2010       2009       2010       2009                                         Segment Income (Loss)                                     Exploration and Production                                     United States    $ 99     $ 32     $ 233     $ (61 )    International      411       459       1,211       843      E&P segment      510       491       1,444       782      Oil Sands Mining      18       25       (59 )     3      Integrated Gas      41       13       109       53      Refining, Marketing and Transportation      285       158       469       482      Segment income      854       687       1,963       1,320                                         Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes      (158 )     (274 )     (101 )     (212 )    Net income    $ 696     $ 413     $ 1,862     $ 1,108     Capital Expenditures(a)                                     Exploration and Production                                     United States    $ 352     $ 403     $ 1,222     $ 1,018      International      234       113       552       472      E&P segment      586       516       1,774       1,490      Oil Sands Mining      191       267       699       834      Integrated Gas       1       -       2       1      Refining, Marketing and Transportation      273       634       839       2,007      Discontinued Operations(b)      -       3       -       66      Corporate      13       10       27       18      Total    $ 1,064     $ 1,430     $ 3,341     $ 4,416     Exploration Expenses                                     United States    $ 34     $ 23     $ 192     $ 88      International      25       32       90       93      Total    $ 59     $ 55     $ 282     $ 181                                              (a)   Capital expenditures include changes in accruals.

Legal Proceedings   We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Certain of these matters are included below. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. However, we believe that we will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably.     MTBE Litigation   We are a defendant, along with other refining companies, in six cases arising in five states alleging damages for MTBE contamination. We do not expect these cases to significantly impact our consolidated results of operations, financial positions, or cash flows. We expect additional lawsuits alleging such damages against us in the future, but likewise do not expect them to significantly impact our consolidated results of operations, financial positions, or cash flows.     Natural Gas Royalty Litigation   We have settled a qui tam case which alleged that Marathon and other defendants violated the False Claims Act with respect to the reporting and payment of royalties on natural gas and natural gas liquids for federal and Indian leases. A qui tam action is an action in which the Relator files suit on behalf of himself as well as the federal government. The case was U.S. ex rel Harrold E. Wright v. Agip Petroleum Co. et al. It was primarily a gas valuation case. We finalized and funded the settlement with all parties who include the Relator, the Department of Justice and the Indian Tribes. Such settlement did not significantly impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     Environmental Proceedings   During 2001, we entered into a New Source Review consent decree and settlement of alleged Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and other violations with the U.S. EPA covering all of our refineries. The settlement committed us to specific control technologies and implementation schedules for environmental expenditures and improvements to our refineries over approximately an eight-year period, which are now substantially complete. As part of this consent decree, we were required to conduct evaluations of refinery benzene waste air pollution programs (benzene waste “NESHAPS”). Pursuant to a modification to our New Source Review consent decree, we have agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. EPA to pay a civil penalty of $408,000 and conduct supplemental environmental projects of approximately $1 million, as part of a settlement of an enforcement action for alleged CAA violations relating to benzene waste NESHAPS. A modification to our New Source Review consent decree was finalized June 30, 2010 and the civil penalty amount has been paid.   The U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty, and Proposed Compliance Order to Marathon Pipe Line LLC (“MPL”) related to the March 10, 2009 incident at St. James, Louisiana. PHMSA has proposed a civil penalty in the amount of approximately $1 million. On September 22, 2010, PHMSA granted MPL a 60-day extension in which to respond to the Notice of Probable Violation. Our response is due by November 26, 2010.   Item 1A. Risk Factors   We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following are updates to our risk factors.     Our offshore operations involve special risks that could negatively impact us.   Offshore exploration and development operations present technological challenges and operating risks because of the marine environment. Activities in deepwater areas may pose incrementally greater risks because of water depths that limit intervention capability and the physical distance to oilfield service infrastructure and service providers. Environmental remediation and other costs resulting from spills or releases may result in substantial liabilities and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and market value of our securities.        40            Restrictions on U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater operations and similar action by countries where we do business could have a significant impact on our operations.   As a result of the Deepwater Horizon incident, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued a drilling moratorium to suspend outer continental shelf subsea and floating facility operations. Due to this drilling moratorium, we suspended drilling activity on one well in the Gulf of Mexico. While this moratorium was lifted on October 12, 2010, we cannot predict when necessary plans and permits will be approved for renewed offshore drilling activity. An extended regulatory delay on deepwater drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico or changes in laws or regulations affecting our operations in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and market value of our securities. In addition, other countries where we do business may make changes to their laws or regulations governing offshore operations, including deepwater areas that could have a similar material adverse effect.   We will continue to incur substantial capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of compliance with, and changes in environmental health, safety and security laws and regulations, and, as a result, our profitability could be materially reduced.   We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent, causes of and responsibility for climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. As an update to legislation and regulatory activity that impacts or could impact our operations:       ·    The U.S. EPA issued a finding in 2009 that greenhouse gases contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. Related to this endangerment finding, in April of 2010, the EPA finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources (cars and light duty vehicles). The endangerment finding along with the mobile source standard and EPA’s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, will lead to widespread regulation of stationary sources of greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the EPA has issued a so-called tailoring rule to limit the applicability of the EPA’s major permitting programs to larger sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as our refineries and a few large production facilities. Although legal challenges have been filed or are expected to be filed against these EPA actions, no court decisions are expected for about two years.           ·    Congress may continue to consider legislation in 2010 on greenhouse gas emissions, which may include a cap and trade system for stationary sources and a carbon fee on transportation fuels.      Although there may be adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and potential reduced demand for crude oil or certain refined products) associated with any legislation, regulation or other action, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the fact that requirements have only recently been adopted and the present uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented.        41           Item 2.
