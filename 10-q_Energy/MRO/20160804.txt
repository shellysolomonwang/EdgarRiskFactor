Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us.The June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (“Brexit”) provided uncertainty and potential volatility around European currencies, and resulted in a decline in the value of the British pound, as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. Volatility in exchange rates may continue in the short term as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the European Union. A weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. For our U.K. operations a majority of our revenues are tied to global crude oil prices which are denominated in U.S. dollars while a significant portion of our operating and capital costs are denominated in British pounds. In addition, our U.K. operations have an asset retirement obligation, which represents a future cash commitment. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations.Capital ResourcesCredit Arrangements and BorrowingsAt June 30, 2016, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility. At June 30, 2016, we had $7.3 billion in long-term debt outstanding, with our next debt maturity in the amount of $682 million due in the fourth quarter of 2017. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of equity and debt securities. Asset Disposals During the quarter, we announced the sale of our Wyoming upstream and midstream assets for proceeds of $870 million, before closing adjustments, of which approximately $690 million was received in the second quarter. The remaining asset sales are subject to the receipt of certain tribal consents and are expected to close before year end. The proceeds for the remaining asset sales were deposited into an escrow account by the buyer.In March and April 2016, we entered into separate agreements to sell our 10% working interest in the outside-operated Shenandoah discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, operated natural gas assets in the Piceance basin in Colorado and certain undeveloped acreage in West Texas for a combined total of approximately $80 million in proceeds, before closing adjustments. We closed on certain of the asset sales during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The remaining asset sales are expected to close by year-end.34Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital Ratio Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash and cash equivalents to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash and cash equivalents) was 20% at June 30, 2016, compared to 25% at December 31, 2015.

We expect our Capital Program for full-year 2016 to be $1.3 billion, or $100 million lower than the original budget, which includes the increased activity from the PayRock acquisition. On July 27, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.05 per share for the second quarter of 2016 payable September 12, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 17, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, we plan to make contributions of up to $34 million to our funded pension plans during the remainder of 2016. Contractual Cash ObligationsAs of June 30, 2016, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for the agreement we entered into to acquire PayRock as described above, which was paid with cash on hand.During the third quarter we executed an agreement to terminate our Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling rig contract, as a result we expect to make a termination payment of $113 million during the third quarter of 2016.           Environmental Matters and Other ContingenciesIn July 2015, we received a request for information from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act regarding several tank batteries used in our Bakken operations. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we have been in settlement discussions with the State of North Dakota’s Department of Health regarding potential noncompliance with the Clean Air Act, North Dakota Century Code Air Pollution Control provisions, and implementing regulations. To date, no federal or state enforcement action has been commenced in connection with this matter. We anticipate that resolution of this matter will result in civil or administrative penalties of an undetermined amount and require us to undertake corrective actions which may increase our development and/or operating costs. We do not believe that any penalties or corrective action expenditures that may result from this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows. 35Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").

If counterparty exercises, the term of the fixed-price swaps would be for the calendar year 2017 and, if all such options are exercised, 20,000 MMBtu per day. 37The following table provides a sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect on income (loss) from operations of a hypothetical 10% change in NYMEX WTI and Henry Hub prices on our open commodity derivative instruments as of June 30, 2016.

Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this Report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.38Part II – OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1. Legal and Administrative Proceedings We are a defendant in a number of legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims, tax disputes and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2015, we received a request for information from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act regarding several tank batteries used in our Bakken operations. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, we have been in settlement discussions with the State of North Dakota’s Department of Health regarding potential noncompliance with the Clean Air Act, North Dakota Century Code Air Pollution Control provisions, and implementing regulations. To date, no federal or state enforcement action has been commenced in connection with this matter. We anticipate that resolution of this matter will result in civil or administrative penalties of an undetermined amount and require us to undertake corrective actions which may increase our development and/or operating costs. We do not believe that any penalties or corrective action expenditures that may result from this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows.Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. There have been no material changes to the risk factors under Item 1A.
