Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Spin-off Downstream Business into Independent Company     On June 30, 2011, the spin-off of Marathon’s downstream (Refining, Marketing and Transportation) business was completed, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”) and Marathon Oil Corporation (“MRO”). Marathon shareholders at the close of business on the record date of June 27, 2011 received one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon common stock held. Fractional shares of MPC common stock were not distributed and any fractional share of MPC common stock otherwise issuable to a Marathon shareholder was sold in the open market on such shareholder's behalf, and such shareholder received a cash payment with respect to that fractional share. A tax ruling received in June 2011 from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) affirmed the tax-free nature of the spin-off. Activities related to the downstream business have been treated as discontinued operations in all periods presented in this Form 10-Q (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information).     Overview and Outlook   Exploration and Production   Production   Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales averaged 337 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”) during the second quarter of 2011 compared to 386 mboepd in the same quarter of 2010 and 368 mboepd during the first six months of 2011 compared to 374 mboepd in the same period of 2010. Domestic liquid hydrocarbon volumes sales increased in both periods, primarily due to the Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico which commenced production in July 2010. International liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in both periods reflect the impact of Libyan production operations being suspended during the first quarter of 2011. Additionally, second quarter liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes were lower in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 due to unplanned downtime at Alvheim and the timing of liftings in the U.K.   The Alvheim floating, production, storage and offloading (“FPSO”) vessel offshore Norway experienced a 13-day unplanned shutdown during the second quarter of 2011 to ensure the safe operation of the FPSO fire protection system. After maintenance activities, the system is fully functional and compliant with all regulatory and operational requirements.   In May 2011, significant water production and reservoir pressure declines occurred at the Droshky development. Plans for a waterflood have been cancelled and the field will be produced to abandonment pressures, expected in the first half of 2012. Consequently, 3.4 million boe of proved reserves were written off and a $273 million impairment of this long-lived asset to fair value was recorded in the second quarter of 2011.   Exploration   On June 1, 2011, we announced a definitive agreement with Hilcorp Resources Holdings, LP (“Hilcorp”) to purchase its assets in the core of the Eagle Ford shale formation in Texas in a transaction valued at $3.5 billion, subject to closing adjustments, customary terms and conditions. The transaction is expected to close on November 1, 2011. The assets                   being acquired include approximately 141,000 net acres (217,000 gross) primarily in Atascosa, Karnes, Gonzales and DeWitt counties in Texas. Approximately 90 percent of the properties are operated with 65 percent average working interest. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2011, we acquired 40,000 acres in the Eagle Ford shale and continued our exploration program with four wells drilled and being evaluated.   The Earb well offshore Norway has been determined to be dry and costs incurred through June 30, 2011 were charged to exploration expense in the second quarter of 2011. Approximately $11 million in additional well costs are expected in the third quarter of 2011.     In the second quarter of 2011, we completed drilling the Romeo prospect in the Pasangkayu block offshore Indonesia. The well was drilled in a water depth of approximately 6,300 feet and reached a total depth of 11,804 feet, but was dry. Exploration expenses for the first quarter of 2011 included well costs incurred through March 31, 2011 and additional costs of $22 million were charged to exploration expense in the second quarter of 2011. We have notified our joint venture partner and the Indonesian government that we intend to relinquish the Pasangkayu Production Sharing Contract (PSC). Discussions continue and we are awaiting a government response. We also plan to shift from an operating to a non-operating position in both the Bone Bay and Kumawa PSCs over the coming year.     In April 2011, we assigned a 30 percent undivided working interest in approximately 180,000 net acres in the Niobrara Shale play located within the DJ Basin of southeast Wyoming and northern Colorado for a total consideration of $270 million and recorded a $39 million gain. As operator of this jointly owned leasehold, we are acquiring seismic data, commenced drilling our first exploratory horizontal well in July 2011 and expect to drill eight to twelve gross wells by yearend.     Also in April 2011, we farmed-out a 40 percent working interest in 10 concessions in Poland’s Paleozoic Shale play. We are currently acquiring seismic and plan to drill one to two gross wells in the fourth quarter of 2011. In late July 2011, we sold an additional 9 percent working interest. We currently hold a 51 percent working interest in these 10 concessions and serve as operator. Our plans are to begin drilling on two wells in Poland 2011.     During the first quarter of 2011, on the Birchwood oil sands lease located in Alberta, Canada, we drilled 94 stratigraphic test wells. The drilling results are currently being evaluated. Initial results are positive, with the wells encountering expected or greater-than-expected reservoir potential.     In April 2011, we announced a discovery on the Atrush block in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. The Atrush-1 well was drilled to a total depth of approximately 11,000 feet and encountered pay in the Jurassic zones. Test flow rates were more than 6,000 gross barrels per day. We hold a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the Atrush block. A second discovery in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region was the Swara Tika-1 well on the Sarsang block. It was drilled to a total depth of approximately 12,500 feet and encountered 1,500 feet of gross oil column in the Triassic Kura Chine zones. Test flow rates totaled more than 7,000 barrels of light oil per day with associated gas. Test flow rates were limited by tubing sizes and testing equipment. We hold a 25 percent non-operated working interest in the Sarsang block. The Kurdistan Regional Government holds a 4 percent carried interest in both the Atrush and Sarsang blocks.     In March 2011, we completed our evaluation of the Flying Dutchman exploratory well, located on Green Canyon Block 511 in the Gulf of Mexico. We determined that the options to develop were not viable and reported the remaining well cost in exploration expense in the first quarter of 2011.     Dispositions   In March 2011, we closed the sale of our outside-operated interests in the Gudrun field development and the Brynhild and Eirin exploration areas offshore Norway for net proceeds of $85 million, excluding working capital adjustments. A $64 million pretax loss on this disposition was recorded in the fourth quarter 2010.   Libya     Civil unrest, which began in February 2011 in parts of North Africa, escalated to armed conflict in Libya where we have exploration and production operations. During the first quarter 2011, all production operations in Libya were suspended and we are not currently making deliveries of hydrocarbons from our interest in the Waha concession in eastern Libya. As of June 30, 2011, our net property, plant and equipment investment in Libya is approximately $762 million and our net proved reserves in Libya were 242 mmboe at December 31, 2010. Sales from Libya in 2010 averaged 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and we are in an underlift position of 847 thousand net barrels of liquid hydrocarbons. The impact of continued unrest upon our investment and future operations in Libya is unknown at this time.     In addition, payments due to the Libyan government or entities affiliated with the Libyan government have been blocked by the U.S. government under a February 25, 2011 executive order. As of June 30, 2011, such amounts, primarily related to taxes and royalties due on our January and February 2011 sales, totaled approximately $200 million.     The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the pending acquisition from Hilcorp, the intended shift from operating to a non-operating position in Indonesia, the timing and levels of future production, and anticipated future exploratory drilling activity. Some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration         22         and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorists acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The completion of the agreement to purchase asset from Hilcorp in the Eagle Ford shale formation is subject to customary closing conditions. The anticipated shift from operating to a non-operating position in both the Bone Bay and Kumawa PSCs in Indonesia is subject to obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.   Oil Sands Mining (“OSM”)   Our net synthetic crude oil sales were 41 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) in the second quarter and 39 mbpd in the first six months of 2011 compared to 20 mbpd and 22 mbpd in the same periods of 2010. The 2011 sales increase primarily reflects the impact of Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”) Expansion 1. The Jackpine mine commenced production under a phased start-up in the third quarter of 2010 and began supplying oil sands ore to the base processing facility in the fourth quarter of 2010. The upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. The planned turnaround at the Muskeg River mine and upgrader that began March 22, 2010 and halted production in April before a staged resumption of operations in May also caused 2010 sales to be lower. Incurred in the first six months of 2010, our net share of total turnaround costs was $99 million.   In the second quarter of 2011, as a result of project sanction and life extension for the greater Jackpine area, and in accordance with the terms of the original 1999 AOSP Joint Venture Agreement, we received 20 percent ownership of the portion of Lease 13 known as the Greater Jackpine Area. We added net proved developed reserves of approximately 54 million barrels.     Plans progress on the Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (“Quest CCS”) project, which would capture more than 1 million tons of carbon dioxide annually from the upgrading process and store it in underground reservoirs upon completion in 2015. In the second quarter of 2011, the operator of the AOSP announced agreements with the governments of Alberta and Canada for funding 865 million Canadian dollars, a portion of total Quest CCS costs. The financing would be done over a period of 15 years, including development, construction and 10 years of operations. However, the funding is subject to conditions of achieving certain performance objectives. A final investment decision on Quest CCS is expected to be made in 2012. We hold a 20 percent interest in the AOSP.     The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the Quest CCS project. Some factors that could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include projected costs and availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with the Quest CCS project. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.   Integrated Gas (“IG”)   Our share of LNG sales worldwide totaled 6,614 metric tonnes per day (“mtpd”) for the second quarter of 2011 compared to 6,556 mtpd in the second quarter of 2010 and 7,215 mtpd in the first six months of 2011 compared to 6,176 mtpd in the first six months of 2010. These LNG sales volumes include both consolidated sales volumes and our share of the sales volumes of equity method investees. LNG sales from Alaska are conducted through a consolidated subsidiary. The Alaska LNG plant will close following the summer of 2011. Our sales from the plant have been at much lower levels since early 2011. LNG and methanol sales from Equatorial Guinea are conducted through equity method investees. Sales volumes of both LNG and methanol are higher in the first six months of 2011 mainly due to the planned turnaround at the Equatorial Guinea gas production facilities in the first quarter of 2010, which significantly reduced natural gas volumes available to the LNG and methanol facilities.      Our outlook for U.S. natural gas prices makes it unlikely that sufficient U.S. demand for LNG will materialize by 2021, which is when the rights lapse under arrangements at the Elba Island, Georgia regasification facility. In the second quarter of 2011, we determined that the contract had no remaining fair value and recorded a $25 million impairment of this intangible asset.       Market Conditions   Exploration and Production   Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists the benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages in the second quarter and first six months of 2011, when compared to the same periods in 2010.          23                      Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,      Benchmark       2011       2010       2011       2010      West Texas Intermediate ("WTI")                                     crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 102.34     $ 78.05     $ 98.50     $ 78.46     Dated Brent crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 117.04     $ 78.24     $ 111.09     $ 77.29     Henry Hub natural gas   (Dollars per mmbtu)(a)    $ 4.32     $ 4.09     $ 4.21     $ 4.70         (a)   First-of-month price index per million British thermal units.      Crude oil prices were higher in all periods of 2011 than in 2010. Dated Brent has been at over $100 per barrel since early February and WTI at greater than $90 per barrel since late February.   Our domestic crude oil production was about 63 percent sour in the second quarter and first six months of 2011. Sour crude oil contains more sulfur than light sweet WTI. Sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of its higher refining costs and lower refined product values. Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and a majority is sold in relation to the Dated Brent crude oil benchmark.   Average natural gas prices have been less volatile in the periods presented. A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Our other major natural gas-producing regions are Europe and Equatorial Guinea, where our natural gas sales have been and, in the case of Equatorial Guinea primarily, still are subject to term contracts, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. The natural gas being sold from these regions, primarily Equatorial Guinea, is at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average natural gas realized prices may not fully track market price movements.     Oil Sands Mining   OSM segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce. Roughly two-thirds of our normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil market, primarily Western Canadian Select. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or upgrader.   The operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per unit costs are sensitive to production rate. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively.   The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the second quarter and first six months of 2011 and 2010:             Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,      Benchmark       2011       2010       2011       2010      WTI crude oil   (Dollars per barrel)    $ 102.34     $ 78.05     $ 98.50     $ 78.46     Western Canadian Select   (Dollars per barrel)(a)    $ 84.92     $ 63.95     $ 78.08     $ 66.81     AECO natural gas sales                                      index   (Dollars per mmbtu)(b)    $ 4.04     $ 3.74     $ 3.94     $ 4.27         (a)    Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada.        (b)    Monthly average of Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) day ahead index.      Integrated Gas   Our integrated gas operations include marketing and transportation of products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, primarily in the U.S., Europe and West Africa.   Our most significant LNG investment is our 60 percent ownership in a production facility in Equatorial Guinea, which sells LNG under a long-term contract at prices tied to Henry Hub natural gas prices. In general, LNG delivered to the U.S. is tied to Henry Hub prices and will track with changes in U.S. natural gas prices, while LNG sold in Europe and Asia is indexed to crude oil prices and will track the movement of those prices.   We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Equatorial Guinea through our investment in Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”). Methanol demand has a direct impact on AMPCO’s earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. AMPCO’s plant capacity of 1.1 million tones is about 3 percent of total world demand.          24          Results of Operations   Consolidated Results of Operation   Consolidated net income for 2011 was 40 percent higher in second quarter and 71 percent higher in the first six months than in the same periods of 2010. Due to the spin-off of our downstream business on June 30, 2011, which is reported as discontinued operations, income from continuing operations is more representative of Marathon Oil as an independent energy company. Income from continuing operations was 20 percent lower in second quarter and 24 percent lower in the first six months of 2011 as compared to the same periods of 2010. Higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations and sales volumes in the second quarter of 2011 were offset by higher taxes. Smaller gains on disposal of assets, a loss on early extinguishment of debt, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization and higher taxes contributed to the year to date decrease.      Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table:           Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,      (In millions)     2011       2010       2011       2010      E&P    $ 3,249     $ 2,600     $ 6,576     $ 5,073     OSM      447       190       753       370     IG      13       33       77       60                                         Segment revenues      3,709       2,823       7,406       5,503     Elimination of intersegment revenues      (15 )     (16 )     (41 )     (29 )    Total revenues    $ 3,694     $ 2,807     $ 7,365     $ 5,474       E&P segment revenues increased $649 million in the second quarter and $1,503 million in the first six months of 2011 from the comparable prior-year periods. Included in our E&P segment are supply optimization activities which include sales of crude oil and natural gas purchased from partners and nearby producers for sale to satisfy transportation commitments and achieving flexibility in product type and delivery point. Revenues from these supply optimization activities are higher in the second quarter and first six months of 2011 than in comparable periods primarily due higher crude oil prices in 2011. The increase in revenues from sale of our production was primarily a result of higher liquid hydrocarbon price realizations. Liquid hydrocarbon realizations averaged $104.93 per barrel in the second quarter and $99.89 in the first six months of 2011 compared to $73.68 and $74.00 in the same periods of 2010. Partially offsetting these revenue increases were decreased volumes, as previously discussed. Net sales volumes during the quarter were 337 mboepd in 2011 and 386 mboepd in 2010. For the first six months of 2011 net sales volumes were 2 percent lower than the comparable prior-year period.   Revenues in both 2010 periods include the impact of derivative instruments intended to mitigate price risk on future sales of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas. A net pretax gain of $29 million was reported by the E&P segment in the second quarter of 2010, while there was a net pretax gain of $78 million in the first six months of 2010.   The following tables report E&P segment realizations and sales volumes in greater detail for all periods.

OSM segment revenues increased $257 million in the second quarter and $383 million in the first six months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. The impact of derivative instruments intended to mitigate price risk relative to future sales of synthetic crude were gains of $53 million and $43 million the second quarter and first six months of 2010. All derivative positions closed in December 2010. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative instruments.     Excluding the derivative effects, segment revenues increased in both periods of 2011, as a result of higher synthetic crude realizations and volumes. Net synthetic crude sales for the second quarter of 2011 were 41 mbpd at an average realized price of $100.68 per barrel compared to 20 mbpd at $65.11 in the same period last year. For the six-month period net synthetic crude sales were 39 mbpd at $93.26 in 2011 compared to 22 mbpd at $69.94 in 2010. The 2011 sales volumes improved as a result of the Jackpine mine, which commenced operations in late 2010, and the upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter of 2011. Sales volumes in 2010 were impacted by a turnaround that commenced on March 22, 2010 that caused production to be completely shut down in April, with a staged resumption in May 2010.     Income from equity method investments increased $37 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $69 million in the first six months of 2011 from the comparable prior-year periods. Higher commodity prices positively impacted the earnings of our equity method investees.     Net gain on disposal of assets in the first six months of 2011 was primarily a gain of $39 million from assigning a 30 percent undivided working interest in the Niobrara Shale play, where we remain operator. The gain in the first six months of 2010 primarily related to the $811 million gain on the sale of a 20 percent outside-operated undivided interest in our E&P segment’s Production Sharing and Joint Operating Agreement in Block 32 offshore Angola.     Cost of revenues increased $437 million and $794 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2011 from the comparable periods of 2010 primarily due to our supply optimization activities. WTI prices increased 31 percent for the second quarter and 26 percent in the first six months of 2011.     OSM segment costs increased in total in the second quarter and first six months of 2011 when compared to the same periods of 2010 primarily due to the start-up of the Jackpine mine and upgrader expansion which included start-up costs and other cost increases associated with the increased volumes, however, on a per barrel basis costs are decreasing. These increases were partially offset by no turnaround costs in 2011. We incurred $66 million and $99 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2010 associated with the turnaround. Additionally, estimated costs of $64 million net to us have been recorded in the second quarter of 2011 to address water flow in a previously mined and contained area of the Muskeg River mine.     Purchases from related parties increased $36 million and $52 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. Our most significant related party purchases are from the Alba gas plant in Equatorial Guinea in which we own an equity interest. Higher liquid hydrocarbon prices in 2011 increased the value of those purchases.     Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) increased in the second quarter and first six months of 2011 from the comparable prior-year periods. Increased DD&A related to the higher sales volumes in our OSM segment and in our E&P segment, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.        26          Impairments in the first six months of 2011 related primarily to our Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico for $273 million and an intangible asset for a LNG delivery contract at Elba Island, as previously discussed. In 2010, impairments were primarily related to the Powder River Basin in the amount of $423 million. See Note 12 for information about these impairments.     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12 million in the second quarter and $47 million in the first six months of 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010 primarily due to additional compensation expense. The first six months of 2011 also includes higher costs of stock awards due to increased stock price of Marathon.     Exploration expenses were $145 million in the second quarter of 2011, with $62 million related to dry wells and $375 million in the first six months of 2011, including expenses related to dry wells of $220 million, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, Indonesia, and Norway. Exploration expenses were $125 million and $223 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2010, including expenses related to dry wells of $57 million and $89 million, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea.     Provision for income taxes increased $176 million in the second quarter and decreased $38 million in the first six months of 2011 from the comparable periods of 2010.     The following is an analysis of the effective income tax rates for the first six months of 2011 and 2010:           Six Months Ended June 30,          2011       2010      Statutory U.S. income tax rate      35  %     35  %   Effects of foreign operations, including foreign tax credits      11       17     Change in permanent reinvestment assertion      12       -     Adjustments to valuation allowances      -       1     Tax law change      2       2      Effective income tax rate for continuing operations      60  %     55  %     As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, we suspended production operations in Libya in the first quarter of 2011, where the statutory tax rate is in excess of 90 percent. As a result, the effects of foreign operations on our effective tax rate decreased in the first six months of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010. This decrease was partially offset by a deferred tax charge of $122 million related to an internal restructuring of our international subsidiaries in the second quarter of 2011.     In the second quarter of 2011, we recorded $716 million of deferred U.S. tax on undistributed earnings of $2,046 million that we previously intended to permanently reinvest in foreign operations. Offsetting this tax expense were associated foreign tax credits of $488 million.     We reduced our valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits by $228 million due to recognizing deferred U.S. tax on previously undistributed earnings. In addition, we recorded a valuation allowance of $18 million on our deferred tax assets related to state operating loss carryforwards. Due to the spin-off (see Note 2), we have determined it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all recorded deferred tax assets.     The effective tax rate is also influenced by a variety of factors including the geographical and functional sources of income, the relative magnitude of these sources of income, foreign currency remeasurement effects, and tax legislation changes. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of items impacting our effective tax rate.     The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in corporate and other unallocated items.     Discontinued operations reflect the June 30, 2011 spin-off of our downstream businesses and the historical results of those operations, net of tax, for all periods presented.          27              Segment Results                                             Segment income (loss) is summarized in the following table:                                     Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,      (In millions)     2011       2010       2011       2010      E&P                             United States    $ 126     $ 25     $ 157     $ 134      International      475       407       1,112       800      E&P segment      601       432       1,269       934                                        OSM      69       (60 )     101       (77 )   IG      43       24       103       68                                         Segment income      713       396       1,473       925     Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes:                                     Corporate and other unallocated items      (21 )     7       (136 )     (80 )    Foreign currency remeasurement of income taxes      (3 )     37       (17 )     70      Impairments      (195 )     (9 )     (195 )     (271 )    Loss on early extinguishment of debt      -       (57 )     (176 )     (57 )    Tax effect of subsidiary restructuring      (122 )     -       (122 )     -      Deferred income tax items      (50 )     -       (50 )     (45 )    Water abatement - Oil Sands      (48 )     -       (48 )     -      Gain on dispositions      24       -       24       449      Income from continuing operations      298       374       753       991      Discontinued operations      698       335       1,239       175     Net income    $ 996     $ 709     $ 1,992     $ 1,166       United States E&P income increased $101 million and $23 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. The income increase in the second quarter of 2011 was primarily the result of higher liquid hydrocarbon realization and sales volume increases, as previously discussed, offset by increased DD&A. For the six-month period, the increase in liquid hydrocarbon realizations and sales volume increases were partially offset by increased DD&A, exploration expenses and lower derivative revenue.     International E&P income increased $68 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $312 million in the first six months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. The income increase in the second quarter was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, as previously discussed. Liquid hydrocarbon realizations increased 43 percent and 38 percent for the second quarter and first six months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010 which increased income in the first six months when compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was partially offset by increased exploration expense in the first six months of 2011.     OSM segment income increased $129 million and $178 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2011. As previously discussed, higher sales volumes and synthetic crude realizations in the second quarter and the first six months of 2011 were the primary reasons for the increase in income. This was partially offset by increased costs and higher DD&A.     IG segment income increased $19 million and $35 million in the second quarter of 2011 and first six months of 2011 compared to the same periods of 2010. The increase was primarily the result of higher price realizations in both periods of 2011 compared to 2010.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows and Liquidity   Cash Flows   Net cash provided by continuing operations totaled $3,320 million in the first six months of 2011, compared to $1,955 million in the first six months of 2010 reflecting primarily the impact of higher liquid hydrocarbon prices on operating income.   Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1,873 million in the first six months of 2011, compared to $1,142 million in the first six months of 2010. Significant investing activities are additions to property, plant and equipment and disposal of assets. In the first half of 2011, most of the additions were in the E&P segment with continued spending on U.S. unconventional resource plays and drilling in Norway, Indonesia and the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. This compares to spending in the first half of 2010 which was more focused upon the U.S., particularly the Gulf of Mexico. Spending          28        has slowed compared to 2010 in our OSM segment as the upgrader portion of AOSP Expansion 1 was completed and commenced operations in the second quarter 2011. In the first six months of 2010, the majority of sales proceeds were from the sale of a portion of our interest in Block 32 offshore Angola. A $100 million deposit related to the pending purchase of acreage from Hilcorp in the Eagle Ford shale formation was paid in the second quarter of 2011.    For further information regarding capital expenditures by segment, see Supplemental Statistics.     Net cash used in financing activities was $1,779 million in the first six months of 2011, compared to $970 million in the first six months of 2010. Dividends paid were a significant use of cash in both periods. During the first quarter of 2011, we retired $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our debt. In the first half of 2010, we retired $500 million aggregate principal value of debt. In connection with the spin-off, we distributed $1.6 billion to MPC in the second quarter of 2011.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations and our $3.0 billion committed revolving credit facility. Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, share repurchase program, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.     Capital Resources   At June 30, 2011, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and no commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility.     Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 2 percent at June 30, 2011, compared to 14 percent at December 31, 2010. This includes $221 million of debt that is serviced by United States Steel Corporation (“United States Steel”).

This is a cash transaction valued at $3.5 billion, subject to closing adjustments, customary terms and conditions.     While the dividends will be subject to quarterly review by the respective boards, following the spin-off the aggregate $0.25 per share quarterly dividend ($1 per share per annum dividend) will be maintained by allocating the dividend as follows: Marathon Oil will pay an initial dividend of $0.15 per quarter or $0.60 per year (based on approximately 710 million shares outstanding) and MPC will pay $0.20 per quarter or $0.80 per year (based on an estimated 355 million shares outstanding). On July 27, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a dividend of 15 cents per share for the second quarter of 2011, payable September 12, 2011 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 17, 2011.     Since January 2006, our Board of Directors has authorized a common share repurchase program totaling $5 billion. As of June 30, 2011, we had repurchased 66 million common shares at a cost of $2,922 million. Purchases under the program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to          29        termination prior to completion. The program’s authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables. The timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales, cash from available borrowings and market conditions. No shares have been repurchased under this program during the period from August 2008 through June 2011.     The forward-looking statements about our common stock repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production, refining and mining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.     Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The completion of the agreement to purchase asset from Hilcorp in the Eagle Ford shale formation is subject to customary closing conditions. The forward-looking statements about our common stock repurchase program are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for crude oil, and natural gas, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production, refining and mining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.

(b)   We have the right to deliver 58 bcf of natural gas per year to the Elba Island LNG re-gasification terminal. The agreement’s primary term ends in 2021. Pursuant to this agreement, we are also committed to pay for a portion of the operating costs of the terminal.        (c)   Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.        (d)   We are party to a long-term transportation services agreement with Alliance Pipeline. This agreement was used by Alliance Pipeline to secure its financing.        (e)   Commitments on oil and gas exploration (non-capital) include estimated costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately, such as geological and geophysical costs.        (f)   Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2019. Also includes amounts for uncertain tax positions.        (g)   This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties.        Receivable from United States Steel   We remain obligated (primarily or contingently) for $225 million of certain debt and other financial arrangements for which United States Steel has assumed responsibility for repayment (see the USX Separation in Item 1. of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K). United States Steel reported in its Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2011 that it believes that its liquidity will be adequate to satisfy its obligations for the foreseeable future.   Environmental Matters     We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil, refined products and feedstocks.     In July 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency (“U.S. EPA”) finalized a Federal Implementation Plan under the Clean Air Act that includes New Source Review regulations which apply to air emissions sources in Indian country states of Wyoming, Oklahoma and North Dakota. This rule will become effective on August 30, 2011, and will require the registration and/or permitting of our facilities. We cannot reasonably estimate the impact of these new permitting requirements until the U.S. EPA finalizes its permitting procedures.     There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2010.     Other Contingencies     We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. The ultimate resolution of these contingencies could, individually or in the aggregate, be material to us. However, we believe that we will remain a viable and competitive enterprise even though it is possible that these contingencies could be resolved unfavorably to us. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.     During the second quarter, the AOSP operator determined the need and developed preliminary plans to address water flow into a previously mined and contained section of the Muskeg River mine. Estimated costs of $64 million net to us have been recorded to cost of revenues in the second quarter of 2011.          31            Critical Accounting Estimates     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.     Certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.     There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates related to continuing operations subsequent to December 31, 2010.       Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted     In May 2011, the FASB issued an update amending the accounting standards for fair value measurement and disclosure, resulting in common principles and requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The amendments change the wording used to describe certain of the U.S. GAAP requirements either to clarify the intent of existing requirements, to change measurement or expand disclosure principles or to conform to the wording used in IFRS. The amendments are to be applied prospectively and will be effective for our interim and annual periods beginning with the first quarter of 2012. Early application is not permitted. We do not expect adoption of these amendments to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.     The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended the reporting standards for comprehensive income in June 2011 to eliminate the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. All non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity are required to be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income. The amendments did not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. We are still evaluating this reporting standard, but we do not expect adoption of this amendment to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.           32            Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk     For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Disclosures about how derivatives are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how the fair values of our derivative instruments are measured may be found in Note 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.     The majority of our previous derivative activity was conducted by our downstream business. Sensitivity of the commodity derivatives and interest rate swaps related to continuing operations has not changed significantly.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures     An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarter ended June 30, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.          33          MARATHON OIL CORPORATION Supplemental Statistics (Unaudited)                                                Three Months Ended       Six Months Ended          June 30,       June 30,      (In millions)     2011       2010       2011       2010                                         Segment Income (Loss)                                     Exploration and Production                                     United States    $ 126     $ 25     $ 157     $ 134      International      475       407       1,112       800      E&P segment      601       432       1,269       934      Oil Sands Mining      69       (60 )     101       (77 )    Integrated Gas      43       24       103       68      Segment income      713       396       1,473       925      Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes      (415 )     (22 )     (720 )     66      Income from continuing operations      298       374       753       991      Discontinued operations      698       335       1,239       175      Net income    $ 996     $ 709     $ 1,992     $ 1,166     Capital Expenditures(a)                                     Exploration and Production                                     United States    $ 556     $ 412     $ 905     $ 870      International      193       173       512       318      E&P segment      749       585       1,417       1,188      Oil Sands Mining      80       243       200       508      Integrated Gas       -

Legal Proceedings   We are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain of these matters are discussed below.   In March 2011, Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (“Noble”) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Harris County, Texas alleging, among other things, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent misrepresentation, relating to a multi-year drilling contract for a newly constructed drilling rig to be deployed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We filed an answer in April 2011, contending, among other things, failure to perform, failure to comply with material obligations, failure to mitigate alleged damages and that Noble failed to provide the rig according to the operating, performance and safety requirements specified in the drilling contract. Noble is seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are vigorously defending this litigation. The ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, including any financial effect on us, remains uncertain. We do not believe an estimate of a reasonably probable loss (or range of loss) can be made for this lawsuit at this time.     Environmental Proceedings     In April 2008, the State of Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (“COGCC”) issued a Notice of Alleged Violation as a result of a release of flow-back water from a lined reserve pit in Garfield County, Colorado. No formal enforcement action was initiated by COGCC until May 2011. This matter was finalized on June 30, 2011 and a penalty in the amount of $143,350 has been paid.   In December 2008, the State of New Mexico filed a state court suit against us alleging violations of the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act. The lawsuit arose out of a February 2008 notice of violation issued to our Indian Basin Natural Gas Plant. We believe there has been no adverse impact to public health or the environment, having implemented voluntary emission reduction measures over the years. We have finalized a consent order and the court has approved it. The order required a cash penalty of $610,560 plus plant compliance projects and supplemental environmental projects estimated to cost over $5 million. We paid the cash penalty of $610,560 and entered into a Supplemental Consent Decree, approved by the court on July 30, 2010, pursuant to which we would pay $2.7 million as a civil penalty in lieu of one of the proposed supplemental environmental projects. All of these payments were made on August 11, 2010. Installation of the plant compliance projects was completed on November 15, 2010, by the current operator of the plant. We were the operator and part owner of the plant through June 2009. We are working with the other plant owners to obtain reimbursement for their share of these costs. In March 2011, the State of New Mexico found that we complied in full with the terms and Conditions of the Consent Decree (as amended by the Supplemental Consent Decree), and held that the case was dismissed, and the Consent Decree terminated. Thus, this matter is concluded.     SEC Investigation Relating to Libya   On May 25, 2011 we received a subpoena issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requiring the production of documents related to payments made to the government of Libya, or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of Libya. We have been and intend to continue cooperating with the SEC in its investigation.     Item 1A. Risk Factors   We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following is an update to our risk factors.     The potential adoption of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and gas wells.    Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand, and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process. Consideration of new federal regulation and increased state oversight continues to arise. The U.S. EPA announced in the first quarter of 2010 its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. The U.S. EPA has begun preparation for the study and expects to complete the study in 2012. In addition, various state-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale gas resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further         36         regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing.     Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal or state laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
