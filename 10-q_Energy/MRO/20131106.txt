Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as to any future date.Key Operating and Financial ActivitiesIn the third quarter of 2013, notable items were:•North America E&P net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased 35 percent over the same quarter of last year•Eagle Ford shale averaged net liquid hydrocarbon sales of 66 thousand barrels per day ("mbbld"), a 100 percent increase •Bakken shale averaged net liquid hydrocarbon sales of 36 mbbld, a 24 percent increase •Acquisition of 4,800 net acres in the core of the Eagle Ford shale in a transaction valued at $97 million including a carried interest•Labor strikes at Es Sider oil terminal in Libya since late July with no oil liftings in August or September •Norway turnaround completed in nine days, on time and on budget•Madagascar operated exploration well began drilling in deepwater Gulf of Mexico on De Soto Canyon Block 757 •Agreement in principle reached to sell our working interest in Angola Block 32 with an anticipated transaction value of $590 million, excluding purchase price adjustments•First deepwater Gabon pre-salt discovery with the non-operated Diaman-1B exploration well•Dividend increased by 12 percent to 19 cents per share•14 million common shares repurchased for $500 million at an average price of $35.53 per shareSome significant fourth quarter activities to November 6, 2013 include:•Announced receipt of approval from the Kurdistan Regional Government for the first phase in the oil development of the Atrush Block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq •Announced Mirawa-1 oil and natural gas discovery on our operated Harir block in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq•High bidder as operator on two deepwater blocks in the pre-salt play offshore Gabon: G13 and E12, which is subject to government approvals and negotiation of the exploration and production sharing contracts21Overview and Outlook North America E&PProduction Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes averaged 200 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day ("mboed") in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to 172 mboed and 155 mboed in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, for increases of approximately 16 percent and 29 percent, respectively. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, primarily reflecting the impact of our ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale resource plays, while net natural gas sales volumes decreased 19 percent and 7 percent during the same periods, primarily due to the sale of our Alaska assets in January 2013. Excluding the sales volumes related to Alaska in both nine-month periods, our average net natural gas sales volumes increased 21 percent primarily due to the previously mentioned development programs. Eagle Ford – In 2013, production growth continued in the Eagle Ford shale play. Average net sales volumes were 81 mboed and 78 mboed in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to 40 mboed and 25 mboed in the same periods of 2012. Approximately 63 percent of the first nine months of 2013 production was crude oil and condensate, 17 percent was natural gas liquids ("NGLs") and 20 percent was natural gas. In the third quarter of 2013, the amount of crude oil and condensate transported by pipeline was approximately 70 percent. The ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint.During the third quarter of 2013, we reached total depth on 70 gross operated wells and brought 71 gross operated wells to sales, with 228 gross operated wells reaching total depth and 219 gross operated wells brought on line in the first nine months of 2013. With approximately 97 percent pad drilling in the third quarter of 2013, which continues to improve efficiencies and reduce costs, our third quarter average spud-to-total depth time was 12 days, compared to 15 days spud-to-total depth in the same period of 2012.To support production growth across the Eagle Ford operating area, approximately 192 miles of gathering lines were installed in the first nine months of 2013, for a total of over 670 miles. We now have 24 central gathering and treating facilities, with one more to be completed in 2013. We continue to evaluate the potential of downspacing to 40-acre and 60-acre units, with the results of the downspacing pilots expected to be released in December 2013. We also continue to evaluate the Austin Chalk and Pearsall formations across our acreage position. To date, we have completed four Austin Chalk wells. Early Austin Chalk production results suggest that the mix of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas is similar to Eagle Ford condensate wells. Also in the second quarter of 2013, one Pearsall well was completed. Bakken – Average net sales volumes from the Bakken shale were 38 mboed in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to 30 mboed and 27 mboed in the same periods of 2012. Our Bakken production averages approximately 90 percent crude oil, 4 percent NGLs and 6 percent natural gas. During the third quarter of 2013, we reached total depth on 21 gross operated wells and brought the same number to sales. During the first nine months of 2013, we reached total depth on 61 gross operated wells and brought 56 gross operated wells to sales. Our third quarter average time to drill a well continued to improve, averaging 14 days spud-to-total depth, compared to 18 days spud-to-total depth in the same period of 2012.Oklahoma Resource Basins – Net sales volumes from the Anadarko Woodford shale averaged 15 mboed in the third quarter and 13 mboed in the first nine months of 2013 compared to 10 mboed and 7 mboed in the same periods of 2012. During the third quarter of 2013, we reached total depth on three gross operated wells and two gross operated wells were brought to sales, while during the first nine months of 2013 we reached total depth on eight gross operated wells and brought nine gross operated wells to sales. We spud two wells in the Mississippi Lime formation in central Oklahoma during October 2013 and expect to spud wells in the Granite Wash around year end.ExplorationGulf of Mexico – In September 2013, we began drilling our operated exploration well on the Madagascar prospect located on De Soto Canyon Block 757. We have reduced our working interest in the Madagascar prospect from 100 percent to 40 percent as a result of two farm-outs. We expect the well to reach total depth late in the fourth quarter of 2013.We participated in an appraisal well on the Gunflint prospect located on Mississippi Canyon Block 992 in which we hold an 18 percent non-operated working interest. The appraisal well successfully encountered 109 feet of net pay within the primary reservoir targets. After penetrating the initial appraisal targets, the well was deepened to a previously untested Lower Miocene interval. Commercial hydrocarbons were not encountered in the deeper exploration objective. Additional exploration potential remains in an adjacent structure to the north, which is a candidate for future exploration following development of the confirmed resources.22 The first appraisal well on the Shenandoah prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 51, in which we have a 10 percent non-operated working interest, reached total depth in the first quarter of 2013. This appraisal well successfully encountered more than 1,000 net feet of oil pay in multiple high-quality Lower Tertiary-aged reservoirs. Additional appraisal drilling is anticipated to begin in 2014.In the second quarter of 2013, at a total cost of $33 million, we were awarded 100 percent working interest leases in two Gulf of Mexico blocks: Keathley Canyon Block 340 on the Colonial prospect and Keathley Canyon Block 153, an extension to the Meteor prospect on our existing Keathley Canyon Block 196 lease. Keathley Canyon Blocks 340 and 153 are both inboard-Paleogene prospects. Canada – During the first quarter of 2012, we submitted a regulatory application relating to our Canada in-situ assets at Birchwood, for a proposed 12 mbbld steam assisted gravity drainage ("SAGD") demonstration project. We are expecting to receive regulatory approval for this project in mid-2014. Upon receiving this approval, we will further evaluate our development plans.International E&PProductionNet liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes averaged 231 mboed and 255 mboed during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to 280 mboed and 259 mboed in the same periods of 2012, which is 18 percent lower for the quarter and an slight decrease for the nine-month period. We had three oil liftings in Libya during July 2013 but no oil liftings in August or September due to labor strikes at the Es Sider oil terminal, for average net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes of 16 mbbld in the third quarter of 2013 compared to 49 mbbld in the same quarter of 2012. Both the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 include net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes of 9 mbbld from the PSVM development located on the northeastern portion of Angola Block 31 which had first sales in February 2013.  Equatorial Guinea – Average net sales volumes were 109 mboed and 105 mboed in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to 116 mboed and 106 mboed in the same periods of 2012. Third quarter 2012 sales volumes were higher than normal due to the timing of liquid hydrocarbon liftings. The planned turnaround that occurred in April 2013 was safely completed in 22 days, eight days ahead of schedule and below budget. Sales in the second quarter of 2013 were impacted by the turnaround, but recovered in the third quarter. Norway – Average net sales volumes from Norway were 68 mboed and 81 mboed in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to 89 mboed and 91 mboed in the same periods of 2012. A planned nine-day turnaround in Norway resulted in lower production and sales volumes during the third quarter of 2013, with rates returning to normal levels within the latter half of the quarter. Production declines, while present, continue to be less than expected as a result of strong operational performance (with unplanned downtime at less than 2 percent for the first nine months of 2013), production optimization efforts, recent infill well performance at the upper end of expectations, as well as a delay in anticipated water breakthrough at the Volund field. United Kingdom – Average net sales volumes were 24 mboed in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to 22 mboed and 23 mboed in the same periods of 2012. Production at the non-operated Foinaven field was shut-in in mid-July 2013 due to compression and subsea equipment issues and resumed at partial rates in late August. Maintenance activities as well as planned pipeline curtailments also impacted production at the operated, North Sea Brae fields during the third quarter of 2013. Sales volumes for prior-year periods were also impacted by both planned and unplanned maintenance activities as well as the timing of liquid hydrocarbon liftings. Exploration Kurdistan Region of Iraq – We hold a 45 percent operated working interest in the Harir block. In October 2013, we announced the Mirawa-1 discovery on the Harir block. The Mirawa-1 was drilled to a total depth of 14,000 feet and encountered multiple stacked oil and natural gas producing zones with equipment constrained test flow rates of more than 11 mbbld of oil, 72 million cubic feet per day ("mmcfd") of non-associated natural gas and 1,700 barrels per day of condensate. We have suspended the well for potential future use as a producing well, and moved the drilling rig to the Jisik-1 prospect located nine miles to the northwest to test a similar structure on the Harir Block. Following evaluation of the Safen-1 dry well in October, we notified the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources that we do not intend to participate in any further exploration on the Safen Block.Following the successful appraisal program on the non-operated Atrush Block and a declaration of commerciality, a plan for field development was approved by the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources in late September 2013. The development project will consist of drilling three production wells and constructing a central processing facility. We expect first production by early 2015 with estimated initial gross production of approximately 30 mbbld of oil. The approval of the field development plan for Phase 1 provides for a 25-year production period. Subject to further drilling and testing results, and partner and government approvals, a potential Phase 2 development could add an additional 30 gross mbbld facility. Within the potential Phase 2 development area, the Atrush-3 appraisal well, located approximately four miles east of existing wells, confirmed the extension 23of the oil bearing reservoir and has been suspended as a potential future producer. We hold a 15 percent working interest in the Atrush Block. On the non-operated Sarsang block, of the two exploration wells which began drilling in the second half of 2012, tests have been completed on the Gara well. All zones were water-wet and the well was plugged and abandoned in August 2013. On the Mangesh well, five drill stem tests have been completed and further testing is planned. The East Swara Tika exploration well, which began in July 2013, has been drilled to a depth of 5,300 feet toward a planned total depth of 11,000 feet. This well will test additional resource potential to the northeast of the previously announced Swara Tika discovery. We hold a 25 percent working interest in the Sarsang Block.Ethiopia – Drilling on the Tultule prospect, approximately two miles from the Sabisa-1 well on the onshore South Omo block in a frontier rift basin, commenced in September 2013 with a projected total depth of 7,900 feet. The well is expected to reach total depth by the end of the fourth quarter of 2013. The Sabisa-1 exploration well encountered reservoir quality sands, oil and heavy gas shows and a thick shale section. The presence of oil prone source rocks, reservoir sands and good seals is encouraging for the numerous fault bounded traps identified in the basin. Because of mechanical issues, the well was abandoned before a full evaluation could be completed. We hold a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the South Omo block.Gabon – The Diaman-1B well in the Diaba License G4-223 offshore Gabon reached total depth in the third quarter of 2013, encountering 160-180 net feet of hydrocarbon pay in the deepwater pre-salt play. Preliminary analysis suggests that the hydrocarbons are natural gas with condensate content, pending results of ongoing analyses of well data. We hold a 21 percent non-operated working interest in the Diaba License.In late October 2013, we were the high bidder as operator on two deepwater blocks in the pre-salt play. Award of the blocks, G13 and E12, is subject to government approvals and negotiation of the exploration and production sharing contracts.Norway – The non-operated Sverdrup exploration well on PL 330 offshore Norway that commenced drilling in June 2013 was deemed to be dry. The Darwin (formerly Veslemoy) exploration well was drilled in the first quarter of 2013 on PL 531 in which we hold a 10 percent non-operated fully-carried working interest. Gas shows were recorded in the Paleocene objective section, although no hydrocarbons were found in the Cretaceous section and the well has been plugged and abandoned. Poland – After an extensive evaluation of our exploration activities in Poland and unsuccessful attempts to find commercial levels of hydrocarbons, we have elected to conclude operations in the country. We are in the process of relinquishing the concessions. Kenya – The first exploratory well on Block 9, the Bahasi-1, began drilling in September 2013 and is expected to reach a total depth of 9,800 feet in the fourth quarter of 2013. We hold a 50 percent non-operated working interest in Block 9.Angola – The Kaombo development, located in the southeastern portion of Block 32, is expected to be sanctioned late in 2013 or early in 2014. First production from the Kaombo development is expected in 2017. See discussion of the anticipated disposal of our interest in Block 32 below. Oil Sands Mining Our Oil Sands Mining operations consist of a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”). Our net synthetic crude oil sales were 49 mbbld and 47 mbbld in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to 53 mbbld and 47 mbbld in the same periods of 2012. For the first nine months of 2013, the impact of strong reliability experienced at both mines and the upgrader during the first and third quarters of 2013, was offset by unplanned mine downtime and a planned upgrader turnaround during the second quarter of 2013.Acquisitions and DispositionsIn September 2013, we announced that we had reached an agreement in principle to sell our non-operated 10 percent working interest in the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Angola Block 32. The anticipated transaction has a value of approximately $590 million, excluding closing adjustments. Pending execution of definitive agreements and government approval, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2013.In July 2013, we acquired 4,800 net undeveloped acres in the core of the Eagle Ford shale in a transaction valued at $97 million, including carried interest of $23 million. In June 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell our non-operated 10 percent working interest in the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement in Angola Block 31. This transaction, valued at $1.5 billion before closing adjustments, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2013, subject to government and regulatory approvals. In June 2013, we closed the sale of our interests in the DJ Basin for proceeds of $19 million. A pretax loss of $114 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2013. In February 2013, we conveyed our interests in the Marcellus natural gas shale play to the operator. A $43 million pretax loss on this transaction was recorded in the first quarter of 2013.24In February 2013, we closed the sale of our interest in the Neptune gas plant, located onshore Louisiana, for proceeds of $166 million. A $98 million pretax gain was recorded in the first quarter of 2013.In January 2013, we closed the sale of our remaining assets in Alaska, for proceeds of $195 million, subject to a six-month escrow of $50 million which was collected in July 2013. After closing adjustments made in the second quarter of 2013, the pretax gain on this sale was $55 million.In January 2013, government approval was received for our acquisition of a 20 percent non-operated interest in the onshore South Omo concession in Ethiopia. As previously disclosed, we had engaged in discussions with respect to a potential sale of a portion of our 20 percent outside-operated interest in the AOSP. An agreement was not reached with the prospective purchaser and negotiations have been terminated. We are not engaged in further discussions with respect to a potential sale of these assets.We continue to progress the sale of assets in an ongoing effort to optimize our portfolio for profitable growth, with a previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3 billion over the period of 2011 through 2013. Including the anticipated sale of our interest in Angola Block 32, we have agreed upon or completed divestitures of approximately $3.5 billion, surpassing the $3 billion upper end of our three-year target. The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to expectations to spud wells in the Granite Wash, exploration drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico, Ethiopia, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Kenya, the timing of sanction and first production from the Kaombo development in Angola, the timing of first production for the Atrush Block, a potential Phase 2 development on the Atrush Block and other potential development projects, plans to exit Poland, the award of two blocks in Gabon, the timing of closing the sale of our 10 percent working interest in Block 31 offshore Angola, the anticipated sale of our 10 percent working interest in Block 32 offshore Angola, and the projected asset dispositions through 2013. The average times to drill a well may not be indicative of future drilling times. The current production rates may not be indicative of future production rates. Factors that could potentially affect the wells to be spud in the Granite Wash, exploration drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico, Ethiopia, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Kenya, the timing of sanction and first production from the Kaombo development in Angola, the timing of first production for the Atrush Block, and a potential Phase 2 development on the Atrush Block and other potential development projects include pricing, supply and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, availability of materials and labor, the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and third-party approvals and permits, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The award of two blocks in Gabon is subject to government approvals and negotiation of the Exploration and Production Sharing Contracts. The timing of closing the sale of our working interest in Block 31offshore Angola is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and obtaining necessary government and regulatory approvals. The anticipated sale of our working interest in Angola Block 32 is subject to the execution of definitive agreements and obtaining government approval. The expected timing and rate of production for the Atrush Block, the potential development of Phase 2 of the Atrush Block, plans to exit Poland and the projected asset dispositions through 2013 are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.25Market Conditions Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Worldwide prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages relative to our North America E&P and International E&P segments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 and 2012. Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,Benchmark2013201220132012West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil (Dollars per barrel)$105.81$92.20$98.20$96.16Brent (Europe) crude oil (Dollars per barrel)$110.27$109.61$108.45$112.17Henry Hub natural gas (Dollars per million British thermal units ("mmbtu"))(a)  $3.58$2.81$3.65$2.59(a) Settlement date average.North America E&PLiquid hydrocarbons – The quality, location and composition of our liquid hydrocarbon production mix can cause our U.S. liquid hydrocarbon realizations to differ from the WTI benchmark. Quality – Light sweet crude contains less sulfur and tends to be lighter than sour crude oil so that refining it is less costly and produces higher value products; therefore, light sweet crude is considered of higher quality and typically sells at a price that approximates WTI or at a premium to WTI. The percentage of our North America E&P crude oil and condensate production that is light sweet crude has been increasing as onshore production from the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays increases and production from the Gulf of Mexico declines. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, the percentage of our U.S. crude oil and condensate production that was sweet averaged 76 percent and 75 percent compared to 65 percent and 58 percent in the same periods of 2012. Location – In recent years, crude oil sold along the United States Gulf Coast, such as that from the Eagle Ford shale, has been priced based on the Louisiana Light Sweet benchmark which prices at a premium to WTI and moves similarly to Brent, while production from inland areas farther from large refineries has been priced lower. During the third quarter of 2013, the WTI discount from Brent narrowed significantly.Composition – The proportion of our liquid hydrocarbon sales that are NGLs continues to increase due to our development of United States unconventional liquids-rich plays. NGLs were 16 percent of our North America E&P liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in the third quarter and 15 percent in the first nine months of 2013 compared to 12 percent and 10 percent in the same periods of 2012. Natural gas – A significant portion of our natural gas production in the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Average Henry Hub settlement prices for natural gas were 27 percent and 41 percent higher for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods of the prior year. International E&PLiquid hydrocarbons – Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and is generally sold in relation to the Brent crude benchmark, which changed little comparing the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, but was 3 percent lower in the first nine months of 2013 than in the same period of 2012. Natural gas – Our major international natural gas-producing regions are Europe and Equatorial Guinea. Natural gas prices in Europe have been considerably higher than in the U.S. in recent years. In the case of Equatorial Guinea, our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. The natural gas sales from Equatorial Guinea are at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average natural gas realized prices may not fully track market price movements.26Oil Sands Mining The Oil Sands Mining segment produces and sells various qualities of synthetic crude oil. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader. Sales prices for roughly two-thirds of the normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil marker, primarily Western Canadian Select ("WCS"). An increase in the WTI benchmark prices, coupled with a smaller WCS discount from WTI in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period of 2012, is reflected in our improved average realizations. This narrowing of the discount began in March 2013.The operating cost structure of our Oil Sands Mining operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company ("AECO") natural gas sales index and crude oil prices, respectively. The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 and 2012: Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,Benchmark2013201220132012WTI crude oil (Dollars per barrel)$105.81$92.20$98.20$96.16WCS crude oil (Dollars per barrel)(a)$88.35$70.49$75.27$74.21AECO natural gas sales index (Dollars per mmbtu)(b) $2.35$2.27$2.99$2.03(a) Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada.(b) Monthly average AECO day ahead index.27Results of Operations Consolidated Results of OperationConsolidated income before income taxes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 was approximately 22 percent and 5 percent lower than in the same periods of 2012 primarily related to decreases in international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and average realizations. The effective tax rate was 68 percent in the first nine months of 2013 compared to 72 percent in the first nine months of 2012, with the decrease primarily related to lower income from operations in Libya and Norway, which are higher tax jurisdictions. As a result, net income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 increased 26 percent and 9 percent.Sales and other operating revenues, including related party are summarized by segment in the following table: Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(In millions)2013201220132012Sales and other operating revenues, including related party:    North America E&P$1,321$993$3,820$2,738International E&P1,3961,9075,0155,383Oil Sands Mining4634601,2041,158Segment sales and other operating revenues, including related party$3,180$3,360$10,039$9,279Unrealized gain (loss) on crude oil derivative instruments(61)45(61)45Total sales and other operating revenues, including related party$3,119$3,405$9,978$9,324 Total sales and other operating revenues decreased $286 million in the third quarter and increased $654 million in the first nine months of 2013 from the comparable prior-year periods. The $328 million and $1,082 million increases in the North America E&P segment in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 were primarily due to higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes resulting from ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale resource plays as well as higher liquid hydrocarbon realizations, partially offset by lower natural gas sales volumes, primarily the result of the sale of our Alaska assets, over the same periods of 2012. Realized losses on our North America E&P crude oil derivative instruments were $25 million and $12 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, while there were no realized gains or losses on crude oil derivative instruments in the same periods of 2012.The following table gives details of net sales volumes and average realizations of our North America E&P segment.

There were no realized gains (losses) on crude oil derivative instruments in the third quarter and first nine months of of 2012.28International E&P sales and other operating revenues decreased $511 million and $368 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 from the comparable prior-year periods. The decrease in the third quarter of 2013 was primarily due to lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in Libya and Norway, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in Angola as previously discussed. The decrease in the first nine months of 2013 was primarily due to lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in Norway and Libya and lower liquid hydrocarbon realizations, partially offset by higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in Angola.The following table gives details of net sales volumes and average realizations of our International E&P segment.

Synthetic crude oil sales volumes were lower in the third quarter of 2013; however, average realizations were higher versus the comparable 2012 period primarily due to increases in the WTI and WCS benchmark prices. The increase for the first nine months of 2013 resulted from higher synthetic crude oil average realizations primarily as a result of a larger proportion of sales attributable to a premium grade of synthetic crude oil when compared to the same period in 2012. The following table gives details of net sales volumes and average realizations of our Oil Sands Mining segment.

These crude oil derivative instruments resulted in a $61 million net unrealized loss in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to a net unrealized gain of $45 million in the same periods of 2012. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information about our derivative positions.29Marketing revenues increased $37 million in the third quarter of 2013 and decreased $640 million in the first nine months of of 2013 from the comparable prior-year periods. North America E&P segment marketing activities, formerly referred to as supply optimization activities, which include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale and represented the majority of these variances, decreased in the first nine months of 2013 due to market dynamics. Despite this year-to-date trend, there was a slight increase in the third quarter of 2013 when compared to 2012. These activities serve to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points.  Income from equity method investments decreased $8 million in the third quarter of 2013 versus the third quarter of 2012; however, it increased $49 million in the first nine months of 2013 from the comparable prior-year period, primarily due to higher LNG average realizations. Net gain (loss) on disposal of assets in the first nine months of 2013 includes a $114 million loss on the sale of our interests in the DJ Basin, a $43 million loss on the conveyance of our interests in the Marcellus natural gas shale play to the operator, a $98 million gain on the sale of our interest in the Neptune gas plant and a $55 million gain on the sale of our remaining assets in Alaska. The net gain on disposal of assets in the first nine months of 2012 consists primarily of the $166 million gain on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems and a $36 million loss related to our exit from Indonesia. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions. Production expenses decreased $26 million in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same quarter in 2012 primarily due to lower feedstock and contract labor costs in the OSM segment, partially offset by higher production expenses in the North America E&P segment related to increased sales volumes in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale plays. Production expenses increased $186 million in the first nine months of 2013 from the comparable period of 2012. The North America E&P increase is primarily related to increased sales volumes in Eagle Ford and Bakken, partially offset by lower Alaska production expenses due to the asset sale in the first quarter of 2013. The International E&P increase is primarily related to 2013 first production from Angola Block 31 and a planned Norway third quarter 2013 turnaround. The OSM segment increase is primarily related to a planned turnaround in the second quarter of 2013.Marketing expenses increased $35 million and decreased $650 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 from the same periods of 2012, consistent with the marketing revenue changes discussed above.  Exploration expenses were $17 million lower in the third quarter of 2013 than in the same quarter in 2012 due to lower unproved property impairments and geological and geophysical costs partially offset by higher dry well costs, including the Sverdrup well in Norway. Exploration costs were $274 million higher in the first nine months of 2013 than in the same period of 2012, primarily due to larger unproved property impairments. The first quarter of 2013 included $340 million in unproved property impairments on Eagle Ford shale leases that either had expired or that we do not expect to drill or extend. The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses. Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,(In millions)2013201220132012Unproved property impairments$42$78$465$148Dry well costs8335154139Geological and geophysical93048104Other19278486Total exploration expenses$153$170$751$477 Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) increased $95 million and $426 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 from the comparable prior-year periods. Our segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets; therefore, the previously discussed increases in North America E&P sales volumes generally result in similar changes in DD&A. The DD&A rate (expense per barrel of oil equivalent), which is impacted by changes in reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes in our DD&A. An increase in the North America E&P DD&A rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same prior-year periods was primarily due to the ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale resource plays. A slightly lower International E&P DD&A rate in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, was primarily due to reserve increases for Norway and partially offset the impact of the higher North America E&P rate and higher sales volumes. 30The following table provides DD&A rates for each segment.

Impairments in the first nine months of 2012 were also related to the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these impairments. Taxes other than income include production, severance and ad valorem taxes in the United States which tend to increase or decrease in relation to sales volumes and revenues. General and administrative expenses decreased $27 million and $9 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 from the same periods in 2012. The decrease in the third quarter of 2013 is primarily due to a lower pension settlement loss in the third quarter of 2013. Net interest and other increased $13 million and $49 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 from the comparable periods of 2012 primarily due to lower capitalized interest in 2013.Provision for income taxes decreased $492 million and $341 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 from the comparable periods of 2012 primarily due to the decrease in pretax income, primarily in Libya.The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to items not allocated to segments is shown in corporate and other unallocated items in the segment income table below.Our effective income tax rates in the first nine months of 2013 and 2012 were 68 percent and 72 percent. These rates are higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent due to earnings from foreign jurisdictions, primarily Norway and Libya, where the tax rates are in excess of the U.S. statutory rate. In Libya, where the statutory tax rate is in excess of 90 percent, sales decreased in the third quarter of 2013 due to labor strikes at the Es Sider oil terminal and there remains uncertainty around future production and sales levels. Reliable estimates of 2013 and 2012 annual ordinary income from our Libyan operations could not be made and the range of possible scenarios when including ordinary income from our Libyan operations in the worldwide annual effective tax rate calculation demonstrates significant variability. As such, for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, estimated annual effective tax rates were calculated excluding Libya and applied to consolidated ordinary income excluding Libya and the tax provision applicable to Libyan ordinary income was recorded as a discrete item in the periods. Excluding Libya, the effective tax rates would be 60 percent and 64 percent for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012. In the third quarter of 2013, we recorded a net favorable tax adjustment of $42 million, largely related to greater expected utilization of foreign tax credits in future periods than previously estimated.31 Segment Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(In millions)2013 2012 2013 2012North America E&P$242 $107 $404 $281International E&P321 405 1,156 1,185Oil Sands Mining106 66 164 154Segment income669 578 1,724 1,620Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes:       Corporate and other unallocated items(61) (146) (288) (294)Unrealized gain (loss) on crude oil derivative instruments(39) 29 (39) 29Net gain (loss) on dispositions— (11) (9) 72Impairments— — (10) (167)Net income$569 $450 $1,378 $1,260 North America E&P segment income increased $135 million and $123 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods of 2012. The increases are largely due to increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes primarily in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale resource plays. The third quarter increase also reflects a $92 million decrease in exploration expenses, however, the first nine months of 2013 includes unproved property impairments which partially offset the revenue increase.  International E&P segment income decreased $84 million and $29 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods of 2012. These decreases are primarily related to the lower liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and higher production expenses previously discussed, as well as increases of $75 million and $108 million in exploration expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013, partially offset by lower income taxes.  Oil Sands Mining segment income increased $40 million and $10 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods of 2012. These increases are primarily due to higher synthetic crude oil realizations.Critical Accounting EstimatesThere have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates subsequent to December 31, 2012.Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedIn June 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus on Issue 13-C, which requires that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit be presented as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for an available net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward. This accounting standards update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014 and should be applied prospectively to unrecognized tax benefits that exist as of the effective date. Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. We do not expect this accounting standards update to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.In February 2013, an accounting standards update was issued to provide guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date, except for obligations such as asset retirement and environmental obligations, contingencies, guarantees, income taxes and retirement benefits, which are separately addressed within United States generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP"). An entity is required to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date as the sum of 1) the amount the entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and 2) any amount the entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. Disclosure of the nature of the obligation, including how the liability arose, the relationship with other co-obligors and the terms and conditions of the arrangement is required. In addition, the total outstanding amount under the arrangement, not reduced by the effect of any amounts that may be recoverable from other entities, plus the carrying amount of any liability or receivable recognized must be disclosed. This accounting standards update is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2014 and should be applied retrospectively for those in-scope obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements that exist at the beginning of 2014. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this accounting standards update to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.32Cash Flows and Liquidity Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities was $4,041 million in the first nine months of 2013, compared to $2,812 million in the first nine months of 2012, primarily reflecting the impact of increased North America liquid hydrocarbon volumes on operating income.  Net cash used in investing activities totaled $3,411 million in the first nine months of 2013, compared to $4,031 million in the first nine months of 2012. Significant investing activities are additions to property, plant and equipment and disposal of assets. Additions in both periods primarily related to spending on U.S. unconventional resource plays, particularly the Eagle Ford shale. Disposals of assets totaled $402 million and $193 million in the first nine months of 2013 and 2012, with 2013 net proceeds primarily related to the sales of our interests in our Alaska assets, the Neptune gas plant, and the DJ Basin. In 2012, net proceeds resulted primarily from the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems. For further information regarding capital expenditures by segment, see Supplemental Statistics. Net cash used in financing activities was $954 million in the first nine months of 2013, compared to $1,385 million provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2012. During the first nine months of 2013, we repurchased $500 million of our common stock under our authorized share repurchase program. Repayments of debt were $148 million in the first nine months of 2013 and $111 million in the first nine months of 2012. We also drew a net $1,839 million of commercial paper in the first nine months of 2012. Dividends paid of $376 million and $360 million were a significant use of cash in both nine-month periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, the issuance of notes, our committed revolving credit facility and sales of non-strategic assets. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, share repurchase program and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.Capital ResourcesCredit Arrangements and Borrowings At September 30, 2013, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility and $200 million outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility. During the first nine months of 2013, $4,975 million of commercial paper was issued and $4,975 million of commercial paper was repaid.At September 30, 2013, we had $6,501 million in long-term debt outstanding, $68 million of which is due within one year. We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings.Anticipated Asset DisposalsThe previously discussed sale of our interest in Angola Block 31 and the agreement in principle to sell our interest in Angola Block 32 are both expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2013, subject to the execution of definitive agreements for Block 32 and government and regulatory approvals. Anticipated proceeds from these transactions are $1.5 billion and $590 million, respectively, before closing adjustments. We expect to use a portion of the proceeds to repurchase common shares as discussed below and the remainder to strengthen our balance sheet and for general corporate purposes. Shelf RegistrationWe are a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, thereby allowing us to use a universal shelf registration statement should we choose to issue and sell various types of equity and debt securities. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, we changed our reportable segments and expect to recast all periods presented to reflect these new segments in our consolidated financial statements no later than upon filing our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. When appropriate, we will update and file our universal shelf registration statement.33Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital Ratio Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 25 percent at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

As of September 30, 2013, we had repurchased 92 million common shares at a cost of $3,722 million, with 66 million shares purchased for $2,922 million prior to the spin-off of our downstream business, 12 million shares acquired at a cost of $300 million in the third quarter of 2011 and 14 million shares acquired at a cost of $500 million during the third quarter of 2013. An additional $500 million repurchase of common shares is anticipated to be completed after closing the previously discussed sale of our interest in Angola Block 31, which is expected in the fourth quarter of 2013. Purchases under the repurchase program may be in either open market transactions, including block purchases, or in privately negotiated transactions. This program may be changed based upon our financial condition or changes in market conditions and is subject to termination prior to completion. The program’s authorization does not include specific price targets or timetables. The timing of purchases under the program will be influenced by cash generated from operations, proceeds from potential asset sales, cash from available borrowings and market conditions.Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity above also contains forward-looking statements regarding the timing of closing the sales of our interests in Angola Blocks 31 and 32, including the use of proceeds, and the timing and amount of repurchasing additional common stock. The timing of closing the sale of our interest in Angola Block 31 is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and obtaining necessary government and regulatory approvals. The sale of our interest in Angola Block 32 is subject to the execution of definitive agreements and obtaining necessary government approval. The expectations with respect to the use of proceeds from the sale of our interests in Angola Block 31 and 32 and the timing and amount of repurchasing additional common stock could be affected by changes in the prices and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our exploration or production operations, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions or acts of war or terrorist acts and other operating and economic considerations. The discussion of liquidity above also contains forward-looking statements regarding planned funding of pension plans, which are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of actual performance. 34Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production or oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.Contractual Cash Obligations As of September 30, 2013, our total contractual cash obligations were consistent with December 31, 2012.          Environmental Matters We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes.There have been no significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2012.Other ContingenciesWe are a defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  See Part II Item 1. Legal Proceedings for updated information about ongoing litigation.35Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional disclosures regarding our open derivative positions, including underlying notional quantities, how they are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how their fair values are measured, may be found in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices on our open commodity derivative instruments, by contract type as of September 30, 2013 is provided in the following table.

Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our company's design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2013. In the first quarter of 2013, we completed the update of our existing Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") system. This update included a new general ledger, consolidations system and reporting tools. During the quarter ended September 30, 2013, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.36MARATHON OIL CORPORATIONSupplemental Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30,(In millions)2013 2012 2013 2012Segment Income       North America E&P$242 $107 $404 $281International E&P321 405 1,156 1,185Oil Sands Mining106 66 164 154Segment income669 578 1,724 1,620Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes(100) (128) (346) (360)Net income$569 $450 $1,378 $1,260Capital Expenditures(a)       North America E&P$831 $1,045 $2,705 $2,887International E&P254 229 720 569Oil Sands Mining65 41 207 136Corporate12 24 57 87Total$1,162 $1,339 $3,689 $3,679Exploration Expenses       North America E&P$48 $140 $559 $393International E&P105 30 192 84Total$153 $170 $751 $477(a) Capital expenditures include changes in accruals.37MARATHON OIL CORPORATIONSupplemental Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30,Net Sales Volumes2013 2012 2013 2012North America E&P       Crude Oil and Condensate (mbbld)126 98 125 88Natural Gas Liquids (mbbld)24 13 22 10Total Liquid Hydrocarbons 150 111 147 98Natural Gas (mmcfd)297 366 318 343Total North America E&P (mboed)200 172 200 155        International E&P       Liquid Hydrocarbons (mbbld)       Europe81 94 91 97Africa57 88 73 73Total Liquid Hydrocarbons138 182 164 170Natural Gas (mmcfd)       Europe(b)69 100 84 102Africa493 485 464 434Total Natural Gas562 585 548 536Total International E&P (mboed)231 280 255 259        Oil Sands Mining       Synthetic Crude Oil (mbbld)(c)49 53 47 47        Total Company (mboed)480 505 502 461Net Sales Volumes of Equity Method Investees       LNG (mtd)7,302 7,065 6,638 6,277Methanol (mtd)1,364 1,146 1,249 1,242(b) Includes natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale of 4 mmcfd and 18 mmcfd for the third quarters of 2013 and 2012, and 8 mmcfd and 16 mmcfd for thefirst nine months of 2013 and 2012.(c) Includes blendstocks.38MARATHON OIL CORPORATIONSupplemental Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30,Average Realizations2013 2012 2013 2012North America E&P       Crude Oil and Condensate (per bbl)$101.05 $89.89 $96.54 $92.00Natural Gas Liquids (per bbl)$35.01 $37.88 $34.06 $41.99Total Liquid Hydrocarbons(d)$90.49 $83.56 $87.09 $87.07Natural Gas (per mcf)$3.51 $3.61 $3.86 $3.73        International E&P       Liquid Hydrocarbons (per bbl)       Europe$113.73 $112.34 $112.12 $115.73Africa$84.58 $98.65 $92.26 $97.00Total Liquid Hydrocarbons$101.68 $105.71 $103.25 $107.69Natural Gas (per mcf)       Europe$11.61 $10.10 $11.98 $10.05Africa(e)$0.59 $0.63 $0.53 $0.39Total Natural Gas$1.95 $2.25 $2.29 $2.23        Oil Sands Mining        Synthetic Crude Oil (per bbl)$102.64 $81.13 $90.65 $83.58(d) Inclusion of realized gains (losses) on crude oil derivative instruments would have decreased average liquid hydrocarbon realizations by $1.81 per bbl and $0.30 per bbl for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013.

Legal Proceedings We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Certain of those matters are discussed below.LitigationIn March 2011, Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (“Noble”) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, alleging, among other things, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent misrepresentation, relating to a multi-year drilling contract for a newly constructed drilling rig to be deployed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We filed an answer in April 2011, contending, among other things, failure to perform, failure to comply with material obligations, failure to mitigate alleged damages and that Noble failed to provide the rig according to the operating, performance and safety requirements specified in the drilling contract. In April 2013, we filed a counterclaim against Noble alleging, among other things, breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith relating to the multi-year drilling contract. The counterclaim also included a breach of contract claim for reimbursement for the value of fuel used by Noble under an offshore daywork drilling contract. The parties have reached a tentative settlement of this litigation. We believe that the settlement of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A.
