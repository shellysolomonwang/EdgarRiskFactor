Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for a discussion of how a further downgrade in our credit ratings could affect us.37Capital ResourcesCredit Arrangements and BorrowingsAt June 30, 2017, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility. At June 30, 2017, we had $7.3 billion in long-term debt outstanding. As a result of the debt issuance discussed above, we reclassified $990 million of the 6.0% senior notes due in 2017 and 5.9% senior notes due in 2018 to long-term debt as we have the intent and ability to redeem them with the net proceeds received from the debt issuance. Therefore, as of June 30, 2017, we had long-term debt due within one year of $548 million.We do not have any triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an event of default in the case of a downgrade of our credit ratings.Shelf RegistrationWe have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we, as a "well-known seasoned issuer" for purposes of SEC rules, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Asset DisposalIn the second quarter of 2017 we closed on the sale of our Canadian business for $2.5 billion, excluding closing adjustments. Under the terms of the agreement, $1.8 billion was paid to us upon closing and the remaining proceeds of $750 million will be paid to us in the first quarter of 2018. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.Cash-Adjusted Debt-To-Capital RatioOur cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash and cash equivalents to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash and cash equivalents) was 27% at June 30, 2017, compared to 21% at December 31, 2016.

As of June 30, 2017, we plan to make contributions of up to $33 million to our funded pension plans during the remainder of 2017. In July 2017, we gave notice that we will redeem during the third quarter of 2017, $1.76 billion of the senior unsecured notes discussed above in accordance with their make-whole call provisions. As a result of this notice we expect to recognize 38into earnings an estimated loss of approximately $40 to $50 million, in loss on extinguishment of debt, during the third quarter of 2017.Contractual Cash ObligationsAs of June 30, 2017, there are no material changes to our consolidated cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts, as disclosed in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for cash obligations primarily relating to the sale of our Canadian business. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. As a result, as of June 30, 2017, our consolidated contractual cash obligations from our continuing operations has decreased by $1,239 million from December 31, 2016 primarily due to obligations relating to the sale of our Canadian business. Our purchase obligations under oil and gas activities decreased by $45 million, service and materials contracts decreased $646 million and transportation and related contracts decreased $270 million when comparing June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2016.Environmental Matters and Other ContingenciesIn July 2015, we received a request for information from the EPA under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act regarding several tank batteries used in our Bakken operations. We executed a settlement agreement with the North Dakota Department of Health relating to this matter in the fourth quarter of 2016 that includes a base penalty of $294,000 that will be reduced under the terms by mitigating corrective actions. We do not believe that any penalties or corrective action expenditures that may result from this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation or cash flows. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of other contingencies.Forward-Looking StatementsThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
