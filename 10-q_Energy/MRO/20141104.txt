Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional disclosures regarding our open derivative positions, including underlying notional quantities, how they are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how their fair values are measured, may be found in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.        The following table provides sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2014.   Incremental   Change in(In millions) Fair Value Fair ValueFinancial assets (liabilities): (a)   Interest rate swap agreements$5(b) $5Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year$(7,057)(b)(c) $(214)(a) Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, commercial paper, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(b) Fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(c) Excludes capital leases.The incremental change in fair value of our foreign currency derivative contracts of a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates at September 30, 2014 would be $35 million. Item 4. Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our company's design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2014. During the third quarter of 2014, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.37MARATHON OIL CORPORATIONSupplemental Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30,(In millions)2014 2013 2014 2013Segment Income        North America E&P$292 $242 $836 $404International E&P106 192 487 635Oil Sands Mining93 106 212 164Segment income491 540 1,535 1,203Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes(187) (144) (473) (408)Income from continuing operations304 396 1,062 795Discontinued operations (a)127 173 1,058 583Net income$431 $569 $2,120 $1,378Capital Expenditures (b)       North America E&P$1,277 $832 $3,246 $2,706International E&P166 120 386 314Oil Sands Mining49 66 172 209Corporate16 7 29 47Discontinued operations (a)125 137 376 413Total$1,633 $1,162 $4,209 $3,689Exploration Expenses       North America E&P$55 $48 $194 $559International E&P41 35 120 106Total$96 $83 $314 $665(a) We sold our Angola assets in the first quarter of 2014 and our Norway business on October 15, 2014.
