Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional disclosures regarding our open derivative positions, including underlying notional quantities, how they are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how their fair values are measured, may be found in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements.        Sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2014 is provided in the following table.   Incremental   Change in(In millions) Fair Value Fair ValueFinancial assets (liabilities): (a)   Interest rate swap agreements$11(b) $3Long-term debt, including amounts due within one year$(7,133)(b)(c) $(215)(a) Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, commercial paper, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(b) Fair value was based on market prices where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(c) Excludes capital leases.The incremental change in fair value of our foreign currency derivative contracts of a hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates at June 30, 2014 would be $47 million. Item 4. Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our company's design and operation of disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2014. During the second quarter of 2014, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.35MARATHON OIL CORPORATIONSupplemental Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30,(In millions)2014 2013 2014 2013Segment Income        North America E&P$302 $221 $544 $162International E&P160 170 381 443Oil Sands Mining55 20 119 58Segment income517 411 1,044 663Items not allocated to segments, net of income taxes(157) (170) (286) (264)Income from continuing operations360 241 758 399Discontinued operations (a)180 185 931 410Net income$540 $426 $1,689 $809Capital Expenditures (b)       North America E&P$1,102 $904 $1,969 $1,874International E&P115 107 220 194Oil Sands Mining55 98 123 143Corporate10 10 13 40Discontinued operations (a)141 138 251 276Total$1,423 $1,257 $2,576 $2,527Exploration Expenses       North America E&P$82 $76 $139 $511International E&P63 49 79 71Total$145 $125 $218 $582(a) We sold our Angola assets in the first quarter of 2014 and entered into an agreement to sell our Norway business in June 2014.
