Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Key Operating and Financial ActivitiesIn the third quarter of 2012, notable items were:•Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales volumes of 452 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboed”), of which 65 percent was liquid hydrocarbons•Net international liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, for which average realizations have exceeded West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil, were 62 percent of total liquid hydrocarbon sales•Eagle Ford shale average net sales volumes of 40 mboed, an increase of 90 percent from the second quarter of 2012•Production from Libya increased over the second quarter of 2012, with average net sales of 53 mboed •Bakken shale average net sales volumes of 30 mboed, a 87 percent increase over the same quarter of last year•Closed the acquisition of Paloma Partners II, LLC•Assumed operatorship of the Vilje field offshore NorwaySome significant fourth quarter activities through November 7, 2012 include:•Closed acquisition of an additional 4,300 net acres in the core of the Eagle Ford shale•Signed agreement for a 20 percent non-operated interest in the South Omo concession onshore Ethiopia•Reentered Gabon by acquiring an interest in an exploration license•Acquired interests in two onshore exploration blocks in Kenya•Farmed out 35 percent working interests in the Harir and Safen blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq•Issued $2 billion of senior notes 21Overview and OutlookExploration and ProductionProduction Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales averaged 452 mboed during the third quarter and 414 mboed in the first nine months of 2012 compared to 349 mboed and 362 mboed in the same periods of 2011. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes increased in the U.S. for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, reflecting the impact of production from the Eagle Ford shale assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2011 and our ongoing development programs in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Anadarko Woodford shale resource plays. The resumption of sales from Libya in the first quarter of 2012 after production had ceased there in February of 2011 was the most significant increase in international sales volumes. In addition, net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from the U.K. were lower in the 2012 periods than in the same periods of 2011 due to turnarounds in the third quarter and the timing of liftings.In 2012, we continued to ramp up operations in the core of the Eagle Ford shale play in Texas. Average net sales volumes from the Eagle Ford shale were 40 mboed and 25 mboed in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. As announced in August, we have reduced our rig count to 18 operated rigs while maintaining four dedicated hydraulic fracturing crews and two more on a spot basis. During the third quarter of 2012, we drilled 78 gross wells and brought 73 gross wells to sales for a total of 180 gross wells drilled in the first nine months of 2012. Our average time to drill a well in the Eagle Ford shale has decreased to approximately 24 days; therefore, we now expect to drill 250 to 260 gross Eagle Ford wells during 2012, an increase of approximately 20 wells from previous estimates. In addition to the improvements in the speed and efficiency in drilling and completions, we continue to optimize well spacing which could significantly increase drillable locations and recoverable resources. We have been performing spacing pilot programs in the Eagle Ford shale which will complete early in 2013 so that we will have applicable technical results by mid-year. To complement drilling and completion activity in the Eagle Ford shale, we continue to build infrastructure to support production growth across the operating area. We are now able to transport approximately 60 percent of our Eagle Ford production by pipeline. Average net sales volumes from the Bakken shale were 30 mboed and 27 mboed in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to 17 mboed and 15 mboed in the same periods of 2011. Our Bakken shale liquid hydrocarbon volumes averaged approximately 90 percent crude oil, 5 percent natural gas liquids and 5 percent natural gas in the first nine months of 2012. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, we drilled 25 gross and 72 gross wells with seven rigs, with a total of 30 gross and 77 gross wells brought to sales in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012. By the end of October 2012, we had reduced our operated rig count in the Bakken shale to five. We continue to focus on downspacing and development in the Three Forks area. In the Anadarko Woodford shale, net sales volumes averaged 10 mboed and 7 mboed during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to 2 mboed and 2 mboed in the same periods of 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, eight gross wells were brought to sales, with 14 gross wells brought to sales in the first nine months of 2012. As announced in August, in response to the continued decline in natural gas liquids prices and low natural gas prices, we have reduced our rig count in the Anadarko Woodford play from six to two. Other areas of potential growth exist in Oklahoma and we are currently evaluating opportunities on legacy assets where the acreage is held by production. Future activity in these Oklahoma resource basins will be dependent upon the recovery of natural gas and natural gas liquids prices. In the first quarter 2011, production operations in Libya were suspended. In the fourth quarter of 2011, limited production resumed and has increased during 2012 so that during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, net sales volumes averaged 53 mboed and 51 mboed. We and our partners in the Waha concessions continue to assess the condition of our assets in Libya and uncertainty around sustained production and sales levels remains.  In June 2012, we submitted a plan for the development and operation of the Boyla field (PL 340) in the North Sea to the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, which was approved in October 2012. The Boyla field is located approximately 17 miles south of our operated Alvheim field. We hold a 65 percent working interest in the field. First production from Boyla is expected in the fourth quarter of 2014. In the second quarter of 2012, we completed a four-day turnaround in Norway that was originally scheduled for 14 days in the third quarter. During the third quarter of 2012, we became operator of the Vilje field offshore Norway in which we own a 47 percent interest. A 28-day turnaround began at our production operations in Equatorial Guinea on March 23, 2012. It was completed in April 2012, seven days ahead of schedule and below budget.Our Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico began production in December 2011. During the first quarter of 2012, production rates declined significantly and have remained below initial expectations. Accordingly, our reserve engineers performed 22an evaluation of our future production as well as our reserves which concluded in early April 2012. This resulted in a 2 million barrels of oil equivalent reduction in proved reserves and a $261 million impairment charge in the first quarter of 2012.ExplorationThe appraisal well on the Shenandoah prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 51 in the Gulf of Mexico, in which we have a 10 percent outside-operated working interest, is currently drilling. In the third quarter of 2012, we resumed drilling the exploration well on the Gulf of Mexico Innsbruck prospect on Mississippi Canyon Block 993 in which we hold a 45 percent operated working interest. Through September 30, 2012, our net costs related to the well were $71 million. The well has drilled through multiple horizons with no commercial hydrocarbons found as of November 6, 2012. We anticipate reaching total depth within the next few days at a total net cost, including asset retirement obligations and leasehold costs, of approximately $100 million.  In the second quarter of 2012, a Gunflint prospect appraisal well confirmed expected reservoir properties and continuity, establishing the commercial viability of the field. The Gunflint discovery is located on Mississippi Canyon Block 948 and we have a 15 percent outside-operated working interest in the prospect. During the second quarter of 2012, the well costs and related unproved property costs related to the Kilchurn well were charged to exploration expenses. We continue exploratory drilling in Poland where we hold a 51 percent working interest in 10 operated concessions and a 100 percent working interest in one concession. We have drilled 4 exploratory wells and are currently drilling a fifth well. We have collected extensive data, including well logs and core samples, which are being evaluated. We plan to begin a sixth well by year end 2012 which should reach total depth in 2013. In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, we began drilling our first operated exploration well on the Harir block in July 2012 and plan to drill an operated exploration well on the Safen block in the first quarter of 2013. After the farm out discussed below, we have 45 percent working interests in both the Harir and Safen blocks. On the non-operated Atrush block, we participated in an appraisal well during the third quarter of 2012. Additionally, we participated in a non-operated well that commenced drilling on the Sarsang block in September 2012. We hold a 20 percent working interest in the Atrush block and a 25 percent working interest in the Sarsang block.During the first quarter of 2012, on the Birchwood oil sands lease located in Alberta, Canada, we conducted a seismic survey and drilled six water wells. We also submitted a regulatory application for a proposed 12 thousand barrel per day (“mbbld”) steam assisted gravity drainage ("SAGD") project at Birchwood. Pending regulatory approval, project sanction is expected in 2014, with first oil projected in 2017. We have a 100 percent working interest in Birchwood. Acquisitions and DispositionsWe continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio for profitable growth through acquisitions and dispositions, with a previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3 billion over the period of 2011 through 2013. To date, we have entered into agreements for approximately $1.1 billion in divestitures, of which more than $700 million have been completed. Included in the $1.1 billion noted above is the pending sale of our Alaska assets which is discussed below.  On November 1, 2012, we closed the acquisition of an additional 4,300 net acres in the core of the Eagle Ford shale at a transaction cost of approximately $232 million before closing adjustments. This acquisition increased our average working interest by 5 to 7 percent in four core areas of mutual interest, included wells producing 3 net mboed at closing, and added 40 net drilling locations to our inventory. The closing of this transaction combined with the acquisition of Paloma Partners II, LLC ("Paloma acquisition"), brings our acquisitions thus far in 2012 in the core of the play to almost 25,000 additional net acres at an approximate cost of $1 billion. The Paloma acquisition closed in August 2012 as discussed below. We now have approximately 230,000 net acres in the core of the Eagle Ford shale. The unproved property costs related to an additional 100,000 non-core net acres were impaired in the third quarter of 2012 as discussed below in Results of Operations.In October 2012, we entered into an agreement to acquire a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the South Omo concession onshore Ethiopia with an effective date of August 17, 2012. An exploration well is anticipated to commence drilling in South Omo during the fourth quarter of 2012. Cash consideration for this transaction will be $40 million, before closing adjustments, with an additional payment of $10 million due upon declaration of a commercial discovery. We expect to close the transaction, subject to necessary Ethiopian government approvals, before the end of 2012.We acquired approximately 20,000 net acres in the core of the Eagle Ford shale during the first nine months of 2012. The largest transaction was the acquisition of Paloma Partners II, LLC, which closed August 1, 2012 for cash consideration of $768 million. In addition to the over 17,100 net acres acquired, at closing 17 gross operated and 9 gross non-operated wells were producing an average of 9 net mboed, of which 70 percent was liquid hydrocarbons. Smaller transactions closed during the second quarter of 2012. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the Paloma acquisition.In the third quarter of 2012, we sold approximately 5,800 net undeveloped acres located outside the core of the Eagle Ford shale for proceeds of $9 million, recording a loss of $18 million. 23In July 2012, we entered into an agreement to acquire outside-operated positions in two onshore exploration blocks in northwest Kenya. Upon closing the $35 million transaction in October 2012, we now hold a 50 percent working interest in Block 9, where an exploration well is currently planned in mid-2013, and a 15 percent working interest in Block 12A.  Also in July 2012, we agreed to farm out interests in the Harir and Safen blocks in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The transaction closed in October 2012 and we received cash proceeds of $140 million, so that we now have a 45 percent working interest and carry the KRG for an additional 11 percent in each of the two blocks. In June 2012, we entered an agreement to acquire a 21 percent outside-operated working interest in the Diaba License G4-223 and its related permit onshore Gabon. The transaction closed in October 2012. The start of exploration drilling is expected in the first quarter of 2013.During June 2012, we signed a new production sharing contract with the government of Equatorial Guinea for the exploration of Block A-12 offshore Bioko Island, located immediately west of our operated Alba Field. We have an 80 percent operated working interest in this block. The contract was ratified by the government in the third quarter of 2012. We also acquired an additional interest in Block D, bringing our working interest to 80 percent.In May 2012, we executed agreements to relinquish our E&P segment’s operatorship of and participating interests in the Bone Bay and Kumawa exploration licenses in Indonesia. As a result, we accrued and reported a $36 million loss on disposal of assets in the second quarter of 2012. Government ratification of the agreements was received during the third quarter of 2012, which released us from our obligations and further commitments related to these licenses, and we paid the amount accrued. In April 2012, we entered agreements to sell our Alaska assets. One transaction closed in the second quarter of 2012 with proceeds and a net gain of $7 million. The remaining transaction, with a value of $375 million before closing adjustments, is currently under review by the Federal Trade Commission and the Alaska Attorney General's office, which could impact the closing of this transaction.In January 2012, we closed on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems for proceeds of $206 million. This includes our equity method interests in Poseidon Oil Pipeline Company, L.L.C. and Odyssey Pipeline L.L.C., as well as certain other oil pipeline interests, including the Eugene Island pipeline system. A pretax gain of $166 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2012.The above discussions include forward-looking statements with respect to the expected production in the Eagle Ford, Anadarko Woodford and Bakken plays, timing of first production from the Boyla field, anticipated drilling rig and drilling activity, the sale of our Alaska assets, possible increased recoverable resources from optimized well spacing in the Eagle Ford resource play, the expected closing of an agreement in Ethiopia, anticipated exploration activity in Ethiopia, Gabon, Poland and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the timing of the commencement of construction and first oil on the SAGD project. The projected asset dispositions through 2013 are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Factors that could potentially affect the expected production in the Eagle Ford, Anadarko Woodford and Bakken plays, timing of first production from the Boyla field, exploratory activity in Ethiopia, Gabon, Poland and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, possible increased recoverable resources from optimized well spacing in the Eagle Ford resource play and anticipated drilling rig and drilling activity include pricing, supply and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, timing of commencing production from new wells, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The completion of the sale of our Alaska assets is subject to necessary government and regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. The agreement in Ethiopia is subject to government approvals. The timing of commencement of construction and first oil on the SAGD project can be affected by delays in obtaining and conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals, board approval, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, and the other risks associated with construction projects. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the our control and difficult to predict. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Oil Sands Mining Our OSM operations consist of a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”). As announced in October 2012, we have engaged in discussions with respect to a potential sale of a portion of our 20 percent interest. Given the uncertainty of such a transaction, potential proceeds have not been included in our previously stated goal of divesting between $1.5 billion and $3 billion between 2011 and 2013. Our net synthetic crude oil sales were 53 mbbld and 47 mbbld in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to 50 mbbld and 43 mbbld in the same periods of 2011. The upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the third quarter of 2011 and subsequent periods’ sales volumes have increased as a result. With production capacity at the AOSP 24now at 255,000 gross barrels per day, the focus will be on improving operating efficiencies and adding capacity through debottlenecking. The Energy and Resources Conservation Board, Alberta’s primary energy regulator, conditionally approved the AOSP’s Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (“Quest CCS”) project in July 2012. The AOSP partners approved Quest CCS in the third quarter of 2012. The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with regard to discussions with respect to a potential sale of a portion of our 20 percent interest in the AOSP. The potential sale of a portion of our interest in the AOSP is subject to successful negotiations and execution of definitive agreements. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Integrated Gas LNG and methanol sales from Equatorial Guinea are conducted through equity method investees that purchase dry gas from our E&P assets in Equatorial Guinea. Our share of LNG sales totaled 7,065 metric tonnes per day (“mtd”) for the third quarter and 6,277 mtd for the first nine months of 2012 compared to 6,935 mtd and 7,121 mtd in the same periods of 2011. For the first nine months, LNG sales volumes are below the prior year due to a turnaround in the second quarter of 2012 at the facility in Equatorial Guinea, but primarily because the first nine months of 2011 also included LNG sales from Alaska, which ceased when our interest in that production facility was sold in the third quarter of 2011. Market ConditionsExploration and Production Prevailing prices for the various qualities of crude oil and natural gas that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices have been volatile in recent years. The following table lists benchmark crude oil and natural gas price averages in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,Benchmark2012 2011 2012 2011WTI crude oil (Dollars per barrel)$92.20 $89.54 $96.16 $95.47Brent (Europe) crude oil (Dollars per barrel)$109.61 $113.46 $112.17 $111.93Henry Hub natural gas (Dollars per million        British thermal units ("mmbtu"))(a)  $2.81 $4.19 $2.59 $4.16(a) Settlement date average.Average WTI crude oil benchmark prices increased 3 percent in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter of 2011. Our international crude oil production is relatively sweet and a majority is sold in relation to the Brent crude oil benchmark, which was 3 percent lower in the third quarter of 2012 than the same quarter of 2011. Both crude benchmarks were relatively flat on average when comparing the nine-month periods of 2012 and 2011.  Our domestic crude oil production was about 35 percent sour in the third quarter and 42 percent sour in the first nine months of 2012 compared to 64 percent and 62 percent in the same periods of 2011. Reduced production from the Gulf of Mexico and increased onshore production from the Bakken and Eagle Ford shale plays contributed to the lower sour crude percentage in 2012. Sour crude oil contains more sulfur than light sweet WTI. Sour crude oil also tends to be heavier than and sells at a discount to light sweet crude oil because of its higher refining costs and lower refined product values.A significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is sold at bid-week prices, or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas. Average Henry Hub settlement prices for natural gas were lower for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods of the prior year. A decline in average settlement date Henry Hub natural gas prices began in September 2011 and continued into 2012. Although prices have stabilized recently, they have not increased appreciably.  Our other major natural gas-producing regions are Europe and Equatorial Guinea. Natural gas prices in Europe have been higher than in the U.S. in recent periods. In the case of Equatorial Guinea, our natural gas sales are subject to term contracts, making realized prices in these areas less volatile. The natural gas sales from Equatorial Guinea are at fixed prices; therefore, our reported average natural gas realized prices may not fully track market price movements.25Oil Sands Mining OSM segment revenues correlate with prevailing market prices for the various qualities of synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil we produce. Roughly two-thirds of our normal output mix will track movements in WTI and one-third will track movements in the Canadian heavy sour crude oil market, primarily Western Canadian Select (“WCS”). In 2012, the WCS discount from WTI has increased, bringing down our average price realizations. Output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mines or upgrader.  The operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed, and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime, making per unit costs sensitive to production rate. Key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel, which track commodity markets such as the Canadian Alberta Energy Company (“AECO”) natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively.The table below shows benchmark prices that impacted both our revenues and variable costs for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 and 2011: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,Benchmark2012 2011 2012 2011WTI crude oil (Dollars per barrel)$92.20 $89.54 $96.16 $95.47Western Canadian Select (Dollars per barrel)(a)$70.49 $72.14 $74.21 $76.10AECO natural gas sales index (Dollars per mmbtu)(b) $2.27 $3.70 $2.03 $3.86(a) Monthly pricing based upon average WTI adjusted for differentials unique to western Canada.(b) Monthly average AECO day ahead index.Integrated Gas We have a 60 percent ownership in a production facility in Equatorial Guinea, which sells LNG under a long-term contract principally based upon Henry Hub natural gas prices. We own a 45 percent interest in a methanol plant located in Equatorial Guinea. Methanol demand has a direct impact on the plant’s earnings. Because global demand for methanol is rather limited, changes in the supply-demand balance can have a significant impact on sales prices. The plant capacity of 1.1 million tonnes is about 2 percent of 2011 estimated world demand.Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operation Due to the spin-off of our downstream business on June 30, 2011, which is reported as discontinued operations, income from continuing operations is more representative of Marathon Oil as an independent energy company. Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes in the third quarter of 2012 was 33 percent higher than in the same period of 2011 primarily due to the previously discussed resumption of our operations in Libya. The effective tax rate was 74 percent in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 69 percent in the third quarter of 2011, with the increase related to higher income from continuing operations in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily Libya. Consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes in the first nine months of 2012 was 40 percent higher than in the same period of 2011 primarily due to increased income in Libya. As a result of increased income from continuing operations before tax in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily Norway and Libya, the effective tax rate was 72 percent for the first nine months of 2012 compared to 64 percent for the same period of 2011.26 Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(In millions)2012 2011 2012 2011E&P$3,519 $3,212 $10,327 $9,788OSM470 427 1,184 1,180IG— 16 — 93Segment revenues3,989 3,655 11,511 11,061Unrealized gain on crude oil derivative instruments45 — 45 —Elimination of intersegment revenues— (6) — (47)Total revenues$4,034 $3,649 $11,556 $11,014 E&P segment revenues increased $307 million in the third quarter and $539 million in the first nine months of 2012 from the comparable prior-year periods. Included in our E&P segment are supply optimization activities which include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. Supply optimization serves to aggregate volumes in order to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Volumes associated with supply optimization have been decreasing in 2012 due to market dynamics and related commodity prices have also been lower in 2012. See the Cost of revenues discussion as revenues from supply optimization approximate the related costs. Revenues from the sale of our U.S. production are higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 primarily as a result of increased liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes from our U.S. shale plays. Lower liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas realizations partially offset the volume impact. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our U.S. operations. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012 2011 2012 2011United States Operating Statistics        Net liquid hydrocarbon sales (mbbld) (a)111 69 98 73 Liquid hydrocarbon average realizations (per bbl) (b)$83.80 $88.89 $86.98 $91.53        Net natural gas sales (mmcfd)366 296 343 326 Natural gas average realizations (per mcf)(b)$3.61 $4.85 $3.73 $5.04(a)Includes crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids.(b)Excludes gains and losses on derivative instrumentsRevenues from our international operations are higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 primarily as a result of the previously discussed resumption of liquid hydrocarbon sales from Libya. Higher average liquid hydrocarbon realizations during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 also contributed to the revenue increase for both periods. 27The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our international operations.

The upgrader expansion was completed and commenced operations in the third quarter of 2011, resulting in higher sales volumes in both periods. However, an increase in the discount of WCS to WTI resulted in the decreases in average realizations during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, partially offsetting the positive volume variance. The following table gives details of net sales and average realizations of our OSM operations. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2012 2011 2012 2011OSM Operating Statistics        Net synthetic crude oil sales (mbbld) (a)53 50 47 43Synthetic crude oil average realizations (per bbl)$81.13 $87.29 $83.58 $90.91(a) Includes blendstocks.IG segment revenues decreased $16 million in the third quarter and $93 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. Sales of LNG from our Alaska operations ceased in the third quarter of 2011 when we sold our interest in this production facility.Unrealized gain on crude oil derivative instruments is included in total revenues but not segment revenues. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, the net unrealized gain on crude oil derivative instruments was $45 million and there was no comparable derivative activity in similar periods of 2011. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information about our derivative positions. Income from equity method investments decreased $100 million in the first nine months of 2012 from the comparable prior-year period, primarily due to lower natural gas prices and turnarounds early in 2012 at our facilities in Equatorial Guinea. Also, in January 2012, we sold our equity investments in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipelines.28Net gain (loss) on disposal of assets in the third quarter of 2012 primarily reflects an $18 million loss on the sale of undeveloped acreage outside the core of the Eagle Ford shale resource play. The net gain on disposal of assets in the first nine months of 2012 consists primarily of the $166 million gain on the sale of our interests in several Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline systems, reduced by the $36 million loss on the assignment of our Bone Bay and Kumawa exploration licenses in Indonesia and the $18 million loss on the Eagle Ford acreage. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.Cost of revenues decreased $304 million and $666 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 from the comparable periods of 2011 primarily due to our supply optimization activities. Volumes associated with supply optimization have been decreasing in 2012 due to market dynamics and related commodity prices have also been lower in 2012. Comparatively, costs related to supply optimization were lower by $438 million for the third quarter and by $677 million for the first nine months of 2012. Excluding the impact of supply optimization activities, E&P segment operating expenses have increased in proportion to our increased production from U.S. shale plays. Additionally, Integrated Gas segment costs are lower in 2012 due to the sale of our interest in the Alaska LNG facility in the third quarter of 2011.  Depreciation, depletion and amortization (“DD&A”) increased $108 million in the third quarter and $63 million in the first nine months of 2012 from the comparable prior-year periods. Because both our E&P and OSM segments apply the units-of-production method to the majority of their assets, the previously discussed increases in sales volumes generally result in similar changes in DD&A. The DD&A rate (expense per barrel of oil equivalent), which is impacted by changes in reserves and capitalized costs, can also cause changes in our DD&A. Lower U.S. and International E&P DD&A rates in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011 partially offset the impact of higher sales volumes in those periods. Also, there was no depletion of our Alaska assets in the second and third quarters of 2012 because they are held for sale. The following table provides DD&A rates for our E&P and OSM segments. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,($ per boe)2012 2011 2012 2011DD&A rate       E&P Segment       United States$23 $24 $23 $26International8 10 9 10OSM Segment$6 $6 $6 $6 Impairments in the first nine months of 2012 related primarily to the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico. Impairments in the first nine months of 2011 related primarily to the Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico and an intangible asset for an LNG delivery contract at Elba Island. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information about these impairments.General and administrative expenses increased $35 million in the third quarter and $18 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods in 2011. The third quarter of 2012 includes pension settlement expense of $34 million. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for information about the pension settlement. The cost increase for the nine-month period of 2012 is lower because 2011 included higher incentive compensation expense due to the increase in Marathon’s stock price in the period leading up to the spin-off. Exploration expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2012 than in the same quarter of 2011, primarily due to larger unproved property impairments. The third quarter of 2012 included $51 million related to unproved property impairments associated with approximately 100,000 net non-core acres in the Eagle Ford shale. Exploration expenses were lower in the first nine months of 2012 than in the previous year, primarily due to dry wells in the Gulf of Mexico, Norway and Indonesia in 2011 compared to one dry Gulf of Mexico well plus various U.S. onshore dry wells in 2012; however, higher unproved property impairments in the Marcellus shale, Eagle Ford shale and Indonesia in 2012 partially offset this decrease. Geological and geophysical (“G&G”) costs increased in the nine months of 2012 primarily related to activity in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the seismic survey on our Birchwood oil sands in-situ lease. 29The following table summarizes the components of exploration expenses.

Foreign currency gains were lower in the third quarter of 2012 than in the same quarter of 2011. In addition, capitalized interest has been lower in both periods of 2012. Loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to debt retirements in February and March of 2011. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these transactions.Provision for income taxes increased $381 million and $1,180 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 from the comparable periods of 2011 primarily due to the increase in pretax income in high tax rate jurisdictions, including the impact of the previously discussed resumption of sales in Libya in the first quarter of 2012.The effective income tax rate is influenced by a variety of factors including the geographic and functional sources of income and the relative magnitude of these sources of income. The provision for income taxes is allocated on a discrete, stand-alone basis to pretax segment income and to individual items not allocated to segments. The difference between the total provision and the sum of the amounts allocated to segments and to individual items not allocated to segments is reported in “Corporate and other unallocated items” in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.Our effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2012 was 72 percent. This rate is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings from foreign jurisdictions, primarily Norway and Libya, where the tax rates are in excess of the U.S. statutory rate. An increase in earnings and associated taxes from foreign jurisdictions, primarily Norway, as compared to prior periods caused an increase in our valuation allowance on current year foreign tax credits. In Libya, where the statutory tax rate is in excess of 90 percent, limited production resumed in the fourth quarter of 2011 and liquid hydrocarbon sales resumed in the first quarter of 2012. A reliable estimate of 2012 annual ordinary income from our Libyan operations cannot be made and the range of possible scenarios when including ordinary income from our Libyan operations in the worldwide annual effective tax rate calculation demonstrates significant variability. As such, for the first nine months of 2012, an estimated annual effective tax rate was calculated excluding Libya and applied to consolidated ordinary income excluding Libya and the tax provision applicable to Libyan ordinary income was recorded as a discrete item in the period. Excluding Libya, the effective tax rate would be 64 percent for the first nine months of 2012.Our effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2011 was 64 percent which is higher than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent primarily due to earnings from foreign jurisdictions where the tax rates are in excess of the U.S. statutory rate and the valuation allowance recorded against 2011 foreign tax credits. In addition, in the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a deferred tax charge related to an internal restructuring of our international subsidiaries. Discontinued operations reflect the June 30, 2011 spin-off of our downstream business and the historical results of those operations, net of tax, for all periods presented.30 Segment Results  Segment income is summarized in the following table.

The income increase in both periods was primarily the result of higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes as previously discussed, partially offset by lower liquid hydrocarbon realizations and the impact of increased production operations on DD&A and operating expenses. In addition, exploration expenses were higher primarily due to higher unproved property impairments.  International E&P income increased $127 million in the third quarter and decreased $271 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. Segment income, before taxes, increased in both periods primarily due to the previously discussed higher liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and realizations, partially offset by increased operating costs. As previously discussed, increased income before tax in higher tax jurisdictions resulted in a higher effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011.  OSM segment income decreased $27 million and $36 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. As previously discussed, lower synthetic crude oil price realizations were the primary reason for the decrease in income. This was partially offset by decreased costs on a per unit basis and higher sales volumes.IG segment income decreased $16 million and $102 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011 primarily due to lower natural gas prices and turnarounds early in 2012 at our facilities in Equatorial Guinea. In addition, LNG sales volumes are lower in the first nine months of 2012 due to the sale of our interest in the Alaska LNG facility in the third quarter of 2011.Critical Accounting EstimatesThere have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates subsequent to December 31, 2011.31Cash Flows and Liquidity Cash Flows Net cash provided by continuing operations was $2,812 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared to $4,400 million in the first nine months of 2011 primarily reflecting the impact of lower U.S. liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas prices on operating income and higher cash tax payments. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for amounts of the cash tax payments. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $4,031 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared to $2,118 million related to continuing operations in the first nine months of 2011. Significant investing activities are additions to property, plant and equipment and disposal of assets. In the first nine months of 2012, most of the additions were in the E&P segment with continued spending on U.S. unconventional resource plays, particularly the Eagle Ford shale. This compares to additions in the first nine months of 2011 which also included spending on U.S. unconventional resource plays, though at a lower level, and drilling in Norway, Indonesia and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. In the first nine months of 2012, expenditures for acquisitions totaled $806 million primarily related to acquiring additional Eagle Ford shale properties. Deposits totaling $120 million were paid in the first nine months of 2011 related to the Eagle Ford shale acreage acquisitions that closed later that year. For further information regarding capital expenditures by segment, see Supplemental Statistics. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,385 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared to net cash used in financing activities related to continuing operations of $5,098 million in the first nine months of 2011. During the first nine months of 2012, we drew a net $1,839 million under our commercial paper program, retired $23 million principal amount of debt before it was due and repaid $88 million of debt upon its maturity. During the first nine months of 2011, we retired $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our debt before it was due and distributed $1.6 billion to Marathon Petroleum Corporation in connection with the spin-off of the downstream business. Dividends paid were a significant use of cash in both periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our main sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, internally generated cash flow from operations, the issuance of notes, our committed revolving credit facility, and sales of non-strategic assets. Our working capital requirements are supported by these sources and we may issue commercial paper backed by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements. We issued $10.4 billion and repaid $8.6 billion of commercial paper in the first nine months of 2012 leaving a balance of $1.8 billion outstanding at September 30, 2012. After September 30, 2012, we continued to utilize our sources of liquidity, including additional issuances of commercial paper and notes as discussed below, to fund working capital requirements. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including our capital spending programs, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities, and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. Capital Resources At September 30, 2012, we had no borrowings against our revolving credit facility, described below, and $1.8 billion in commercial paper outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility.On October 29, 2012, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at 0.9 percent with a maturity date of November 1, 2015 and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes bearing interest at 2.8 percent with a maturity date of November 1, 2022. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually beginning May 1, 2013. The proceeds are being used to pay off commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. In April 2012, we terminated our $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new $2.5 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility matures in April 2017 but allows us to request two one-year extensions. It contains an option to increase the commitment amount by up to an additional $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of any increasing lenders, and includes sub-facilities for swing-line loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate amount of $100 million and $500 million, respectively. Fees on the unused commitment of each lender range from 10 basis points to 25 basis points per year depending on our credit ratings. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (a) an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin ranging from 87.5 basis points to 162.5 basis points per year depending on our credit ratings or (b) the Base Rate plus a margin ranging from 0.0 basis points to 62.5 basis points depending on our credit ratings. Base Rate is defined as a per annum rate equal to the greatest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus one-half of one percent and (c) LIBOR for a one-month interest period plus 1 percent. The agreement contains a covenant that requires our ratio of total debt to total capitalization not to exceed 65 percent as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. If an event of default occurs, the lenders may terminate the commitments under the Credit Facility and require the immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings and the cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit under the Credit Facility.32We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we, as a well-known seasoned issuer, have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate amount of various types of debt and equity securities. Our cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio (total debt-minus-cash to total debt-plus-equity-minus-cash) was 25 percent at September 30, 2012, compared to 20 percent at December 31, 2011.

The increase reflects development plans for the additional acreage acquired in the Eagle Ford shale and other adjustments. Our opinions concerning liquidity and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Estimates may differ from actual results. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors including cash provided from operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The above discussions also contain forward-looking statements about our 2012 capital, investment and exploration budget. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are changes in prices of and demand for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, actions of competitors, disruptions or interruptions of our production and mining operations due to unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response thereto, and other operating and economic considerations.33Contractual Cash Obligations  The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated contractual cash obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of September 30, 2012.     2013- 2015- Later(In millions)Total 2012 2014 2016 YearsShort and long-term debt (excludes interest)$6,504 $1,874 $250 $69 $4,311Lease obligations281 39 80 65 97Purchase obligations:         Oil and gas activities(a)993 351 505 59 78Service and materials contracts(b)909 45 227 131 506Transportation and related contracts1,301 63 317 190 731Drilling rigs and fracturing crews894 139 730 25 —Other234 57 93 27 57Total purchase obligations4,331 655 1,872 432 1,372Other long-term liabilities reported          in the consolidated balance sheet(c)1,122 174 272 253 423Total contractual cash obligations(d)$12,238 $2,742 $2,474 $819 $6,203(a) Oil and gas activities include contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment and commitments for oil and gas exploration such as costs related to contractually obligated exploratory work programs that are expensed immediately.(b) Service and materials contracts include contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.(c) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2021. Also includes amounts for uncertain tax positions.(d) This table does not include the estimated discounted liability for dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of $1,516 million.Environmental Matters We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. There have been no significant changes to our environmental matters subsequent to December 31, 2011.Other ContingenciesWe are defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Litigation – In March 2011, Noble Drilling (U.S.) LLC (“Noble”) filed a lawsuit against us in the District Court of Harris County, Texas alleging, among other things, breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and negligent misrepresentation, relating to a multi-year drilling contract for a newly constructed drilling rig to be deployed in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We filed an answer in April 2011, contending, among other things, failure to perform, failure to comply with material obligations, failure to mitigate alleged damages and that Noble failed to provide the rig according to the operating, performance and safety requirements specified in the drilling contract. Noble is seeking an unspecified amount of damages. We are vigorously defending this litigation. The ultimate outcome of this lawsuit, including any financial effect on us, remains uncertain. We do not believe an estimate of a reasonably probable loss (or range of loss) can be made for this lawsuit at this time.34Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In August 2012, we entered crude oil derivatives related to a portion of our forecast U.S. E&P crude oil sales through December 31, 2013. Disclosures about how derivatives are reported in our consolidated financial statements and how the fair values of our derivative instruments are measured may be found in Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices on our open commodity derivative instruments, by contract type as of September 30, 2012 is provided in the following table.

Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. As of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. In 2012, we began a project to update our existing ERP system. The project includes implementation of a new general ledger, consolidations system and reporting tools. This project is currently in testing phases and we expect full implementation in the first half of 2013.
