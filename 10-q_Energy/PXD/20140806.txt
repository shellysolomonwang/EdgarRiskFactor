Organization and Nature of OperationsPioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer" or the "Company") is a Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production company operating in the United States, with continuing field operations primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas, the Raton field in southeastern Colorado, the Hugoton field in southwest Kansas and the West Panhandle field in the Texas Panhandle. NOTE B. Basis of PresentationPresentation. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of June 30, 2014 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 include all adjustments and accruals, consisting only of normal, recurring accrual adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") have been condensed in or omitted from this report pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). These consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2013 financial statement and footnote amounts in order to conform to the 2014 presentation. New accounting pronouncements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition," and most industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB ASC. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 for public companies. Early adoption is not permitted. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its financial statements or decided upon the method of adoption. In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, "Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity." ASU 2014-08 prospectively changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures around disposals of assets whether or not the disposal meets the definition of a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2014 with early adoption permitted but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.NOTE C. Acquisitions and Divestitures Divestitures Recorded in Continuing OperationsFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company recorded net gains on disposition of assets in continuing operations of $4 million and $10 million, respectively, as compared to $183 million and $207 million for the same respective periods in 2013. The net gains attributable to the disposition of assets were primarily comprised of the following:•Vertical drilling rigs. During December 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell the Company's majority interest in Sendero Drilling Company, LLC ("Sendero") to Sendero's minority interest owner. At December 31, 2013, the assets and liabilities of Sendero were classified as held for sale at their estimated fair value. In March 2014, the Company 10 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2014(Unaudited)completed the sale of Sendero for cash proceeds of $31 million and recognized a gain of $1 million associated with the completion of the sale. As part of the sales agreement, the Company committed to lease from Sendero 12 vertical rigs through December 31, 2015, and eight vertical rigs in 2016.•Permian Basin. During February 2014, the Company completed the sale of proved and unproved properties in Gaines and Dawson counties in the Spraberry field in West Texas for net cash proceeds of $72 million, which resulted in a gain of $2 million on the unproved property. •Southern Wolfcamp. In May 2013, the Company completed the sale of 40 percent of Pioneer's interest in 207,000 net acres leased by the Company in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play in the southern portion of the Spraberry field in West Texas to Sinochem Petroleum USA LLC ("Sinochem") for net cash proceeds of $624 million, which resulted in a gain of $181 million related to the unproved property interests conveyed to Sinochem. Sinochem is paying the remaining $1.2 billion of the transaction price by carrying 75 percent of Pioneer's portion of ongoing drilling and facilities costs attributable to the Company's joint operations with Sinochem in the southern portion of the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play.•West Panhandle. During the first quarter of 2013, the Company completed a sale of its interest in unproved oil and gas properties adjacent to the Company's West Panhandle field operations for net cash proceeds of $38 million, which resulted in a gain of $22 million.Divestitures Recorded as Discontinued OperationsAlaska. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell 100 percent of the capital stock in Pioneer's Alaska subsidiary ("Pioneer Alaska"). In April 2014, the Company completed the sale of Pioneer Alaska to an unaffiliated third party pursuant to an amended purchase and sale agreement for net proceeds of $267 million, including normal closing and other adjustments. The Company has classified Pioneer Alaska's results of operations as income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.Barnett Shale.  During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to divest of its net assets in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In August 2014, the Company signed a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party for $155 million, before normal closing adjustments. Based on the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company expects to close the sale of the Barnett Shale net assets during the third quarter of 2014. The Company has classified its (i) Barnett Shale assets and liabilities as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and (ii) Barnett Shale results of operations as income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Based upon the estimated sales price for the Barnett Shale net assets at June 30, 2014, the Company recorded an additional noncash impairment charge of $114 million in discontinued operations during the three months ended June 30, 2014 to reduce the carrying value of the Barnett Shale net assets to their estimated sales value. See Note D for additional information about the Barnett Shale impairment charge.11 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2014(Unaudited)The following table represents the components of the Company's discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:  Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2014 2013 2014 2013  (in millions)Revenues and other income:        Oil and gas $40 $64 $107 $123Interest and other (a) — 6 29 26Gain on disposition of assets, net  5 8 5 8  45 78 141 157Costs and expenses:        Oil and gas production 11 26 29 46Production and ad valorem taxes 2 3 4 6Depletion, depreciation and amortization — 24 — 43Impairment of oil and gas properties 114 — 225 —Exploration and abandonments 1 5 2 15General and administrative 1 1 3 2Other 4 — 7 —  133 59 270 112Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes (88) 19 (129) 45Current tax provision — (2) (1) (4)Deferred tax (provision) benefit 31 (6) 47 (14)Income (loss) from discontinued operations $(57) $11 $(83) $27 ____________________(a)Primarily comprised of cash received associated with Alaskan Petroleum Production Tax credits on qualifying capital expenditures.

Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based upon inputs that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, which are characterized according to a hierarchy that prioritizes those inputs based on the degree to which they are observable. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources, whereas unobservable inputs reflect a company's own market assumptions, which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort. The three input levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:•Level 1 – quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•Level 2 – quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates) and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.•Level 3 – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  The fair value input hierarchy level to which an asset or liability measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2014 for each of the fair value hierarchy levels:   Fair Value Measurement at the End of theReporting Period Using    Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) Fair Value at June 30, 2014  (in millions)Recurring fair value measurements        Assets:        Commodity derivatives $— $11 $— $11Deferred compensation plan assets 71 — — 71Total assets 71 11 — 82Liabilities:        Commodity derivatives — 164 — 164Total liabilities — 164 — 164Total recurring fair value measurements $71 $(153) $— $(82)Deferred compensation plan assets. The Company's deferred compensation plan assets represent investments in equity and mutual fund securities that are actively traded on major exchanges. These investments are measured based on observable prices on major exchanges. As of June 30, 2014, the significant inputs to these asset values represented Level 1 independent active exchange market price inputs. Commodity derivatives. The Company's commodity derivatives represent oil, natural gas liquids ("NGL") and gas swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts. The asset and liability measurements for the Company's commodity derivative contracts represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow and option-pricing models for valuing its commodity derivatives.The asset and liability values attributable to the Company's commodity derivatives were determined based on inputs that include (i) the contracted notional volumes, (ii) independent active market price quotes, (iii) the applicable estimated credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve and (iv) the implied rate of volatility inherent in the collar and collar contracts with short puts, which is based on active and independent market-quoted volatility factors.13 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2014(Unaudited)Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. These assets and liabilities can include inventory, proved and unproved oil and gas properties that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and assets and liabilities associated with other long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are impaired or held for sale. Assets classified as held for sale.  The Company records assets and liabilities associated with long-lived assets that are classified as held for sale at the lower of the asset's net carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell. At June 30, 2014, the fair value of the Barnett Shale field assets was based upon its estimated sales price, including normal closing adjustments, less costs to sell. Associated therewith, the Company recognized a $114 million impairment charge during the second quarter to reduce the carrying value of the Barnett Shale field assets to their estimated sales price. See Note C for additional information regarding the Company's planned divestiture of its Barnett Shale field assets.At March 31, 2014, the fair value of the Barnett Shale field assets was based upon a probability weighted average calculation that used management inputs including an estimated sales price and a discounted cash flow model for the proved properties using Level 3 assumptions including (i) management's longer-term commodity price outlooks ("Management's Price Outlooks") for oil and gas prices of $81.58 per barrel ("BBL") for oil and $4.64 per million British thermal units ("MMBTU") for gas, and management's outlooks for (ii) production costs, (iii) capital expenditures, (iv) production and (v) estimated proved reserves. Management's Price Outlooks represent longer-term expectations of oil and gas prices that are developed based on third-party futures price outlooks as of a measurement date. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine estimated fair value.At March 31, 2014, the fair value of Pioneer Alaska was based upon an agreed sales price, including normal closing adjustments, less estimated costs to sell. The following table presents each of the fair value adjustments made by the Company during 2014 related to assets that were classified as discontinued operations held for sale:   Estimated Fair Value Less Costs to Sell Fair Value Adjustment   (in millions)Barnett Shale fieldJune 2014 $148 $(114)Barnett Shale fieldMarch 2014 $208 $(14)AlaskaMarch 2014 $253 $(97)Inventories. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $4 million to reduce the carrying value of its excess vertical well pipe inventory. The Company calculated the estimated fair value of the inventory using significant Level 2 assumptions based on third-party price quotes for the asset in an active market. The impairment charge is included in other expense on the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Financial instruments not carried at fair value. Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 are as follows:   June 30, 2014 December 31, 2013  CarryingValue FairValue CarryingValue FairValue  (in millions)Long-term debt $2,659 $3,058 $2,653 $3,019Long-term debt includes the Company's credit facility and the Company's senior notes.

The fair value of the Company's credit facility is calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on (i) forecasted contractual interest and fee payments, (ii) forward active market-quoted United States Treasury Bill rates and (iii) the applicable credit-adjustments.Senior notes. The Company's senior notes represent debt securities that are traded on major exchanges but are not actively traded. The fair values of the Company's senior notes are based on their periodic values as quoted on the major exchanges.The Company has other financial instruments consisting primarily of cash equivalents, receivables, prepaid expenses, payables and other current assets and liabilities that approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and their relatively short maturities. Non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value include certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, goodwill and asset retirement obligations.NOTE E. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. The Company also, from time to time, utilizes interest rate contracts to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company's indebtedness. Oil production derivative activities. All material physical sales contracts governing the Company's oil production are tied directly to, or are highly correlated with, New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices. The Company uses derivative contracts to manage oil price volatility and basis swap contracts to reduce basis risk between NYMEX prices and actual index prices at which the oil is sold.15 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2014(Unaudited)The following table sets forth the volumes per day associated with the Company's outstanding oil derivative contracts as of June 30, 2014 and the weighted average oil prices for those contracts:   Six Months Ending December 31, Year Ending December 31,  2014 2015 2016Collar contracts with short puts:      Volume (BBL) (a)(b) 69,000 95,767 54,000Price per BBL:      Ceiling $114.05 $99.36 $98.36Floor $93.70 $87.98 $85.83Short put $77.61 $73.54 $74.26Swap contracts:      Volume (BBL) 12,500 — —Price per BBL $95.33 $— $—Rollfactor swap contracts:      Volume (BBL) 10,000 5,000 —NYMEX roll price (c) $1.10 $0.60 $— ____________________(a)Counterparties have the option to extend for an additional year 5,000 BBLs per day of 2015 collar contracts with short puts with a ceiling price of $100.08 per BBL, a floor price of $90.00 per BBL and a short put price of $80.00 per BBL.

Prior to termination, the Company received a fixed interest rate of 3.95 percent in exchange for paying a floating interest rate comprised of the three-month LIBOR plus an average rate of 1.11 percent on a notional amount of $400 million.Tabular disclosure of derivative financial instruments. All of the Company's derivatives are accounted for as non-hedge derivatives and therefore all changes in the fair values of its derivative contracts are recognized as gains or losses in the earnings of the periods in which they occur. The Company classifies the fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities as net current or noncurrent derivative assets or net current or noncurrent derivative liabilities, whichever the case may be, by commodity and counterparty. The Company enters into derivatives under master netting arrangements, which, in an event of default, allows the Company to offset payables to and receivables from the defaulting counterparty. 18 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2014(Unaudited)The aggregate fair value of the Company's derivative instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets by type and counterparty, including the classification between current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, consists of the following: Fair Value of Derivative Instruments as of June 30, 2014Type Consolidated Balance SheetLocation FairValue Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Fair Value Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet    (in millions)Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      Asset Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $14 $(13) $1Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $20 $(10) 10        $11Liability Derivatives:     Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $111 $(13) $98Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $76 $(10) 66        $164Fair Value of Derivative Instruments as of December 31, 2013Type Consolidated Balance SheetLocation FairValue Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Fair Value Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet    (in millions)Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      Asset Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $73 $(7) $66Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - current $10 $— 10Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $95 $(4) 91Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $15 $(15) —        $167Liability Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $19 $(7) $12Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $4 $(4) —Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $25 $(15) 10        $22The Company uses credit and other financial criteria to evaluate the credit standing of, and to select, counterparties to its derivative instruments.

The costs are capitalized pending the results of further drilling operations in the area during the second half of 2014. The $43 million of suspended well costs suspended for a period greater than one year at December 31, 2013 related to Pioneer Alaska, which was sold in April 2014. See Note C for additional information on the sale of Pioneer Alaska.NOTE G. Long-term DebtThe Company's long-term debt consists of senior notes and a revolving corporate credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), including the effects of net deferred fair value hedge losses and issuance discounts. The Credit Facility is maintained with a syndicate of financial institutions and has aggregate loan commitments of $1.5 billion that expire in December 2017. As of June 30, 2014, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.NOTE H. Incentive PlansStock-based compensation For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company recorded $33 million and $62 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense for all plans, as compared to $25 million and $53 million for the same respective periods of 2013. As of June 30, 2014, there was $193 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation plan awards, including $58 million attributable to stock-based awards that are expected to be settled on their vesting date in cash, rather than in equity shares ("Liability Awards").

Commitments and ContingenciesThe Company is a party to proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. The Company records reserves for contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.NOTE K. Interest and Other IncomeThe following table provides the components of the Company's interest and other income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:  Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2014 2013 2014 2013  (in millions)Other income $5 $2 $6 $4Equity interest in income of EFS Midstream (a) 3 3 6 6Deferred compensation plan income — — 2 2Loss from vertical integration services (b) (5) (10) (7) (17)Total interest and other income $3 $(5) $7 $(5) ____________________(a)The Company accounts for its investment in EFS Midstream LLC ("EFS Midstream") using the equity method.

NOTE M. Income TaxesThe Company's income tax provisions attributable to income from continuing operations consisted of the following for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:  Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2014 2013 2014 2013  (in millions)Current $6 $7 $18 $14Deferred 28 176 69 219Income tax provision $34 $183 $87 $233For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company's effective tax rates, excluding income attributable to the noncontrolling interest, were 37 percent and 30 percent, respectively, as compared to effective rates of 36 percent for each of the same respective periods in 2013. The Company's 2014 effective tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to state income tax apportionments, nondeductible expenses and, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, the recognition of a $21 million tax benefit resulting from the resolution during the first quarter of 2014 of the tax uncertainty related to net operating loss carryovers and alternative minimum tax credits obtained from the 2012 acquisition of Premier Silica. There are no unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2014.The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service has closed examinations of the 2012 and prior tax years and, with few exceptions, the Company believes that it is no longer subject to examinations by state and foreign tax authorities for years before 2008. As of June 30, 2014, no adjustments had been proposed in any jurisdiction that would have a significant effect on the Company's liquidity, future results of operations or financial position.23 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2014(Unaudited)NOTE N.

NOTE O. Subsequent EventsDivestitures. As discussed in Note C, in August 2014 the Company signed a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party to sell its net assets in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas for $155 million, before normal closing adjustments.In July 2014, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party to sell its net assets in the Hugoton field in southwest Kansas for cash proceeds of $340 million, before normal closing adjustments. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the third quarter of 2014 and is subject to customary closing conditions. Associated with the sale of the Hugoton field, the Company expects to record a pretax noncash loss of approximately $20 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014. The financial and operating results of the Hugoton field activities for the quarter ending September 30, 2014 and all prior periods presented in future filings are expected to be reflected as discontinued operations. No impairment of the net assets of the Hugoton field was recorded as of June 30, 2014 due to (i) the probability-weighted undiscounted cash flows of the Hugoton field net assets exceeding their carrying value at June 30, 2014 and (ii) the uncertainty regarding the willingness of third parties to purchase the Hugoton field net assets on terms and at a price acceptable to the Company, which precluded held for sale criteria as of June 30, 2014.24 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFinancial and Operating PerformanceThe Company's financial and operating performance for the second quarter of 2014 included the following highlights:•Net income attributable to common stockholders for the second quarter of 2014 was $1 million ($0.01 per diluted share), as compared to net income of $337 million ($2.40 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2013. The decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders is comprised of a $268 million decrease in net income from continuing operations and a $68 million decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax. The primary components of the decrease in net income from continuing operations include:•a $362 million increase in net derivative losses, primarily as a result of increases in forward commodity prices and changes in the Company's portfolio of derivatives; •a $179 million decrease in gain on disposition of assets, primarily due to the $181 million gain related to the Company's unproved property interests that were conveyed to Sinochem in the second quarter of 2013; •a $28 million increase in total oil and gas production costs and production and ad valorem taxes, primarily associated with a 12 percent increase in sales volumes;•a $23 million increase in DD&A expense, primarily attributable to a 12 percent increase in sales volumes; •a $16 million increase in general and administrative expense, primarily due to increased personnel, occupancy and information technology costs resulting from the growth in employee headcount in support of the Company's capital expansion initiatives; and•an $11 million increase in exploration and abandonment expense, primarily attributable to the acquisition costs for seismic data covering portions of the Company's Spraberry/Wolfcamp acreage position; partially offset by•a $178 million increase in oil and gas revenues as a result of a 12 percent increase in sales volumes and a 10 percent increase in the average commodity prices received per BOE; and•a $149 million decrease in the Company's income tax provision as a result of the Company's decrease in income from continuing operations before taxes. The primary components of the decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, include:•a $114 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the Company's Barnett Shale field assets to their estimated sales value less costs to sell;•a $33 million decrease in revenues and other income due to the sale of Pioneer Alaska in April 2014; partially offset by•a $24 million decrease in depletion, depreciation and amortization due to the assets of the Barnett Shale field and Pioneer Alaska being classified as held for sale at December 31, 2013;•a $15 million decrease in oil and gas production costs due to the sale of Pioneer Alaska in April 2014; and•a $39 million change in the Company's income taxes attributable to discontinued operations as a result of the loss from discontinued operations before taxes.•During the second quarter of 2014, average daily sales volumes from continuing operations increased by 12 percent to 182,747 BOEPD, as compared to 163,443 BOEPD during the second quarter of 2013. The increase in second quarter 2014 average daily sales volumes, as compared to the second quarter of 2013, is primarily due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford Shale drilling programs.•Average oil, NGL and gas prices increased during the second quarter of 2014 to $95.87 per BBL, $30.65 per BBL and $4.38 per MCF, respectively, as compared to $90.35 per BBL, $28.54 per BBL and $3.76 per MCF, respectively, in the second quarter of 2013. •Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $718 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to $576 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013. The $142 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in sales volumes and commodity prices, partially offset by a decrease in net cash flows from derivative settlements.•As of both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Company's net debt to book capitalization was 25 percent. 25 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYRecent DevelopmentsDivestituresDuring the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to divest of its net assets in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In August 2014 the Company signed a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party for $155 million, before normal closing adjustments. The Company anticipates that the divestiture will close in the third quarter of 2014 and is subject to customary closing conditions.In July 2014, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party to sell its net assets in the Hugoton field in southwest Kansas for cash proceeds of $340 million, before normal closing adjustments. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the third quarter of 2014 and is subject to customary closing conditions. Associated with the sale of the Hugoton field, the Company expects to record a pretax noncash loss of approximately $20 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014. The financial and operating results of the Hugoton field activities for the quarter ending September 30, 2014 and all prior periods presented in future filings are expected to be reflected as discontinued operations. See Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for more information about the sale of the Hugoton field. Third Quarter 2014 OutlookBased on current estimates, the Company expects the following operating and financial results from continuing operations for the quarter ending September 30, 2014:Production is forecasted to average 181,000 to 186,000 BOEPD. Production costs (including production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs) are expected to average $13.50 to $15.50 per BOE based on current NYMEX strip commodity prices. DD&A expense is expected to average $14.00 to $16.00 per BOE.Total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $25 million to $35 million. General and administrative expense is expected to be $80 million to $85 million. Interest expense is expected to be $47 million to $52 million, and other expense is expected to be $25 million to $35 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $3 million to $5 million.The Company's effective income tax rate is expected to range from 35 percent to 40 percent assuming current capital spending plans and no significant mark-to-market changes in the Company's derivative position. Cash income taxes are expected to range from $10 million to $15 million and are primarily attributable to federal alternative minimum tax and state taxes.Operations and Drilling HighlightsThe following table summarizes the Company's average daily oil, NGL, gas and total production by asset area during the six months ended June 30, 2014:  Oil (BBLs) NGLs (BBLs) Gas (MCF) Total (BOE)Permian Basin 58,153 18,619 78,457 89,849South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale 17,228 12,915 86,714 44,595Raton Basin — — 125,762 20,960Mid-Continent 3,010 7,003 38,593 16,445South Texas - Other 792 9 28,230 5,506Other 5 2 79 20 Total continuing operations 79,188 38,548 357,835 177,375Barnett Shale 2,138 3,639 27,097 10,293Alaska 2,018 — — 2,018 Total including discontinued operations 83,344 42,187 384,932 189,686During 2014 and 2013, the Company has focused its capital budgets and expenditures on oil and liquids-rich gas drilling activities due to relatively lower gas prices. As a result of these capital activities, the Company's total liquids production from continuing operations increased to 66 percent of total production, on a BOE basis, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to 62 percent for the same period last year. The Company's liquids revenue as a percent of total commodity sales was 26 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY84 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to 85 percent for the same period last year, due to a 32 percent increase in the average gas price relative to increases of six percent and eight percent in the average oil and NGL prices, respectively.

The Company successfully completed 202 wells in the Permian Basin area during the first six months of 2014. During 2014, the Company expects to place on production approximately 200 vertical wells and to drill approximately 255 horizontal wells, with the horizontal wells being drilled in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp Shale horizons. The Company expects to spend $2.4 billion of drilling capital in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area during 2014.The Company believes it has significant resource potential within its acreage based on its extensive geologic data covering the Spraberry and Wolfcamp A, B, C and D intervals and its drilling results to-date. During 2014, the Company expects to drill 130 horizontal wells in the northern portion of the play and 125 horizontal wells in the southern portion of the play, where the Company has its joint venture with Sinochem. The wells in these areas are expected to be drilled on multiple-well pads to gain 27 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYefficiencies; therefore, the wells will not be completed until after the last well on each pad is drilled and, accordingly, production from these wells is not expected until all wells on the pad are ready to produce. With the addition of drilling rigs during the first half of 2014, combined with the effects of pad drilling, the Company continues to expect production growth to be weighted towards the second half of 2014. The Company continues to drill vertically to deeper intervals in the Spraberry field below the Wolfcamp interval, including the Strawn and Atoka intervals. The Company is reducing its vertical drilling activity from 11 rigs to nine rigs during the second half of 2014, with further reductions expected in 2015. The Company expects to place on production approximately 200 vertical wells that are predominately targeting deeper intervals during 2014. These wells are being drilled to meet continuous drilling obligations.The Company continues to benefit from its integrated services to control well costs and operating costs in addition to supporting the execution of its drilling and production activities in the Spraberry field. The Company is currently utilizing six Company-owned fracture stimulation fleets totaling approximately 250,000 horsepower in the Spraberry field. To support its operations, the Company also owns other field service equipment, including pulling units, fracture stimulation tanks, water transport trucks, hot oilers, blowout preventers, construction equipment and fishing tools. In addition, Premier Silica (the Company's wholly-owned sand mining subsidiary) is supplying brown sand for proppant, which is being used by the Company to fracture stimulate vertical and horizontal wells in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp Shale intervals.During April 2014, the Company extended its gas processing agreement with Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. ("Atlas") for an additional 10 years (through 2032) to help ensure adequate gas processing capacity across the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area as the Company increases its drilling activities. Associated with the agreement, Atlas is adding 400 million cubic feet per day of new processing capacity by the second half of 2015, with half of the new capacity coming online during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the other half coming online during the second half of 2015. The Company owns a 27 percent interest in the Atlas gas processing facilities and will fund its share of capital to build these new facilities.Eagle Ford Shale area. The Company's drilling activities in the South Texas area during 2014 continue to be primarily focused on delineation and development of Pioneer's substantial acreage position in the Eagle Ford Shale play. The 2014 drilling program has been focused on liquids-rich drilling, with no wells planned to be drilled in dry gas acreage. The Company completed 57 horizontal Eagle Ford Shale wells during the first six months of 2014, all of which were successful, with average lateral lengths of approximately 5,500 feet and, on average, 19-stage fracture stimulations. Of the 57 Eagle Ford Shale wells that were placed on production during the first six months of 2014, the Company placed 17 Upper Eagle Ford interval wells on production and estimates that approximately 25 percent of the Company's acreage is prospective for this interval in the Eagle Ford Shale play. The Company plans to spend $545 million of drilling capital in 2014 to drill approximately 125 Eagle Ford Shale wells. The Company is operating two Pioneer-owned fracture stimulation fleets in the play and supplements with third-party fleets as needed.In 2013, the Company added approximately 300 drilling locations in the liquids-rich area of the play as a result of downspacing from 1,000 feet between wells (120-acre spacing) to 500 feet (60-acre spacing) between wells. Further downspacing and staggered testing to 175 feet between wells is underway in the liquids-rich areas where the 500-foot spacing was successful. Some areas will include testing of the Lower Eagle Ford Shale only, while others will include a combination of the Lower and Upper Eagle Ford interval tests. Early results from the initial downspacing and staggered tests in the Eagle Ford Shale continue to be encouraging.The Company's drilling operations in the Eagle Ford Shale continue to focus on improving drilling efficiencies. In 2014, most Eagle Ford Shale wells will be drilled utilizing three-well and four-well pads, which are not completed until after the last well on the pad is drilled and, accordingly, production from these wells is not expected until all wells on the pad are ready to produce. Pad drilling saves the Company a significant amount of capital costs per well, as compared to drilling single-well locations. The Company has also been using lower-cost white sand instead of ceramic proppant to fracture stimulate wells drilled in all active development areas, including deeper areas of the field. Well performance continues to be similar to direct offset ceramic-stimulated wells. The Company is continuing to monitor the performance of these wells.During the second quarter of 2014, the Company received confirmation from the U.S. Department of Commerce that condensate processed through distillation units such as those located at several of Pioneer's Eagle Ford Shale central gathering plants in South Texas is a petroleum product that may be exported without a license.Barnett Shale. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to divest of its net assets in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In August 2014, the Company signed a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party for $155 million, before normal closing adjustments. The Company classified the Barnett Shale field assets and liabilities as held for sale in the Company's accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Results of 28 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYoperations from the Company's Barnett Shale field are reported as discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations.See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information about the Company's divestiture of its Barnett Shale assets.Alaska. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell 100 percent of the capital stock in Pioneer Alaska. In April 2014, the Company completed the sale of Pioneer Alaska to an unaffiliated third party pursuant to an amended purchase and sale agreement. Pioneer Alaska's results of operations are reported as discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations.See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information about the Company's divestiture of Pioneer Alaska.Results of Operations from Continuing OperationsOil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues totaled $959 million and $1.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to $781 million and $1.5 billion for the same respective periods in 2013. The increase in oil and gas revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, reflected 15 percent and 32 percent increases in daily oil and NGL sales volumes, respectively, and six percent, seven percent and 16 percent increases in average oil, NGL and gas prices, respectively. Partially offsetting the effects of these increases was a two percent decline in gas sales volumes. The increase in oil and gas revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, reflected 15 percent and 26 percent increases in daily oil and NGL sales volumes, respectively, and six percent, eight percent and 32 percent increases in average oil, NGL and gas prices, respectively. Partially offsetting the effects of these increases was a three percent decline in gas sales volumes. The following table provides average daily sales volumes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:   Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2014 2013 2014 2013Oil (BBLs) 79,780 69,501 79,188 69,145NGLs (BBLs) 41,302 31,231 38,548 30,595Gas (MCF) 369,987 376,267 357,835 368,018Total (BOEs) 182,747 163,443 177,375 161,076Average daily BOE sales volumes increased by 12 percent and 10 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods in 2013, principally due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford Shale drilling programs. The oil, NGL and gas prices that the Company reports are based on the market prices received for each commodity. The following table provides the Company's average prices for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:   Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2014 2013 2014 2013Oil (per BBL) $95.87 $90.35 $94.15 $89.03NGL (per BBL) $30.65 $28.54 $31.91 $29.67Gas (per MCF) $4.38 $3.76 $4.58 $3.47Total (per BOE) $57.64 $52.52 $58.21 $51.78Sales of purchased oil and gas. The Company periodically enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure available oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company’s areas of production. The Company enters into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to satisfy unused pipeline capacity commitments and to diversify a portion of the Company's WTI oil sales to a Gulf Coast oil price. Revenues and expenses from these transactions are presented on a gross basis as the Company acts as a principal in the transaction by assuming the risk and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, of the commodities purchased and assuming responsibility to deliver the commodities sold. Deficiency payments on excess pipeline capacity commitments are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements 29 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYof operations. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for further information on transportation commitment charges. Interest and other income.  Interest and other income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 was $3 million and $7 million, respectively, as compared to a loss of $5 million for each of the same respective periods in 2013. The increases in interest and other income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same respective periods in 2013, are primarily due to a decrease of $5 million and $10 million, respectively, in the net loss from vertical integration services between the periods. See Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information.Derivative gains (losses), net. The Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces, sells and consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company recorded $218 million and $322 million of net derivative losses on commodity price and interest rate derivatives, of which $6 million and $24 million, respectively, represented net cash payments. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the Company recorded $144 million and $102 million of net derivative gains, which included $34 million and $88 million, respectively, of cash receipts. Derivative gains and losses result from changes in the fair values of the Company's derivative contracts. See Notes D and E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information regarding the Company's derivative activities and market risks associated with those activities. Gain on disposition of assets, net. The Company recorded net gains on the disposition of assets of $4 million and $10 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to $183 million and $207 million for the same respective periods in 2013. The net gain for the six months ended June 30, 2014 included the Company's February 2014 sale of proved and unproved properties in Gaines and Dawson counties in the Spraberry field in West Texas for net cash proceeds of $72 million, which resulted in a gain of $2 million on the unproved properties. The Company also recognized a $1 million gain during the first quarter of 2014 associated with the sale of Sendero.The net gain for the three months ended June 30, 2013 is primarily associated with the sale of a 40 percent interest in the Company's horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play in the southern portion of the Spraberry field in West Texas for net cash proceeds of $624 million, which resulted in a gain of $181 million related to the unproved property interests conveyed to Sinochem. The net gain for the six months ended June 30, 2013 also included the sale of the Company's interest in unproved oil and gas properties adjacent to the Company's West Panhandle field operations for net cash proceeds of $38 million, which resulted in a gain of $22 million. See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the Company's gains and losses on the disposition of assets.Oil and gas production costs. The Company recorded oil and gas production costs of $173 million and $338 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to $153 million and $303 million during the same respective periods in 2013. Lease operating expenses and workover costs represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while third-party transportation charges represent the cost to transport volumes produced to a sales point. Net natural gas plant charges represent the net costs to gather and process the Company's gas, reduced by net revenues earned from the gathering and processing of third-party gas in Company-owned facilities.Total oil and gas production costs per BOE for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 increased by one percent as compared to the same respective periods in 2013. The increase in production costs per BOE during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same respective periods in 2013, is primarily reflective of increases in (i) lease operating expenses and (ii) third-party transportation charges, partially offset by decreases in (i) net natural gas plant charges resulting from increased gathering and processing revenues from processing third-party gas in Company-owned facilities and (ii) workover expenses, primarily related to reduced activity levels. 30 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY The following table provides the components of the Company's oil and gas production costs per BOE for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:   Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2014 2013 2014 2013Lease operating expenses $8.15 $7.62 $8.22 $7.65Third-party transportation charges 1.86 1.56 1.76 1.61Net natural gas plant charges (0.16) 0.16 (0.10) 0.20Workover costs 0.57 0.99 0.65 0.93Total production costs $10.42 $10.33 $10.53 $10.39Production and ad valorem taxes. The Company's production and ad valorem taxes were $59 million and $116 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to $51 million and $103 million for the same respective periods in 2013. In general, production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, Texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. The following table provides the Company's production and ad valorem taxes per BOE for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:   Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2014 2013 2014 2013Production taxes 2.24 2.13 $2.28 $2.17Ad valorem taxes $1.30 $1.31 1.33 1.35Total production and ad valorem taxes $3.54 $3.44 $3.61$3.52Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company's DD&A expense was $248 million ($14.90 per BOE) and $469 million ($14.60 per BOE) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to $225 million ($15.17 per BOE) and $437 million ($15.00 per BOE) during the same respective periods in 2013. The decrease in per BOE DD&A expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same periods in 2013, is primarily due to the change in depletion expense.Depletion expense on oil and gas properties was $14.35 and $14.04 per BOE during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to $14.50 and $14.33 per BOE during the same respective periods in 2013. The one percent and two percent decreases in per BOE depletion expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same respective periods in 2013, are primarily due to the impairment of proved properties in the Raton field during the fourth quarter of 2013, which reduced the Raton field's carrying value by $1.5 billion, partially offset by negative revisions of previous estimates during the fourth quarter of 2013 to remove undeveloped vertical well locations that were no longer expected to be drilled as the Company shifted its planned capital expenditures to higher-rate-of-return horizontal drilling.Impairment of oil and gas properties. The Company performs assessments of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to its properties may change in the future resulting in the need to impair their carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows are (i) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (ii) results of future drilling activities, (iii) Management's Price Outlooks and (iv) increases or decreases in production and capital costs associated with these fields.31 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYExploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the Company's geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes expense and lease abandonments and other exploration expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):   Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2014 2013 2014 2013Geological and geophysical $26 $17 $50 $35Exploratory dry holes 3 — 4 —Leasehold abandonments and other — 1 6 1  $29 $18 $60 $36The Company's geological and geophysical costs increased by $9 million and $15 million, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same respective periods in 2013, primarily due to increased seismic and seismic interpretation expenditures supportive of drilling activities in the Spraberry field. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company drilled and evaluated 129 exploration/extension wells, 128 of which were successfully completed as discoveries. During the same period in 2013, the Company drilled and evaluated 113 exploration/extension wells, 107 of which were successfully completed as discoveries.General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 was $82 million and $163 million, respectively, as compared to $66 million and $128 million for the same respective periods in 2013. The increases in general and administrative expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same respective periods in 2013, are primarily due to increases in expenses related to personnel, occupancy and information technology in support of the Company's capital expansion initiatives. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations was $3 million and $6 million for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for information regarding the Company's asset retirement obligations. Interest expense. Interest expense was $47 million and $92 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to $43 million and $94 million during the same respective periods in 2013. The weighted average interest rate on the Company's indebtedness for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, including the effects of capitalized interest, were 6.4 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, as compared to 6.1 percent and 6.0 percent for the same respective periods in 2013. The $4 million increase in interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2013, is primarily due to the reduction in capitalized interest associated with the Company's Alaska development project that was sold in April 2014. The $2 million decrease in interest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2013, is primarily due to a reduction in aggregate debt as a result of the repayment of amounts outstanding under Pioneer Southwest's credit facility in December 2013 and conversions of the Company's convertible senior notes in April 2013, partially offset by the reduction in capitalized interest expense during the second quarter of 2014 due to the sale of Pioneer Alaska in April 2014.Other expense. Other expense was $22 million and $38 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to $22 million and $42 million during the same respective periods in 2013. The decrease in other expense for the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, is primarily due to an $8 million decrease in above market and idle drilling and well service equipment charges, partially offset by a $4 million increase in transportation commitment charges. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information.Income tax provision. The Company recorded income tax provisions from continuing operations of $34 million and $87 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to $183 million and $233 million during the same respective periods in 2013. The Company's effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 were 37 percent and 30 percent, respectively, as compared to 36 percent for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2013. The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent during the six months ended June 30, 2014 is primarily due to the recognition of a $21 million tax benefit related to net operating loss carryovers and alternative minimum tax credits obtained from the 2012 acquisition of Premier Silica. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.Income/loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company reported losses from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $57 million and $83 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, as compared to income from 32 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYdiscontinued operations, net of tax, of $11 million and $27 million for the same respective periods in 2013. The decreases in earnings from discontinued operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same respective periods in 2013, are primarily due to (i) the $114 million and $225 million impairment charges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively, to reduce the carrying values of the Company's Barnett Shale field assets and Pioneer Alaska to their estimated sales values less costs to sell. The impairment charges were partially offset by a reduction in DD&A for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 due to the Barnett Shale field assets and Pioneer Alaska being classified as held for sale at December 31, 2013. See Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for specific information regarding the Company's discontinued operations.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 was nominal, as compared to $14 million and $22 million for the same respective periods in 2013. The decreases in income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same respective periods in 2013, are due to the Company's acquisition of all of the outstanding common units of Pioneer Southwest not owned by the Company in December 2013. The portion of income from noncontrolling interest for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 related to Pioneer Southwest was $14 million and $22 million, respectively. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and LiquidityCapital commitments. The Company's primary needs for cash are for capital expenditures and acquisition expenditures on oil and gas properties and related vertical integration assets and facilities, payment of contractual obligations, dividends and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, cash and cash equivalents on hand, proceeds from the divestiture of assets held for sale, proceeds from the sales of other nonstrategic assets or external financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" below.The Company's capital budget for 2014 is focused on oil and liquids-rich gas drilling activities with total planned expenditures of $3.3 billion (excluding acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs and capital expenditures associated with Pioneer Alaska and Barnett Shale field assets prior to their sale), consisting of $3.0 billion for drilling operations, including budgeted land capital for existing assets, and $285 million for buildings, vertical integration and other plant and equipment additions. Based on results for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and Management's Price Outlook, the Company expects its cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, proceeds from the divestiture of assets held for sale, proceeds from other nonstrategic assets sales and, if necessary, availability under its Credit Facility to be sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the remainder of 2014.Investing activities. Investing activities used $1.1 billion of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to $814 million of cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2013. The $289 million increase in cash used in investing activities for the six months ending June 30, 2014, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2013, is primarily due to a $306 million decrease in proceeds from the disposition of assets. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company's expenditures for investing activities were primarily funded by net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from disposition of assets.Dividends/distributions. During February of both 2014 and 2013, the Board declared semiannual dividends of $0.04 per common share. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, and, if declared, the Board may change the current dividend amount based on the Company's liquidity and capital resources at the time.During January 2013 and April 2013, the Pioneer Southwest board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.52 per limited partner unit. Associated therewith, Pioneer Southwest paid aggregate distributions to noncontrolling unitholders of $18 million during the six months ended June 30, 2013. Contractual obligations, including off-balance sheet obligations. The Company's contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments (including commitments to pay day rates for drilling rigs), capital funding obligations, derivative obligations, firm transportation and fractionation commitments, minimum annual gathering, treating and transportation commitments and other liabilities (including postretirement benefit obligations). From time-to-time, the Company enters into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of June 30, 2014, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company has entered into include (i) operating lease agreements, (ii) drilling commitments, (iii) firm transportation and fractionation commitments, (iv) open purchase commitments and (v) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable, such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices or interest rates and gathering, treating, fractionation and transportation commitments on uncertain volumes of future throughput, open delivery commitments and indemnification obligations following certain divestitures. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no 33 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYtransactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other parties that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. Since December 31, 2013, the primary change in the Company's contractual obligations is a $298 million decrease in the fair value of the Company's derivative contracts. The Company's commodity and interest rate derivative contracts are periodically measured and recorded at fair value and continue to be subject to market or credit risk. As of June 30, 2014, these contracts represented net liabilities of $153 million. The ultimate liquidation value of the Company's commodity and interest rate derivatives will be dependent upon actual future commodity prices and interest rates, which may differ materially from the inputs used to determine the derivatives' fair values as of June 30, 2014. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information about the Company's derivative instruments and market risk.Capital resources. The Company's primary capital resources are cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the divestiture of assets held for sale, proceeds from sales of other nonstrategic assets and proceeds from financing activities (principally borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility or issuances of debt or equity securities). If internal cash flows and cash on hand do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may reduce its level of capital expenditures, and/or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using availability under its Credit Facility, issue debt or equity securities or obtain capital from other sources, such as through the sale of nonstrategic assets.Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $1.2 billion, as compared to $937 million during the same period in 2013. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2013, is primarily due to an increase in oil, NGL and gas sales volumes as a result of the Company's successful drilling program and higher realized commodity prices, partially offset by a decrease in net cash flows from derivative settlements.Asset divestitures.  During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company completed the sale of (i) Pioneer Alaska for cash proceeds of $267 million, (ii) Sendero for cash proceeds of $31 million (Sendero had $14 million of cash on hand at the time of the sale) and (iii) proved and unproved properties in Gaines and Dawson counties in the Spraberry field in West Texas for net cash proceeds of $72 million.  During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to divest of its net assets in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. In August 2014, the Company signed a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party for $155 million, before normal closing adjustments. Based on the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company expects to close the sale of the Barnett Shale net assets during the third quarter of 2014. The Company has classified Barnett Shale assets and liabilities as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 and has reported Barnett Shale historical results of operations, and the related impairment loss, as discontinued operations, net of tax, in the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations.In July 2014, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with an unaffiliated third party to sell its net assets in the Hugoton field in southwest Kansas for cash proceeds of $340 million, before normal closing adjustments. Closing of the transaction is expected to occur during the third quarter of 2014 and is subject to customary closing conditions. In January 2013, the Company signed an agreement with Sinochem, an unaffiliated third party, to sell 40 percent of Pioneer's interest in 207,000 net acres leased by the Company in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play in the southern portion of the Spraberry field for total consideration of $1.8 billion, including normal closing adjustments. In May 2013, the Company completed the sale to Sinochem for net cash proceeds of $624 million. Sinochem is paying the remaining $1.2 billion of the transaction price by carrying 75 percent of Pioneer's portion of ongoing drilling and facilities costs attributable to the Company's joint operations with Sinochem in the southern portion of the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play. Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $28 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $344 million during the same period in 2013. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same period of 2013, is primarily the result of a decrease of $1.3 billion of realized net proceeds from the Company's completion of an offering of its common stock in February 2013, partially offset by (i) a decrease in net principal payments on long-term debt of $904 million and (ii) a decrease of $18 million in distributions to noncontrolling interests.As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The Company cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of any such actions as they are subject to market conditions, among other factors. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class 34 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYpreferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Board. Liquidity. The Company's principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2014, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its Credit Facility, leaving $1.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of June 30, 2014. The Company also had cash on hand of $445 million as of June 30, 2014. If internal cash flows and cash on hand do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may reduce its level of capital expenditures, reduce dividend payments, and/or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using borrowings under its Credit Facility, issuances of debt or equity securities or other sources, such as the sale of nonstrategic assets. The Company cannot provide any assurance that needed short-term or long-term liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Although the Company expects that internal operating cash flows, cash on hand, proceeds from the divestiture of assets held for sale, proceeds from the sales of other nonstrategic assets and, if necessary, available capacity under the Company's Credit Facility will be adequate to fund 2014 capital expenditures, dividend payments and provide adequate liquidity to fund other needs, no assurances can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Company's future needs.Debt ratings. The Company is rated as investment grade by three credit rating agencies. The Company receives debt credit ratings from several of the major ratings agencies, which are subject to regular reviews. The Company believes that each of the rating agencies considers many factors in determining the Company's ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels, asset composition and proved reserve mix. A reduction in the Company's debt ratings could increase the interest rates that the Company incurs on Credit Facility borrowings and could negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. Book capitalization and current ratio. The Company's net book capitalization at June 30, 2014 was $9.0 billion, consisting of $445 million of cash and cash equivalents, debt of $2.7 billion and equity of $6.7 billion. The Company's net debt to net book capitalization was 25 percent at both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The Company's ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to 0.94 to 1.00 at June 30, 2014, as compared to 1.38 to 1.00 at December 31, 2013, primarily due to a decrease in assets held for sale due to the sale of Pioneer Alaska in April 2014 and an increase in net derivative liabilities. New accounting pronouncements. The effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item1. Financial Statements".35 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe following quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are supplementary to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures provided in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. As such, the information contained herein should be read in conjunction with the related disclosures in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company's potential exposure to market risks. The term "market risks," insofar as it relates to currently anticipated transactions of the Company, refers to the risk of loss arising from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. These disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators regarding how the Company views and manages ongoing market risk exposures. None of the Company's market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for speculative purposes.The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Company's open derivative contracts during the six months ending June 30, 2014:  Derivative Contract Net Assets  Commodities Interest Rates Total  (in millions)Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2013 $145 $— $145Changes in contract fair value (340) 18 (322)Contract maturity payments (receipts) 40 (4) 36Contract terminations payments (receipts) 2 (14) (12)Fair value of contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2014 $(153) $— $(153)Interest rate sensitivity. See Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity included in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information regarding the Company's long-term debt.36 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe following table provides information about financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of June 30, 2014 and that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents debt maturities by expected maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given current contractual terms and market conditions and the debt's estimated fair value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of June 30, 2014. The Company had no outstanding variable rate debt as of June 30, 2014, but presents for the reader's information the average variable contractual rates for its credit facility projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on August 1, 2014.

The following table provides information about the Company's oil, NGL and gas derivative financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil, NGL and gas prices as of June 30, 2014. Although mitigated by the Company's derivative activities, declines in oil, NGL and gas prices would reduce the Company's revenues.The Company manages commodity price risk with derivative contracts, such as swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short put options. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide minimum ("floor" or "long put") and maximum ("ceiling") prices on a notional amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price. Collar contracts with short put options differ from other collar contracts by virtue of the short put option price, below which the Company's realized price will exceed the variable market prices by the long put-to-short put price differential.See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for a description of the accounting procedures followed by the Company relative to its derivative financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of the Company's derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil, NGL or gas prices.37 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY  Six Months Ending December 31, Year Ending December 31, Asset (Liability) Fair Value at June 30,  2014 2015 2016 2014 (a)        (in millions)Oil Derivatives:        Average daily notional BBL volumes:        Collar contracts with short puts (b)(c) 69,000 95,767 54,000 $(130)Weighted average ceiling price per BBL $114.05 $99.36 $98.36  Weighted average floor price per BBL $93.70 $87.98 $85.83  Weighted average short put price per BBL $77.61 $73.54 $74.26  Swap contracts 12,500 — — $(17)Weighted average fixed price per BBL $95.33 $— $—  Average forward NYMEX oil prices (d) $96.73 $93.26 $90.10  Rollfactor swap contracts (e) 10,000 5,000 — $—Weighted average fixed price per BBL $1.10 $0.60 $—  Average forward rollfactor prices (d) $0.80 $0.45 $—  NGL Derivatives:        Average daily notional BBL volumes:        Collar contracts with short puts (f) 3,500 — — $(1)Weighted average ceiling price per BBL $97.93 $— $—  Weighted average floor price per BBL $90.14 $— $—  Weighted average short put price per BBL $81.36 $— $—  Average forward NGL prices (g) $87.61 $— $—  Collar contracts (h) 3,000 — — $—Weighted average ceiling price per BBL $13.72 $— $—  Weighted average floor price per BBL $10.78 $— $—  Average forward NGL prices (g) $10.21 $— $—  Swap contracts (i) 2,337 — — $1Weighted average fixed price per BBL $48.11 $— $—  Average forward NGL prices (g) $43.38 $— $—  Gas Derivatives:        Average daily notional MMBTU volumes:        Collar contracts with short puts 115,000 285,000 20,000 $9Weighted average ceiling price per MMBTU $4.70 $5.07 $5.36  Weighted average floor price per MMBTU $4.00 $4.00 $4.00  Weighted average short put price per MMBTU $3.00 $3.00 $3.00  Swap contracts 195,000 20,000 — $(14)Weighted average fixed price per MMBTU $4.04 $4.31 $—  Average forward NYMEX gas prices (d) $3.87 $3.87 $4.03  Basis swap contracts (j) 130,000 90,000 — $(1)Weighted average fixed price per MMBTU $(0.21) $(0.22) $—  Average forward basis differential prices (k) $(0.13) $(0.22) $—   ___________________(a)In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 210-20 and ASC 815-10, the Company classifies the fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities executed under master netting arrangements as net derivative assets or net derivative liabilities, as the case may be.

Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Company's management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 40 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYPART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings  The Company is party to various proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations.
