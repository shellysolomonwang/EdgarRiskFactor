Item 1A. Risk Factors  In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings “Item 1. Business – Competition, Markets and Regulations,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” which risks could materially affect the Company’s business, financial condition or future results. Except as stated below and as set forth in Item 1A of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, there has been no material change in the Company’s risk factors from those described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.  President Obama’s Proposed Fiscal Year 2010 Budget includes proposed legislation that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.  The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, NGLs and gas the Company produces.  On June 26, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives approved adoption of the “American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009,” (“ACESA”) or also known as the “Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade legislation”. The purpose of ACESA is to control and reduce emissions of “greenhouse gases,” such as carbon dioxide and methane, in the United States. ACESA would establish an economy-wide cap on emissions of greenhouse gases, or “GHGs,” in the United States and would require an overall reduction in GHG emissions of 17% (from 2005 levels) by 2020, and by over 80% by 2050. Under ACESA, most sources of GHG emissions would be required to obtain GHG emission “allowances” corresponding to their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of emission allowances issued each year would decline as necessary to meet ACESA’s overall emission reduction goals. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. The net effect of ACESA will be to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon-based fuels such as oil, refined petroleum products, and gas. The U.S. Senate has begun work on its own legislation for controlling and reducing emissions of GHGs in the United States. If the Senate adopts GHG legislation that is different from ACESA, the Senate legislation would need to be reconciled with ACESA and both chambers would be required to approve identical legislation before it could become law.  It is not possible at this time to predict whether climate change legislation will be enacted, but any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of GHGs would likely require the Company to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil, NGLs and gas it produces.    65    Table of Contents PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY    The adoption of derivatives legislation by Congress could have an adverse impact on the Company’s ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price risk associated with its business.  Congress is currently considering legislation to impose restrictions on certain transactions involving derivatives. The legislation would expand the power of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, (“CFTC”) to regulate derivative transactions related to energy commodities, including oil, NGLs and gas, until the adoption of general legislation covering derivative regulatory reform. The CFTC recently conducted hearings to determine whether to set limits on trading and positions in commodities with finite supply, particularly energy commodities, such as oil, NGLs, gas and other energy products. In addition, the Treasury Department recently has indicated that it intends to propose legislation to subject all over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative dealers and all other major OTC derivative market participants to substantial supervision and regulation, including by imposing conservative capital and margin requirements and strong business conduct standards. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the CFTC may adopt rules or Congress may act on derivatives legislation, any laws or regulations that may be adopted could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to utilize derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price risk associated with its business.  Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.  Congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Sponsors of bills currently pending before the Senate and House of Representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies. In addition, these bills, if adopted, could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase the Company’s costs of compliance and doing business.
