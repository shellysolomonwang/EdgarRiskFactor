Organization and Nature of OperationsPioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer" or the "Company") is a Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production company operating in the United States, with operations primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas, the Raton field in southeast Colorado and the West Panhandle field in the Texas Panhandle.NOTE B. Basis of PresentationPresentation. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of March 31, 2016 and for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 include all adjustments and accruals, consisting only of normal, recurring accrual adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") have been condensed in or omitted from this report pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). These consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial statement and footnote amounts in order to conform to the 2016 presentation. Restructuring. In February 2016, the Company announced plans to restructure its pressure pumping operations in South Texas, including relocating its two Eagle Ford Shale pressure pumping fleets to the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area. In connection therewith, the Company offered severance to certain employees and relocated a number of other employees from its South Texas locations to its operations in the Permian Basin. This initiative is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 2016. In connection therewith, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recognized $3 million of restructuring charges in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company estimates that it will incur an additional $2 million of restructuring charges related thereto during the remainder of 2016. The aggregate $5 million of estimated restructuring charges includes approximately $3 million in cash employee severance costs and $2 million in employee relocation and other costs. In May 2015, the Company announced plans to restructure its operations in Colorado, including closing its office in Denver, Colorado and eliminating its Trinidad-based pressure pumping operations. The restructuring plan was substantially complete as of December 31, 2015. As of March 31, 2016, the Company had $5 million of restructuring liabilities recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, primarily related to employee severance costs associated with the South Texas restructuring and future lease obligations associated with its Denver, Colorado office. Issuance of common stock. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company issued 13.8 million shares of common stock and received cash proceeds of $1.6 billion, net of associated underwriting and offering expenses. New accounting pronouncements. In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as certain classification changes in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases." ASU 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases and makes certain changes to the way lease expenses 10 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2016(Unaudited)are accounted for. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods beginning the following year. This update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." ASU 2016-01 changes certain guidance related to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted for the majority of the update, but is permitted for two of its provisions. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition," and most industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year to annual reports beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt the new standards. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements or decided upon its method of adoption.NOTE C. Divestitures EFS Midstream. In July 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its 50.1 percent equity interest in EFS Midstream LLC ("EFS Midstream") to an unaffiliated third party, with the Company receiving total consideration of $1.0 billion, of which $530 million was received at closing and the remaining approximately $500 million will be received in July 2016. The amount to be received in July 2016, less imputed interest, is included in notes receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. NOTE D. Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based upon inputs that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, which are characterized according to a hierarchy that prioritizes those inputs based on the degree to which they are observable. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources, whereas unobservable inputs reflect a company's own market assumptions, which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort. The three input levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:•Level 1 – quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•Level 2 – quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates) and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.•Level 3 – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.11 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2016(Unaudited)Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value input hierarchy level to which an asset or liability measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2016 for each of the fair value hierarchy levels:   Fair Value Measurement at March 31, 2016 Using    Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) Fair Value at March 31, 2016  (in millions)Assets:        Commodity derivatives $— $590 $— $590Deferred compensation plan assets 75 — — 75Total assets 75 590 — 665Liabilities:        Commodity derivatives — 6 — 6Interest rate derivatives — 2 — 2Total liabilities — 8 — 8Total recurring fair value measurements $75 $582 $— $657Commodity derivatives. The Company's commodity derivatives represent oil, natural gas liquids ("NGL") and gas swap contracts and collar contracts with short puts. The asset and liability measurements for the Company's commodity derivative contracts represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow and option-pricing models for valuing its commodity derivatives.The asset and liability values attributable to the Company's commodity derivatives were determined based on inputs that include (i) the contracted notional volumes, (ii) independent active market price quotes, (iii) the applicable estimated credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve and (iv) the implied rate of volatility inherent in the collar contracts with short puts, which is based on active and independent market-quoted volatility factors.Deferred compensation plan assets. The Company's deferred compensation plan assets represent investments in equity and mutual fund securities that are actively traded on major exchanges. These investments are measured based on observable prices on major exchanges. As of March 31, 2016, the significant inputs to these asset values represented Level 1 independent active exchange market price inputs. Interest rate derivatives. The Company's interest rate derivative liabilities represent interest rate swap contracts. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow models for valuing its interest rate derivatives. The net derivative values attributable to the Company's interest rate derivative contracts are based on (i) the contracted notional amounts, (ii) forward active market-quoted London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and (iii) the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve. The Company's interest rate derivative fair value measurements represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. These assets and liabilities can include inventory, proved and unproved oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired or held for sale. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded charges in other expense in the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations of $4 million to reduce the carrying value of certain inventory and other property and equipment to fair value. 12 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2016(Unaudited)Proved oil and gas properties. As a result of the Company's proved property impairment assessments, the Company recognized pretax, noncash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of (i) its West Panhandle field during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and (ii) the Eagle Ford Shale field, the West Panhandle field and South Texas - Other field during the year ended December 31, 2015 to their estimated fair values. The Company calculated the fair values of the West Panhandle field, the Eagle Ford Shale field and South Texas - Other field using a discounted future cash flow model. Significant Level 3 assumptions associated with the calculations included management's longer-term commodity price outlooks ("Management's Price Outlooks") and management's outlooks for (i) production costs, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) production and (iv) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable reserves. Management's Price Outlooks are developed based on third-party longer-term commodity futures price outlooks as of each measurement date. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine estimated fair value.The following table presents the fair value and fair value adjustments (in millions) for the Company's 2016 and 2015 proved property impairments, as well as the average oil price per barrel ("Bbl") and gas price per British thermal unit ("MMBtu") utilized in respective Management's Price Outlooks:        Management's Price Outlooks  Impairment Date Fair Value Fair Value Adjustment Oil GasWest Panhandle March 2016 $33 $(32) $49.77 $3.24South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale December 2015 $483 $(846) $52.82 $3.34South Texas - Other September 2015 $88 $(72) $57.41 $3.46West Panhandle March 2015 $61 $(138) $65.02 $3.83It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to these or other properties may change in the future resulting in the need to impair their carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows are (i) future adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible oil and gas reserves, (ii) results of future drilling activities, (iii) Management's Price Outlooks and (iv) increases or decreases in production and capital costs associated with these fields.Unproved oil and gas properties. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $32 million to write-off the carrying value of its unproved royalty acreage in Alaska (reported in exploration and abandonments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations) as a result of the operator curtailing operations in the area and Management's Price Outlooks.Financial instruments not carried at fair value. Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:   March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015  CarryingValue FairValue CarryingValue FairValue  (in millions)Commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits $1,369 $1,369 $275 $275Current portion of long-term debt $936 $962 $448 $462Long-term debt $2,724 $2,877 $3,207 $3,206Commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits. Periodically, the Company invests in commercial paper and corporate bonds with investment grade rated entities. The Company also periodically enters into time deposits with financial institutions. The investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and classified as held-to-maturity as the Company has the intent and ability to hold them until they mature. The net carrying value of held-to-maturity investments is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity over the life of the investments. Income related to these investments 13 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2016(Unaudited)is recorded in interest and other income in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. The investments represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy. Commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits are included in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on their maturity dates. The following table provides the components of the Company's cash and cash equivalents and investments as of March 31, 2016:  As of March 31, 2016Consolidated Balance Sheet Location Cash Commercial Paper Corporate Bonds TimeDeposits Total  (in millions)Cash and cash equivalents $1,157 $455 $— $— $1,612Short-term investments — 645 58 190 893Long-term investments — — 21 — 21  $1,157 $1,100 $79 $190 $2,526Debt obligations. Current and noncurrent long-term debt includes the Company's credit facility and the Company's senior notes. The fair value of the Company's debt obligations is determined utilizing inputs that are Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company's credit facility is calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on (i) forecasted contractual interest and fee payments, (ii) forward active market-quoted United States Treasury Bill rates and (iii) the applicable credit-adjustments. The Company's senior notes represent debt securities that are not actively traded on major exchanges. The fair values of the Company's senior notes are based on their periodic values as quoted on the major exchanges.The Company has other financial instruments consisting primarily of accounts receivables, prepaid expenses, notes receivable, payables and other current assets and liabilities that approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and their relatively short maturities. Non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value include assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, goodwill and asset retirement obligations.NOTE E. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. The Company also, from time to time, utilizes interest rate contracts to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company's indebtedness. Oil production derivative activities. All material physical sales contracts governing the Company's oil production are tied directly to, or are highly correlated with, New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices. The Company uses derivative contracts to manage oil price volatility and basis swap contracts to reduce basis risk between NYMEX prices and the actual index prices at which the oil is sold.14 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2016(Unaudited)The following table sets forth the volumes per day associated with the Company's outstanding oil derivative contracts as of March 31, 2016 and the weighted average oil prices for those contracts:  2016  Year Ending December 31, Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter  2017Swap contracts:        Volume (Bbl)60,000 — —  —Price per Bbl$53.08 $— $—  $—Collar contracts with short puts:        Volume (Bbl) (a)43,000 112,000 112,000  72,000Price per Bbl:        Ceiling$73.26 $75.94 $75.94  $61.16Floor$63.29 $65.41 $65.41  $50.97Short put$40.00 $47.03 $47.03  $42.07____________________(a)Subsequent to March 31, 2016, the Company entered into additional oil collar contracts with short puts for 1,000 Bbls per day of 2017 production with a ceiling price of $57.50 per Bbl, a floor price of $47.50 per Bbl and a short put price of $40.00 per Bbl.NGL production derivative activities.

Periodically, the Company enters into buy and sell marketing arrangements to fulfill firm pipeline transportation commitments. Associated with these marketing arrangements, the Company may enter into index swaps to mitigate price risk. As of March 31, 2016, the Company did not have any marketing derivatives outstanding.Interest rate derivative activities. As of March 31, 2016, the Company was a party to interest rate derivative contracts whereby the Company will receive the three-month LIBOR rate for the 10-year period from December 2017 to December 2027 in exchange for paying a weighted average fixed interest rate of 1.98 percent on a notional amount of $200 million on December 15, 2017. Tabular disclosure of derivative financial instruments. All of the Company's derivatives are accounted for as non-hedge derivatives and therefore all changes in the fair values of its derivative contracts are recognized as gains or losses in the earnings of the periods in which they occur. The Company classifies the fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities as net current or noncurrent derivative assets or net current or noncurrent derivative liabilities, whichever the case may be, by commodity and counterparty. The Company enters into derivatives under master netting arrangements, which, in an event of default, allows the Company to offset payables to and receivables from the defaulting counterparty. 16 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2016(Unaudited)The aggregate fair value of the Company's derivative instruments reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets by type and counterparty, including the classification between current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, consists of the following: Fair Value of Derivative Instruments as of March 31, 2016Type Consolidated Balance SheetLocation FairValue Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Fair Value Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet    (in millions)Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      Asset Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $540 $— $540Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $54 $(4) 50        $590Liability Derivatives:     Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $2 $— $2Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $8 $(4) 4Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $2 $— 2        $8Fair Value of Derivative Instruments as of December 31, 2015Type Consolidated Balance SheetLocation FairValue Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Fair Value Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet    (in millions)Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      Asset Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $695 $(1) $694Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $64 $— 64        $758Liability Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $1 $(1) $—Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $1 $— 1        $1The Company uses credit and other financial criteria to evaluate the credit standing of, and to select, counterparties to its derivative instruments.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFinancial and Operating PerformanceThe Company's financial and operating performance for the first quarter of 2016 included the following highlights:•Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2016 was $267 million ($1.65 per diluted share), as compared to net loss of $78 million ($0.52 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2015. The primary components of the increase in the net loss attributable to common stockholders include:•a $198 million decrease in net derivative gains, primarily as a result of changes in forward commodity prices and the Company's portfolio of derivatives;•a $108 million decrease in oil and gas revenues as a result of a 32 percent decrease in the average commodity prices per BOE, partially offset by a 14 percent increase in sales volumes; •a $43 million increase in DD&A expense, primarily attributable to the 14 percent increase in sales volumes and reductions in proved reserves as a result of the decline in commodity prices, partially offset by impairments of proved properties during 2015, which reduced the carrying value of the Company's oil and gas properties;•a $38 million increase in other expense, primarily related to terminated rig contract charges, increased unused firm transportation costs and restructuring charges; •a $34 million increase in exploration and abandonments expense, primarily due to the write-off of the Company's overriding royalty interest in the Nuna prospect in Alaska; and•a $15 million decrease in net margins attributable to purchases and sales of oil and gas used to fulfill transportation commitments; partially offset by•a $106 million reduction in noncash impairment charges related to the Company's West Panhandle field;•a $104 million increase in the Company's income tax benefit as a result of the Company's increase in loss from continuing operations before taxes; and •a $34 million decrease in total oil and gas production costs and production and ad valorem taxes, primarily due to the Company's cost saving initiatives and the decline in commodity prices.•During the first quarter of 2016, average daily sales volumes from continuing operations increased by 14 percent to 221,809 BOEPD, as compared to 193,823 BOEPD during the first quarter of 2015. The increase in first quarter 2016 average daily sales volumes, as compared to the first quarter of 2015, is primarily due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.•Average oil, NGL and gas prices decreased during the first quarter of 2016 to $28.09 per Bbl, $10.33 per Bbl and $1.79 per Mcf, respectively, as compared to $43.02 per Bbl, $15.00 per Bbl and $2.70 per Mcf, respectively, in the first quarter of 2015. •Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $111 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $104 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The $7 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to reductions in operating costs and funds used to satisfy working capital obligations, partially offset by decreases in the Company's oil and gas revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as a result of declines in commodity prices.•Issuance of 13.8 million shares of common stock during the first quarter of 2016 for net cash proceeds of $1.6 billion.•As of March 31, 2016, the Company's net debt to book capitalization decreased to 10 percent, as compared to 21 percent at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the Company's issuance of common stock during the first quarter of 2016.Recent DevelopmentsCommodity prices. North American and worldwide oil, NGL and gas prices remain under pressure given the current oversupply of such commodities. In general, this imbalance between supply and demand reflects the significant supply growth achieved in the United States as a result of shale drilling and oil production increases by certain other countries, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, as part of an effort to retain market share combined with only modest demand growth in the United States and less-than-expected demand in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe and China. Although there has been a dramatic decrease in drilling activity in the industry, oil and NGL storage levels in the United States remain at historically high levels. Until supply and demand balance and the overhang in storage levels begins to decline, prices are expected to remain under pressure. In addition, the lifting of economic sanctions on Iran has resulted in increasing supplies of oil from Iran, adding further downward 23 PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYpressure to oil prices. The reduced demand for drilling rigs, fracture-stimulation services and oilfield supplies during 2015 and thus far into 2016, has led to a decline of these costs. However, despite these cost savings, the Company experienced a significant deterioration in its operating margins during 2015, which have further deteriorated in 2016. The duration and magnitude of the commodity price declines and the timing and amount of cost reductions cannot be accurately predicted. However, the Company does expect adverse charges associated with the decline in commodity prices, including (i) stacked rig charges, (ii) charges associated with excess firm gathering and transportation commitments and (iii) increased depletion, depreciation and amortization expense due to expected declines in the trailing twelve month average oil and gas prices, resulting in reductions in proved reserves as a result of shortening the economic productive lives of the Company's producing wells, partially offset by reserve additions as a results of successful drilling.Low price environment initiatives. Based on the Company's outlook for continuing weak oil prices, the Company is in the process of reducing its Company-wide horizontal drilling activity from 24 rigs at year-end 2015 to 12 rigs by the middle of 2016. The Company currently has 14 horizontal drilling rigs running, all of which are in the Permian Basin. The Company's capital expenditures budget for 2016 is expected to be $2.0 billion, including $1.85 billion for drilling and completions (includes tank batteries, salt water disposal facilities and gas processing facilities) and $150 million for vertical integration, systems upgrades and field facilities.As a result of the reduction in drilling activities, the Company will continue to incur stacked drilling rig charges and charges associated with excess firm gathering and transportation commitments until commodity prices improve, allowing the Company to increase its drilling activities, or the contractual obligations expire. Further, an extended commodity price decline could adversely affect the amount of oil, NGLs and gas that the Company can economically produce, which could result in the Company having to make further downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves. Reductions in estimated proved reserves could increase the amount of depletion, depreciation and amortization expense the Company recognizes as a result of shortening the economic productive lives of the Company's producing wells. It is also possible that the Company's estimates of production or other economic factors could change to such an extent that the Company may be required to impair, as a noncash charge to earnings, the carrying value of the Company's oil and gas properties. The Company performs impairment tests on proved oil and gas properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of proved properties may not be recoverable. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of the Company's oil and gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore an impairment charge would be required to reduce the carrying value of the proved properties to their fair value.In conjunction with its decision to no longer run any drilling rigs in the Eagle Ford Shale play until commodity prices improve, the Company relocated its two Eagle Ford Shale pressure pumping fleets to the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area. This initiative is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2016. In connection therewith, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recognized $3 million of restructuring charges in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company estimates that it will incur an additional $2 million of restructuring charges related thereto during the remainder of 2016. Second Quarter 2016 OutlookBased on current estimates, the Company expects the following operating and financial results from continuing operations for the quarter ending June 30, 2016:Production is forecasted to average 224,000 to 229,000 BOEPD. Production costs (including production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs) are expected to average $9.00 to $11.00 per BOE based on current NYMEX strip commodity prices. DD&A expense is expected to average $17.50 to $19.50 per BOE, reflecting an anticipated further decline in proved reserves as a result of lower commodity prices reducing the economic lives of the Company's producing wells.Total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $20 million to $30 million. General and administrative expense is expected to be $75 million to $80 million. Interest expense is expected to be $55 million to $60 million, and other expense is expected to be $65 million to $75 million. Other expense includes (i) $15 million to $20 million of expected charges for stacked drilling rig charges, (ii) $25 million to $30 million of expected charges associated with excess firm gathering and transportation commitments and (iii) $10 million to $15 million of estimated losses (principally noncash) associated with the portion of vertical integration services provided to nonaffiliated working interest owners, including joint venture partners, in wells operated by the Company. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $4 million to $7 million.The Company's effective income tax rate is expected to range from 35 percent to 40 percent assuming current capital spending plans and no significant mark-to-market changes in the Company's derivative position. Current income taxes are expected to be $1 million to $5 million and are primarily attributable to state taxes.24 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYOperations and Drilling HighlightsThe following table summarizes the Company's average daily oil, NGL, gas and total production by asset area during the three months ended March 31, 2016:  Oil (Bbls) NGLs (Bbls) Gas (Mcf) Total (BOE)Permian Basin 102,016 24,802 132,029 148,823South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale 16,020 10,544 90,290 41,612Raton Basin — — 100,358 16,726West Panhandle 3,360 3,734 13,567 9,354South Texas - Other 1,404 151 22,366 5,283Other 2 1 41 11 Total  122,802 39,232 358,651 221,809The Company's total liquids production from continuing operations increased to 73 percent of total production, on a BOE basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to 69 percent for the same period last year.

The Company reduced its rig count during the first quarter of 2016 to 14 rigs in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area, all of which are drilling horizontal wells. The Company expects to further reduce the rig count to 12 rigs during the second quarter of 2016. During 2016, the Company expects to complete approximately 230 horizontal wells (190 horizontal wells in the northern portion of the play and 40 horizontal wells in the southern portion of the play). Approximately 60% of the horizontal wells are planned to be drilled in the Wolfcamp B interval, 25% in the Wolfcamp A interval and 15% in the Lower Spraberry Shale interval. The Company continues to drill utilizing two-well and three-well pads and expects to spend $1.77 billion of drilling and completion capital in the Spraberry field during 2016. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company placed on production 42 horizontal wells in the northern portion of the play and 13 horizontal wells in the southern portion of the play. In the northern portion of the play, approximately 60% of the wells placed on production were Wolfcamp B interval wells, and the remaining 40 25 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYpercent were split predominantly between Wolfcamp A interval wells and Lower Spraberry Shale wells. In the southern portion of the play, all of the wells placed on production were Wolfcamp B interval wells. The Company continues to utilize its integrated services to control well costs and operating costs in addition to supporting the execution of its drilling and production activities in the Spraberry field. The Company is currently utilizing six Company-owned fracture stimulation fleets totaling approximately 350,000 horsepower to support its drilling operations in the Spraberry field. In April 2016, the Company idled two of its eight fracture stimulation fleets due to reduced demand for fracture stimulation services as a result of the Company's reduced rig count. These assets will not be depreciated while temporarily idled. The Company also owns other field service equipment that supports its drilling and production operations, including pulling units, fracture stimulation tanks, water transport trucks, hot oilers, blowout preventers, construction equipment and fishing tools. In addition, Premier Silica (the Company's wholly-owned sand mining subsidiary) is supplying high-quality and logistically advantaged brown sand for proppant, which is being used by the Company to fracture stimulate horizontal wells in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp Shale intervals.The Company has been and continues to aggressively pursue initiatives to improve drilling and completion efficiencies and reduce costs. The most significant drilling and completion cost reductions to date have been for casing, tubing, materials for drilling and fracture stimulation, fuel charges, labor and transportation, rental equipment and well services, while efficiency gains include optimizing completions in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp Shale intervals. The Company's long-term growth plan continues to be focused on optimizing the development of the field and addressing the future requirements for water, field infrastructure, gas processing, sand, pipeline takeaway, oilfield services, tubulars, electricity, buildings and roads. However, much of the Company's front-end loaded infrastructure plans, which were expected to provide significant future cost savings and support the Company's long-term growth plan in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area, have been minimized given the significant decline in oil prices. The Company plans to continue to evaluate its infrastructure plans for a field-wide water distribution network, additional gas processing facilities and expansion of Premier Silica's Brady sand mine based on the Company's outlook for commodity prices and/or incremental cost reductions.Eagle Ford Shale area. In the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas, the rig count has been reduced to zero rigs given current commodity prices that continue to adversely affect well returns. The Company plans to spend $60 million of capital in 2016 to complete 18 Eagle Ford Shale wells and add field compression to reduce wellhead pressures. Due to the forecasted reduction in drilling activity, the Company expects to incur additional expense associated with unused firm purchase, gathering, processing, transportation and fractionation commitments in 2016.In July 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its 50.1 percent interest in EFS Midstream to an unaffiliated third party, with the Company receiving total consideration of $1.0 billion, of which $530 million was received at closing and the remaining approximately $500 million will be received in July 2016. As a result of the sale, the Company no longer receives its share of the cash flow generated by EFS Midstream, which had the effect of increasing the Company's third-party transportation component of oil and gas production costs by approximately $0.75 per BOE. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company also extended its downstream processing and transportation contracts to 20 years, with improved terms. Results of Operations from Continuing OperationsOil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues totaled $409 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $517 million for the same period in 2015. The decrease in oil and gas revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to declines of 35 percent, 31 percent and 34 percent in average oil, NGL and gas prices, respectively, partially offset by 25 percent and 11 percent increases in daily oil and NGL sales volumes, respectively. The following table provides average daily sales volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:   Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2016 2015Oil (Bbls) 122,802 98,554NGLs (Bbls) 39,232 35,364Gas (Mcf) 358,651 359,428Total (BOEs) 221,809 193,823Average daily BOE sales volumes increased by 14 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, principally due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program. Production 26 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYfor the three months ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015 reflects lower NGL production volumes of approximately 5,000 barrels per day and 4,600 barrels per day, respectively, due to voluntary reductions in recoveries of ethane since it had a higher value if sold as part of the gas stream. The oil, NGL and gas prices that the Company reports are based on the market prices received for each commodity. The following table provides the Company's average prices for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:   Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2016 2015Oil (per Bbl) $28.09 $43.02NGL (per Bbl) $10.33 $15.00Gas (per Mcf) $1.79 $2.70Total (per BOE) $20.28 $29.63Sales of purchased oil and gas. The Company periodically enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company’s areas of production. The Company enters into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to diversify a portion of the Company's WTI oil sales to a Gulf Coast oil price and to satisfy unused pipeline capacity commitments. Revenues and expenses from these transactions are presented on a gross basis as the Company acts as a principal in the transaction by assuming the risk and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, of the commodities purchased and assuming responsibility to deliver the commodities sold. The net effect of third party purchases and sales of oil and gas for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was a loss of $20 million, as compared to a loss of $5 million for the same period in 2015. Firm transportation payments on excess pipeline capacity commitments are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information on transportation commitment charges. Interest and other income. Interest and other income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $8 million, as compared to $7 million for the same period in 2015. See Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information.Derivative gains, net. The Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company recorded $43 million of net derivative gains on commodity price and interest rate derivatives, of which $218 million represented net cash receipts. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company recorded $241 million of net derivative gains, of which $206 million represented net cash receipts.The following tables detail the net cash receipts (payments) on the Company's commodity derivatives and the relative price impact (per Bbl or Mcf) for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:  Three Months Ended March 31, 2016  Net cash receipts Price impact  (in millions)   Oil derivative receipts $194 $17.26per BblNGL derivative receipts 4 $1.09per BblGas derivative receipts 20 $0.61per McfTotal net commodity derivative receipts $218   27 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY  Three Months Ended March 31, 2015  Net cash receipts (payments) Price impact  (in millions)   Oil derivative receipts $181 $20.35per BblNGL derivative payments (1) $(0.29)per BblGas derivative receipts 26 $0.82per McfTotal net commodity derivative receipts $206   See Notes D and E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information regarding the Company's derivative activities and market risks associated with those activities. Gain on disposition of assets, net. The Company recorded net gains on the disposition of assets of $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $1 million for the same period in 2015. Oil and gas production costs. The Company recorded oil and gas production costs of $156 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $180 million during the same period in 2015. Lease operating expenses and workover costs represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while third-party transportation charges represent the cost to transport volumes produced to a sales point. Net natural gas plant charges represent the net costs to gather and process the Company's gas, reduced by net revenues earned from the gathering and processing of third-party gas in Company-owned facilities.Total oil and gas production costs per BOE for the three months ended March 31, 2016 decreased by 25 percent, as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in lease operating expenses per BOE during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to a greater proportion of the Company's production coming from horizontal wells in Spraberry/Wolfcamp area that have lower per BOE lease operating costs, cost reduction initiatives and lower electricity and fuel costs, which are impacted by lower commodity prices. The increase in third-party transportation charges reflects the Company no longer receiving cash flow generated by EFS Midstream as a result of its sale in July 2015. The following table provides the components of the Company's oil and gas production costs per BOE for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:   Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2016 2015Lease operating expenses $5.20 $7.83Third-party transportation charges 2.01 1.56Net natural gas plant charges 0.22 0.31Workover costs 0.28 0.62Total production costs $7.71 $10.32Production and ad valorem taxes. The Company's production and ad valorem taxes were $29 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $39 million for the same period in 2015. In general, production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, Texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. 28 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe following table provides the Company's production and ad valorem taxes per BOE for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:  Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2016 2015Production taxes $0.80 $1.22Ad valorem taxes 0.66 1.02Total production and ad valorem taxes $1.46 $2.24Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company's DD&A expense was $353 million ($17.49 per BOE) for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $310 million ($17.77 per BOE) during the same period in 2015. The change in per BOE DD&A expense during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to a decrease in depletion expense on oil and gas properties. Depletion expense on oil and gas properties was $16.94 per BOE during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $17.15 per BOE during the same period in 2015. The change in per BOE depletion expense during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to proved oil and gas property impairment charges during 2015 that had the effect of reducing the carrying value of the Company's oil and gas properties, partially offset by declines in commodity prices during 2015 and 2016 that led to a reduction in proved reserves as a result of shortening the economic productive lives of the Company's producing wells. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the Company's proved oil and gas property impairment charges.Impairment of oil and gas properties. The Company performs assessments of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. The cash flow model the Company uses to assess proved properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows are (i) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves (ii) results of future drilling activities, (iii) Management's Price Outlook and (iv) increases or decreases in production costs and capital costs associated with those fields. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each measurement date.As a result of the Company's proved property impairment assessments, the Company recognized pretax, noncash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of (i) its West Panhandle Field during the three months ended March 31, 2016 ($32 million impairment charge) and (ii) the Eagle Ford Shale field ($846 million impairment charge), the West Panhandle field ($138 million impairment charge) and South Texas - Other field ($72 million impairment charge) during the year ended December 31, 2015 to their estimated fair values. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the Company's proved oil and gas property impairment charges.Although the Company's estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to its Permian Basin oil and gas properties indicated on March 31, 2016 that its carrying amount was expected to be recovered, the Company's impairment assessment indicated that the assets are at risk for impairment if estimates of future cash flows decline. For example, the Company estimates that the carrying values of its Permian Basin assets may become partially impaired if the average oil price in Management's Price Outlook of $49.77 per Bbl as of March 31, 2016 were to decline by approximately $3.00 to $8.00 per Bbl. The Company's Permian Basin oil and gas properties are long-lived assets that had a carrying value of $8.9 billion as of March 31, 2016. If the Company's Permian Basin oil and gas properties were to become impaired in a future period, the Company could recognize impairment charges in that period that could range from $5 billion to $7 billion. In addition, the Company could recognize noncash, pretax impairment charges that could range from $500 million to $700 million to reduce the carrying value of its vertical integration assets that provide services for the Permian Basin assets. The carrying values of those assets are included in "other property and equipment, net" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Also, if Management's Price Outlook were to decline further, it may constitute significant negative evidence as to whether it is more likely than not that all of the Company's deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expirations. 29 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYExploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the Company's geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes expenses and lease abandonments and other exploration expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):   Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2016 2015Geological and geophysical $19 $20Exploratory dry holes 1 5Leasehold abandonments and other 39 —  $59 $25During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company incurred leasehold abandonments primarily related to the abandonment of unproved properties in the Permian Basin and unproved acreage in Alaska in which the Company held an overriding royalty interest. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company drilled and evaluated 53 exploration/extension wells, all of which were successfully completed as discoveries. During the same period in 2015, the Company drilled and evaluated 52 exploration/extension wells, 51 of which were successfully completed as discoveries.General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $74 million ($3.66 per BOE), as compared to $82 million ($4.70 per BOE) for the same period in 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expense during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to the Company's cost reduction initiatives, including not replacing personnel who have left the Company and reduced contractor activity.Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations was $5 million and $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for information regarding the Company's asset retirement obligations. Interest expense. Interest expense was $55 million and $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to the Company's December 2015 issuance of $500 million of 3.45% Senior Notes due 2021 and $500 million of 4.45% Senior Notes due 2026. The weighted average interest rate on the Company's indebtedness for the three months ended March 31, 2016, including the effects of capitalized interest, was 5.7 percent, as compared to 6.6 percent for the same period in 2015. Other expense. Other expense was $87 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $49 million during the same period in 2015. The increase in other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to (i) an increase of $15 million in terminated rig contract charges, (ii) a $12 million increase in the net loss from Company-provided fracture stimulation and related service operations that are provided to third party working interest owners, (iii) an increase of $10 million in unused firm transportation costs and (iv) restructuring charges of $3 million associated with the Company's relocation of its pressure pumping operations in South Texas to the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area. See Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information. Income tax benefit. The Company recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $141 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to an income tax benefit of $37 million for the same period in 2015. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was 35 percent, as compared to 33 percent for the same period in 2015. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate during the three months ended March 31, 2015 was primarily due to state income tax apportionments and nondeductible expenses. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company reported no income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the three months ended March 31, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company reported a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $4 million, which was primarily comprised of an arbitration award related to plugging and abandonment obligations associated with two Gulf of Mexico wells from which Pioneer withdrew in 2009.Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and LiquidityCapital commitments. The Company's primary needs for cash are for capital expenditures and acquisition expenditures on oil and gas properties and related vertical integration assets and facilities, payment of contractual obligations, including debt 30 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYmaturities, dividends and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, cash and cash equivalents on hand, sales of investments in commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits that are classified as short-term and long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, proceeds from divestitures or external financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" below.The Company's capital budget for 2016 is $2.0 billion (excluding acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs), which includes approximately $1.85 billion for drilling operations and $150 million for water infrastructure, vertical integration system upgrades and field facilities. The Company's capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2016 were $600 million, consisting of $527 million for drilling operations (excluding acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs) and $73 million for buildings, vertical integration and other plant and equipment additions. Based on results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and Management's Price Outlook, the Company expects its net cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, the receipt of the remaining approximately $500 million of proceeds from the EFS Midstream divestiture, sales of short-term and long-term investments and, if necessary, availability under the Credit Facility to be sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. Investing activities. Investing activities used $1.5 billion of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to $717 million of cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015, is primarily due to (i) the purchase of $914 million of investment securities and (ii) a $16 million increase in additions to other assets, partially offset by (iii) a $187 million decrease in additions to oil and gas properties. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company's expenditures for investing activities were primarily funded by net cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and the Company's issuance of 13.8 million shares of common stock during the quarter for cash proceeds of $1.6 billion.Dividends/distributions. During March of 2016 and 2015, the Board declared semiannual dividends of $0.04 per common share. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, and, if declared, the Board may change the current dividend amount based on the Company's liquidity and capital resources at the time. Contractual obligations, including off-balance sheet obligations. The Company's contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments (primarily related to commitments to pay day rates for contracted drilling rigs), capital funding obligations, derivative obligations, firm transportation and fractionation commitments, minimum annual gathering, processing and transportation commitments and other liabilities (including postretirement benefit obligations). From time-to-time, the Company enters into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of March 31, 2016, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company had entered into included (i) operating lease agreements, (ii) drilling commitments, (iii) firm purchase, transportation and fractionation commitments, (iv) open purchase commitments and (v) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable. The contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable include (i) derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices or interest rates, (ii) gathering, processing (primarily treating and fractionation) and transportation commitments on uncertain volumes of future throughput, (iii) open delivery commitments and (iv) indemnification obligations following certain divestitures. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other parties that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. There were no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations during the first quarter of 2016.The Company's commodity and interest rate derivative contracts are periodically measured and recorded at fair value and continue to be subject to market or credit risk. As of March 31, 2016, these contracts represented net assets of $582 million. The ultimate liquidation value of the Company's commodity and interest rate derivatives will be dependent upon actual future commodity prices and interest rates, which may differ materially from the inputs used to determine the derivatives' fair values as of March 31, 2016. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information about the Company's derivative instruments and market risk.Capital resources. The Company's primary capital resources are cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and proceeds from financing activities (principally borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility or issuances of debt or equity securities). If internal cash flows do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may reduce its level of capital expenditures, and/or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using cash on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments, availability under its Credit Facility, issuances of debt or equity securities or obtain capital from other sources, such as through sales of nonstrategic assets. 31 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYOperating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $111 million, as compared to $104 million during the same period in 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015, is primarily due to reductions in operating costs and funds used to satisfy working capital obligations, partially offset by decreases in the Company's oil and gas revenues between periods as a result of declines in commodity prices.Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $1.6 billion, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $29 million during the same period in 2015. The change to net cash provided by financing activities from net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015, is primarily the result of the Company's issuance of 13.8 million shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $1.6 billion.As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The Company cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of any such actions as they are subject to market conditions, among other factors. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Board. Liquidity. The Company's principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments and unused borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2016, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its Credit Facility, leaving $1.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of March 31, 2016. The Company also had cash on hand of $1.6 billion, short-term investments of $893 million and long-term investments of $21 million as of March 31, 2016. If internal cash flows do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may reduce its level of capital expenditures, reduce dividend payments, and/or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using cash on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments, availability under its Credit Facility, issuances of debt or equity securities or other sources, such as sales of nonstrategic assets. The Company cannot provide any assurance that needed short-term or long-term liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Although the Company expects that the combination of internal operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents on hand, the receipt of the remaining approximately $500 million of proceeds from the EFS Midstream divestiture, sales of short-term and long-term investments and, if necessary, available capacity under the Company's Credit Facility will be adequate to fund 2016 and 2017 capital expenditures, dividend payments and provide adequate liquidity to fund other needs, including debt maturities, no assurances can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Company's future needs.Debt ratings. The Company is rated as investment grade by three credit rating agencies. The Company receives debt credit ratings from several of the major ratings agencies, which are subject to regular reviews. The Company believes that each of the rating agencies considers many factors in determining the Company's ratings including: (i) production growth opportunities, (ii) liquidity, (iii) debt levels, (iv) asset composition and (v) proved reserve mix. A reduction in the Company's debt ratings could increase the interest rates that the Company incurs on Credit Facility borrowings and could negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. Book capitalization and current ratio. The Company's net book capitalization at March 31, 2016 was $10.8 billion, consisting of $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments of $914 million, debt of $3.7 billion and equity of $9.7 billion. The Company's net debt to net book capitalization decreased to 10 percent at March 31, 2016 from 21 percent at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the Company's issuance of 13.8 million shares of common stock during the first quarter of 2016 for cash proceeds of $1.6 billion. The Company's ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to 2.29 to 1.00 at March 31, 2016, as compared to 2.19 to 1.00 at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the aforementioned issuance of common stock during the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by the reclassification of the Company's 6.65% Senior Notes to a current liability. New accounting pronouncements. The effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements."32 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe following quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are supplementary to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures provided in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As such, the information contained herein should be read in conjunction with the related disclosures in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company's potential exposure to market risks. The term "market risks," insofar as it relates to currently anticipated transactions of the Company, refers to the risk of loss arising from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. These disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators regarding how the Company views and manages ongoing market risk exposures. None of the Company's market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for speculative purposes.The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Company's open derivative contracts during the three months ending March 31, 2016:  Derivative Contract Net Assets  Commodities Interest Rates Total  (in millions)Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2015 $757 $— $757Changes in contract fair value 45 (2) 43Contract maturity receipts (218) — (218)Fair value of contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2016 $584 $(2) $582Interest rate sensitivity. See Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity included in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information regarding the Company's long-term debt.33 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe following table provides information about financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of March 31, 2016 and that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents debt maturities by expected maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given current contractual terms and market conditions and the debt's estimated fair value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of March 31, 2016. Although the Company had no outstanding variable rate debt as of March 31, 2016, the average variable contractual rates for its credit facility projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on April 22, 2016 is presented in the table below.

(c)The variable rate receivable represents the April 22, 2016 forecasted three-month LIBOR rate for the 10-year period from December 2017 through December 2027.Commodity derivative instruments and price sensitivity. The following table provides information about the Company's oil, NGL and gas derivative financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil, NGL and gas prices as of March 31, 2016. Although mitigated by the Company's derivative activities, declines in oil, NGL and gas prices would reduce the Company's revenues.The Company manages commodity price risk with derivative contracts, such as swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short put options. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide minimum ("floor" or "long put") and maximum ("ceiling") prices on a notional amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price. Collar contracts with short put options differ from other collar contracts by virtue of the short put option price, below which the Company's realized price will exceed the variable market prices by the long put-to-short put price differential.See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for a description of the accounting procedures followed by the Company for its derivative financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of the Company's derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil, NGL or gas prices.34 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY 2016  Year Ending December 31, Asset (Liability) Fair Value at March 31, Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter  2017 2015 (a)          (in millions)Oil Derivatives:          Average daily notional Bbl volumes:          Swap contracts60,000 — —  — $72Weighted average fixed price per Bbl$53.08 $— $—  $—  Collar contracts with short puts (b)43,000 112,000 112,000  72,000 $454Weighted average ceiling price per Bbl$73.26 $75.94 $75.94  $61.16  Weighted average floor price per Bbl$63.29 $65.41 $65.41  $50.97  Weighted average short put price per Bbl$40.00 $47.03 $47.03  $42.07  Average forward NYMEX oil prices (c)$43.73 $44.97 $45.96  $47.33  NGL Derivatives:          Average daily notional Bbl volumes (d):          Propane swap contracts (e)7,500 7,500 7,500  — $5Weighted average fixed price per Bbl$21.57 $21.57 $21.57  $—  Average forward propane prices (c)$19.95 $20.48 $21.16  $—  Gas Derivatives:          Average daily notional MMBtu volumes:          Swap contracts70,000 70,000 70,000  — $35Weighted average fixed price per MMBtu$4.06 $4.06 $4.06  $—  Collar contracts with short puts (f)180,000 180,000 180,000  80,000 $20Weighted average ceiling price per MMBtu$4.01 $4.01 $4.01  $3.15  Weighted average floor price per MMBtu$3.24 $3.24 $3.24  $2.75  Weighted average short put price per MMBtu$2.78 $2.78 $2.78  $2.35  Average forward NYMEX gas prices (c)$2.20 $2.44 $2.76  $2.96  Basis swap contracts         $(2)Gulf Coast index swap contracts (g)10,000 10,000 10,000  —  Weighted average fixed price per MMBtu$— $— $—  $—  Average forward basis differential prices (h)$(0.03) $0.01 $(0.05)  $—  Mid-Continent index swap contracts (g)15,000 15,000 15,000  45,000  Weighted average fixed price per MMBtu$(0.32) $(0.32) $(0.32)  $(0.32)  Average forward basis differential prices (h)$(0.29) $(0.24) $(0.12)  $(0.22)  Permian Basin index swap contracts (i)— — 34,946  9,863  Weighted average fixed price per MMBtu$— $— $0.41  $0.37  Average forward basis differential prices (j)$— $— $0.32  $0.22   ___________________(a)In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 210-20 and ASC 815-10, the Company classifies the fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities executed under master netting arrangements as net derivative assets or net derivative liabilities, as the case may be.

The Company will receive the NYMEX HH price plus $0.91 per MMBtu on 2,768 MMBtu per day (equivalent to 1,000 Bbls per day of ethane) for May 2016 through December 2016. Based on April 22, 2016 market quotes, the average forward ethane price for 2017 was $10.68 per Bbl and the average forward price differential between NYMEX Henry Hub and Mont Belvieu Ethane was $0.80 per MMBtu.35 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY(e)Represents swaps that reduce the price volatility of propane forecasted for sale by the Company at Mont Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas-posted prices.(f)Subsequent to March 31, 2016, the Company entered into additional gas collar contracts with short puts for 50,000 MMBtus per day of 2018 production with a ceiling price of $3.40 per MMBtu, a floor price of $2.75 per MMBtu and a short put price of $2.25 per MMBtu.(g)Represent swaps that fix the basis differentials between the index prices at which the Company sells its Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent gas and the NYMEX Henry Hub index price used in gas swap and collar contracts with short puts.(h)The average forward basis differential prices are based on April 22, 2016 market quotes for basis differentials between the relevant index prices and NYMEX-quoted forward prices.(i)Represent swaps that fix the basis differentials between Permian Basin index prices and southern California index prices for Permian Basin gas forecasted for sale in southern California.(j)The average forward basis differential prices are based on April 22, 2016 market quotes for basis differentials between Permian Basin index prices and southern California index prices.Marketing and basis differential derivatives. Periodically, the Company enters into buy and sell marketing arrangements to fulfill firm pipeline transportation commitments. Associated with these marketing arrangements, the Company may enter into index swaps to mitigate price risk. As of March 31, 2016, the Company did not have any marketing derivatives outstanding. 36 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYItem 4. Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Company's management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 37 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYPART II.
