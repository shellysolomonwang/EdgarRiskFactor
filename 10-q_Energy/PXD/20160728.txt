Gas equivalents are determined under the relative energy content method by using the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one Bbl of oil or natural gas liquid.•"BOEPD" means BOE per day.•"Btu" means British thermal unit, which is a measure of the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit.•"Conway" means the daily average natural gas liquids components as priced in Oil Price Information Service ("OPIS") in the table "U.S. and Canada LP – Gas Weekly Averages" at Conway, Kansas.•"DD&A" means depletion, depreciation and amortization.•"GAAP" means accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States of America.•"LIBOR" means London Interbank Offered Rate, which is a market rate of interest.•"Mcf" means one thousand cubic feet and is a measure of gas volume.•"MMBtu" means one million Btus.•"Mont Belvieu" means the daily average natural gas liquids components as priced in OPIS in the table "U.S. and Canada LP – Gas Weekly Averages" at Mont Belvieu, Texas.•"NGL" means natural gas liquid.•"NYMEX" means the New York Mercantile Exchange.•"Pioneer" or the "Company" means Pioneer Natural Resources Company and its subsidiaries.•"Proved reserves" mean the quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes: (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons ("LKH") as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil ("HKO") elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when: (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based; and (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.•"U.S." means United States.•With respect to information on the working interest in wells, drilling locations and acreage, "net" wells, drilling locations and acres are determined by multiplying "gross" wells, drilling locations and acres by the Company's working interest in such wells, drilling locations or acres. Unless otherwise specified, wells, drilling locations and acreage statistics quoted herein represent gross wells, drilling locations or acres.•Unless otherwise indicated, all currency amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars.4 Table of ContentsPART I.

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.9 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2016(Unaudited)NOTE A. Organization and Nature of OperationsPioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer" or the "Company") is a Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production company operating in the United States, with operations primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas, the Raton field in southeast Colorado and the West Panhandle field in the Texas Panhandle.NOTE B. Basis of PresentationPresentation. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of June 30, 2016 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 include all adjustments and accruals, consisting only of normal, recurring accrual adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") have been condensed in or omitted from this report pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). These consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial statement and footnote amounts in order to conform to the 2016 presentation. Restructuring. In February 2016, the Company announced plans to restructure its pressure pumping operations in South Texas, including relocating its two Eagle Ford Shale pressure pumping fleets to the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area. In connection therewith, the Company offered severance to certain employees and relocated a number of other employees from its South Texas locations to its operations in the Permian Basin. This initiative was substantially complete as of June 30, 2016. In connection therewith, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized $1 million and $4 million, respectively, of restructuring charges in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The restructuring charges for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included approximately $3 million in cash employee severance costs and $1 million in employee relocation and other costs. In May 2015, the Company announced plans to restructure its operations in Colorado, including closing its office in Denver, Colorado and eliminating its Trinidad-based pressure pumping operations. The restructuring plan was substantially complete as of December 31, 2015. In connection therewith, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recognized $15 million of restructuring charges in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.As of June 30, 2016, the Company had $3 million of restructuring liabilities recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, primarily related to future lease obligations associated with its Denver, Colorado office. Issuance of common stock. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company issued 6.0 million shares of common stock and received cash proceeds of $937 million, net of associated underwriting and offering expenses. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company issued 13.8 million shares of common stock and received cash proceeds of $1.6 billion, net of associated underwriting and offering expenses. New accounting pronouncements. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses." ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Entities will apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and does not believe this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.10 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2016(Unaudited)In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting." ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as certain classification changes in the statement of cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases." ASU 2016-02 requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases currently classified as operating leases and makes certain changes to the way lease expenses are accounted for. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods beginning the following year. This update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." ASU 2016-01 changes certain guidance related to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted for the majority of the update, but is permitted for two of its provisions. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition," and most industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, which rescinds guidance from the SEC on accounting for gas balancing arrangements and will eliminate the use of the entitlements method. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified approach to adopt the new standards. The Company is evaluating the new guidance and has not determined the impact this standard may have on its consolidated financial statements or decided upon its method of adoption.NOTE C. Divestitures EFS Midstream. In July 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its 50.1 percent equity interest in EFS Midstream LLC ("EFS Midstream") to an unaffiliated third party, with the Company receiving total consideration of $1.0 billion, of which $530 million was received in cash at closing and the remaining $501 million was in the form of a note, which was payable to the Company one year from closing. The note receivable was paid in full in July 2016. See Note O for additional information on the payment of the note receivable.NOTE D. Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based upon inputs that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, which are characterized according to a hierarchy that prioritizes those inputs based on the degree to which they are observable. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources, whereas unobservable inputs reflect a company's own market assumptions, which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort. The three input levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:•Level 1 – quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•Level 2 – quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates) and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.•Level 3 – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.11 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2016(Unaudited)Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value input hierarchy level to which an asset or liability measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 for each of the fair value hierarchy levels:   Fair Value Measurement at June 30, 2016 Using    Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) Fair Value at June 30, 2016  (in millions)Assets:        Commodity derivatives $— $285 $— $285Deferred compensation plan assets 78 — — 78Total assets 78 285 — 363Liabilities:        Commodity derivatives — 42 — 42Interest rate derivatives — 9 — 9Total liabilities — 51 — 51Total recurring fair value measurements $78 $234 $— $312Commodity derivatives. The Company's commodity derivatives represent oil, natural gas liquids ("NGL") and gas swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts. The asset and liability measurements for the Company's commodity derivative contracts represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow and option-pricing models for valuing its commodity derivatives.The asset and liability values attributable to the Company's commodity derivatives were determined based on inputs that include (i) the contracted notional volumes, (ii) independent active market price quotes, (iii) the applicable estimated credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve and (iv) the implied rate of volatility inherent in the collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts, which is based on active and independent market-quoted volatility factors.Deferred compensation plan assets. The Company's deferred compensation plan assets represent investments in equity and mutual fund securities that are actively traded on major exchanges. These investments are measured based on observable prices on major exchanges. As of June 30, 2016, the significant inputs to these asset values represented Level 1 independent active exchange market price inputs. Interest rate derivatives. The Company's interest rate derivative liabilities represent interest rate swap contracts. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow models for valuing its interest rate derivatives. The derivative values attributable to the Company's interest rate derivative contracts are based on (i) the contracted notional amounts, (ii) forward active market-quoted London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and (iii) the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve. The Company's interest rate derivative fair value measurements represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. These assets and liabilities can include inventory, proved and unproved oil and gas properties and other long-lived assets that are written down to fair value when they are impaired or held for sale. The Company recognized noncash impairment charges of $5 million and $9 million for the the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, attributable to inventory and other property and equipment.Proved oil and gas properties. As a result of the Company's proved property impairment assessments, the Company recognized pretax, noncash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of (i) the West Panhandle field during the three 12 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2016(Unaudited)months ended March 31, 2016 and (ii) the Eagle Ford Shale field, the West Panhandle field and the South Texas - Other field during the year ended December 31, 2015 to their estimated fair values. The Company calculated the fair values of the West Panhandle field, the Eagle Ford Shale field and the South Texas - Other field using a discounted future cash flow model. Significant Level 3 assumptions associated with the calculations included management's longer-term commodity price outlooks ("Management's Price Outlooks") and management's outlooks for (i) production costs, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii) production and (iv) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable reserves. Management's Price Outlooks are developed based on third-party longer-term commodity futures price outlooks as of each measurement date. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine estimated fair value.The following table presents the fair value and fair value adjustments (in millions) for the Company's 2016 and 2015 proved property impairments, as well as the average oil price per barrel ("Bbl") and gas price per British thermal unit ("MMBtu") utilized in respective Management's Price Outlooks:        Management's Price Outlooks  Impairment Date Fair Value Fair Value Adjustment Oil GasWest Panhandle March 2016 $33 $(32) $49.77 $3.24South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale December 2015 $483 $(846) $52.82 $3.34South Texas - Other September 2015 $88 $(72) $57.41 $3.46West Panhandle March 2015 $61 $(138) $65.02 $3.83It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to these or other properties may change in the future resulting in the need to impair their carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows are (i) future adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved and risk-adjusted probable and possible oil and gas reserves, (ii) results of future drilling activities, (iii) Management's Price Outlooks and (iv) increases or decreases in production and capital costs associated with these reserves.Unproved oil and gas properties. During March 2016, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $32 million to write-off the carrying value of its unproved royalty acreage in Alaska (reported in exploration and abandonments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations) as a result of the operator curtailing operations in the area and Management's Price Outlooks.Financial instruments not carried at fair value. Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:   June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015  CarryingValue FairValue CarryingValue FairValue  (in millions)Commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits $1,521 $1,521 $275 $275Current portion of long-term debt $939 $959 $448 $462Long-term debt $2,725 $2,999 $3,207 $3,206Commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits. Periodically, the Company invests in commercial paper and corporate bonds with investment grade rated entities. The Company also periodically enters into time deposits with financial institutions. The investments are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and classified as held-to-maturity as the Company has the intent and ability to hold them until they mature. The net carrying value of held-to-maturity investments is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity over the life of the investments. Income related to these investments is recorded in interest and other income in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. The investments represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy. Commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits are included in cash and cash equivalents, short-13 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2016(Unaudited)term investments or long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on their maturity dates.

The fair value of the Company's credit facility is calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on (i) forecasted contractual interest and fee payments, (ii) forward active market-quoted United States Treasury Bill rates and (iii) the applicable credit-adjustments. The Company's senior notes represent debt securities that are not actively traded on major exchanges. The fair values of the Company's senior notes are based on their periodic values as quoted on the major exchanges.The Company has other financial instruments consisting primarily of accounts receivables, prepaid expenses, notes receivable, payables and other current assets and liabilities that approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and their relatively short maturities. Non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value include assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, goodwill and asset retirement obligations.NOTE E. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. The Company also, from time to time, utilizes interest rate contracts to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company's indebtedness. Periodically, the Company may pay a premium to enter into commodity contracts. Premiums paid, if any, have been nominal in relation to the value of the underlying asset in the contract. The Company recognizes the nominal premium payments as an increase to the value of derivative assets when paid. All derivatives are adjusted to fair value as of each balance sheet date. Oil production derivative activities. All material physical sales contracts governing the Company's oil production are tied directly to, or are highly correlated with, New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices. The Company uses derivative contracts to manage oil price volatility and basis swap contracts to reduce basis risk between NYMEX prices and the actual index prices at which the oil is sold.14 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2016(Unaudited)The following table sets forth the volumes per day associated with the Company's outstanding oil derivative contracts as of June 30, 2016 and the weighted average oil prices for those contracts:  2016  Year Ending December 31, Third Quarter Fourth Quarter  2017Collar contracts:      Volume (Bbl)— —  6,000Price per Bbl:      Ceiling$— $—  $70.40Floor$— $—  $50.00Collar contracts with short puts:      Volume (Bbl) (a)112,000 112,000  75,000Price per Bbl:      Ceiling$75.94 $75.94  $61.72Floor$65.41 $65.41  $49.62Short put$47.03 $47.03  $41.41____________________(a)During June 2016, the Company paid $12 million to convert 15,000 Bbls per day of 2017 collar contracts with short puts into new 2017 collar contracts with short puts with a ceiling price of $60.00 per Bbl, a floor price of $45.00 per Bbl and a short put price of $40.00 per Bbl.

The Company will receive the HH price plus the price differential on 2,768 MMBtu per day, which is equivalent to 1,000 Bbls per day of ethane.Gas production derivative activities. All material physical sales contracts governing the Company's gas production are tied directly or indirectly to HH gas prices or regional index prices where the gas is sold. The Company uses derivative contracts to manage gas price volatility and basis swap contracts to reduce basis risk between HH prices and the actual index prices at which the gas is sold.16 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2016(Unaudited)The following table sets forth the volumes per day associated with the Company's outstanding gas derivative contracts as of June 30, 2016 and the weighted average gas prices for those contracts:  2016 Year Ending December 31, Third Quarter Fourth Quarter 2017 2018Swap contracts:       Volume (MMBtu) 70,000 70,000 — —Price per MMBtu$4.06 $4.06 $— $—Collar contracts with short puts:       Volume (MMBtu) (a)180,000 180,000 80,000 50,000Price per MMBtu:       Ceiling$4.01 $4.01 $3.15 $3.40Floor$3.24 $3.24 $2.75 $2.75Short put$2.78 $2.78 $2.35 $2.25Basis swap contracts:       Gulf Coast index swap volume (b)10,000 10,000 — —Price differential ($/MMBtu)$— $— $— $—Mid-Continent index swap volume (b)15,000 15,000 45,000 —Price differential ($/MMBtu)$(0.32) $(0.32) $(0.32) $—Permian Basin index swap volume (c)— 34,946 9,863 —Price differential ($/MMBtu)$— $0.41 $0.37 $—____________________(a)During the period from July 1, 2016 through July 26, 2016, the Company entered into additional gas collar contracts with short puts for 50,000 MMBtu per day of 2017 production with a ceiling price of $3.76 per MMBtu, a floor price of $3.00 per MMBtu and a short put price of $2.50 per MMBtu.(b)Represent swaps that fix the basis differentials between the index prices at which the Company sells its Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent gas, respectively, and the HH index price used in gas swap and collar contracts with short puts.(c) Represent swaps that fix the basis differentials between Permian Basin index prices and southern California index prices for Permian Basin gas forecasted for sale in southern California.Marketing and basis derivative activities. Periodically, the Company enters into buy and sell marketing arrangements to fulfill firm pipeline transportation commitments. Associated with these marketing arrangements, the Company may enter into index swaps to mitigate price risk. As of June 30, 2016, the Company did not have any marketing derivatives outstanding.Interest rate derivative activities. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was a party to interest rate derivative contracts whereby the Company will receive the three-month LIBOR rate for the 10-year period from December 2017 to December 2027 in exchange for paying a weighted average fixed interest rate of 1.94 percent on a notional amount of $250 million on December 15, 2017. Tabular disclosure of derivative financial instruments. All of the Company's derivatives are accounted for as non-hedge derivatives and therefore all changes in the fair values of its derivative contracts are recognized as gains or losses in the earnings of the periods in which they occur. The Company classifies the fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities as net current or noncurrent derivative assets or net current or noncurrent derivative liabilities, whichever the case may be, by commodity and counterparty. The Company enters into derivatives under master netting arrangements, which, in an event of default, allows the Company to offset payables to and receivables from the defaulting counterparty. 17 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJune 30, 2016(Unaudited)The aggregate fair value of the Company's derivative instruments reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets by type and counterparty, including the classification between current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, consists of the following: Fair Value of Derivative Instruments as of June 30, 2016Type Consolidated Balance SheetLocation FairValue Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Fair Value Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet    (in millions)Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      Asset Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $294 $(21) $273Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $18 $(6) 12        $285Liability Derivatives:     Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $29 $(21) $8Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $40 $(6) 34Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $9 $— 9        $51Fair Value of Derivative Instruments as of December 31, 2015Type Consolidated Balance SheetLocation FairValue Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Fair Value Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet    (in millions)Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      Asset Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $695 $(1) $694Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $64 $— 64        $758Liability Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $1 $(1) $—Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $1 $— 1        $1The Company uses credit and other financial criteria to evaluate the credit standing of, and to select, counterparties to its derivative instruments.

See Note C for additional information regarding the Company's sale of EFS Midstream.22 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFinancial and Operating PerformanceThe Company's financial and operating performance for the second quarter of 2016 included the following highlights:•Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the second quarter of 2016 was $268 million ($1.63 per diluted share), as compared to net loss of $218 million ($1.46 per diluted share) for the second quarter of 2015. The primary components of the increase in the net loss attributable to common stockholders include:•a $55 million increase in DD&A expense, primarily attributable to the 18 percent increase in sales volumes and reductions in proved reserves as a result of the decline in commodity prices, partially offset by impairments of proved properties during 2015 and 2016, which reduced the carrying value of the Company's oil and gas properties;•a $32 million increase in net derivative losses, primarily as a result of changes in forward commodity prices and the Company's portfolio of derivatives;•a $14 million decrease in net margins attributable to purchases and sales of oil and gas used to fulfill transportation commitments; •a $10 million increase in interest expense, primarily related to the issuance of $500 million of 3.45% Senior Notes due 2021 and $500 million of 4.45% Senior Notes due 2026 in December 2015; and•a $9 million increase in other expense, primarily related to increases in unused firm transportation costs and the net loss from Company-provided fracture stimulation and related service operations that are provided to third party working interest owners, offset by decreases in idle drilling and well service equipment and restructuring charges; partially offset by•a $23 million decrease in total oil and gas production costs and production and ad valorem taxes, primarily due to the Company's cost saving initiatives and a 13 percent decrease in the average commodity prices per BOE; •a $20 million increase in the Company's income tax benefit as a result of the Company's larger loss from continuing operations before taxes; •a $17 million increase in oil and gas revenues as a result of the aforementioned 18 percent increase in sales volumes, partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in commodity prices; and•a $10 million decrease in exploration and abandonments expense, primarily due to the 2015 write-off of wells in southeast Colorado.•During the second quarter of 2016, average daily sales volumes from continuing operations increased by 18 percent to 232,703 BOEPD, as compared to 196,626 BOEPD during the second quarter of 2015. The increase in second quarter 2016 average daily sales volumes, as compared to the second quarter of 2015, is primarily due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program.•Average oil and gas prices decreased during the second quarter of 2016 to $41.43 per Bbl and $1.67 per Mcf, respectively, as compared to $51.64 per Bbl and $2.37 per Mcf, respectively, in the second quarter of 2015. Average NGL prices increased during the second quarter of 2016 to $14.21 per Bbl, as compared to $14.03 per Bbl in the second quarter of 2015.•Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $409 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $327 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The $82 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to reductions in operating costs and funds used to satisfy working capital obligations and increases in the Company's oil and gas revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as a result of increased sales volumes.•Issuance of 6.0 million shares of common stock during the second quarter of 2016 for net cash proceeds of $937 million.•As of June 30, 2016, the Company's net debt to book capitalization decreased to three percent, as compared to 21 percent at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the Company's issuances of common stock during 2016.Recent DevelopmentsAcquisition and drilling rig additions. In June 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire 28,000 net acres in the Permian Basin for $435 million (before normal closing adjustments), the majority of which is in the Company's core operating area. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of 2016. In conjunction with the 23 PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYacquisition and the Company's improved outlook for oil prices for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2017, the Company announced that it expects to increase its horizontal drilling rig count to 17 rigs (from 12 rigs that were originally planned) in the Permian Basin by the end of 2016. The Company's capital expenditures budget for 2016 has been increased by $100 million to $2.1 billion to fund the incremental drilling rig expenditures during 2016. The updated 2016 capital budget includes $1.95 billion for drilling and completions operations (includes tank batteries, salt water disposal facilities and gas processing facilities) and $150 million for water infrastructure, vertical integration, systems upgrades and field facilities. The additional drilling activity in 2016 is pad drilling, with the wells on the new pads expected to be placed on production in early 2017.EFS Midstream. In July 2016, the Company received a cash payment of $501 million from an unaffiliated third party to settle the outstanding note receivable that was reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. The note receivable represented a portion of the consideration received from the July 2015 sale of EFS Midstream.  Third Quarter 2016 OutlookBased on current estimates, the Company expects the following operating and financial results from continuing operations for the quarter ending September 30, 2016:Production is forecasted to average 232,000 to 237,000 BOEPD. Production costs (including production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs) are expected to average $8.25 to $10.25 per BOE based on current NYMEX strip commodity prices. DD&A expense is expected to average $17.50 to $19.50 per BOE.Total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $20 million to $30 million. General and administrative expense is expected to be $78 million to $83 million. Interest expense is expected to be $45 million to $50 million, and other expense is expected to be $65 million to $75 million. Other expense is expected to include (i) $7 million to $12 million for stacked drilling rig charges, (ii) $28 million to $33 million of charges associated with excess firm gathering and transportation commitments, (iii) $15 million to $20 million of losses (principally noncash) associated with the portion of vertical integration services provided to nonaffiliated working interest owners, including joint venture partners, in wells operated by the Company and (iv) other miscellaneous charges. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $4 million to $7 million.The Company's effective income tax rate is expected to range from 35 percent to 40 percent assuming current capital spending plans and no significant mark-to-market changes in the Company's derivative position. Current income taxes are expected to be $1 million to $5 million and are primarily attributable to state taxes.Operations and Drilling HighlightsThe following table summarizes the Company's average daily oil, NGL, gas and total production by asset area during the six months ended June 30, 2016:  Oil (Bbls) NGLs (Bbls) Gas (Mcf) Total (BOE)Permian Basin 109,702 26,315 131,938 158,007South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale 14,358 10,781 83,174 39,002Raton Basin — — 99,227 16,538West Panhandle 3,344 2,970 13,190 8,513South Texas - Other 1,355 160 22,027 5,186Other 3 1 41 10 Total  128,762 40,227 349,597 227,256The Company's total liquids production from continuing operations increased to 74 percent of total production, on a BOE basis, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to 69 percent for the same period last year. 24 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY The following table summarizes by geographic area the Company's finding and development costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016:   Acquisition Costs Exploration Development    Proved Unproved Costs Costs Total  (in millions)Permian Basin $2 $9 $662 $256 $929South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale — — 33 24 57West Panhandle — — 1 2 3South Texas - Other — — — 2 2Other — — 3 — 3 Total 2 $9 $699 $284 $994The following table summarizes the Company's development and exploration/extension drilling activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016:   Development Drilling  Beginning Wellsin Progress WellsSpud SuccessfulWells Ending Wellsin ProgressPermian Basin 27 10 31 6South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale 6 — 2 4 Total 33 10 33 10   Exploration/Extension Drilling  Beginning Wellsin Progress WellsSpud SuccessfulWells Ending Wellsin ProgressPermian Basin 77 108 97 88South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale 23 1 9 15Total 100 109 106 103Permian Basin area. In the first half of 2016, the Company reduced its rig count in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area from 18 rigs at year-end 2015 to 13 rigs at June 30, 2016. During the second half of 2016, the Company expects to increase the rig count in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area to 17 rigs. During 2016, the Company expects to complete approximately 230 horizontal wells (190 horizontal wells in the northern portion of the play and 40 horizontal wells in the southern portion of the play). Approximately 60 percent of the horizontal wells are planned to be drilled in the Wolfcamp B interval, 25 percent in the Wolfcamp A interval and 15 percent in the Lower Spraberry Shale interval. The Company continues to drill utilizing two-well and three-well pads and expects to spend $1.87 billion of drilling and completion capital in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field during 2016. During the first six months of 2016, the Company placed on production 91 horizontal wells in the northern portion of the play and 33 horizontal wells in the southern portion of the play. In the northern portion of the play, approximately 65 percent of the wells placed on production were Wolfcamp B interval wells, and the remaining 35 percent were split predominantly between Wolfcamp A interval wells and Lower Spraberry Shale wells. In the southern portion of the play, all of the wells placed on production were Wolfcamp B interval wells. The Company continues to utilize its integrated services to control well costs and operating costs in addition to supporting the execution of its drilling and production activities in the Spraberry field. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company utilized five Company-owned fracture stimulation fleets totaling approximately 330,000 horsepower to support its drilling operations in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp field. The Company idled three of its eight fracture stimulation fleets during the second quarter of 2016 due to reduced demand for fracture stimulation services as a result of the Company's reduced rig count. The Company also owns other field service equipment that supports its drilling and production operations, including pulling units, fracture stimulation tanks, water transport trucks, hot oilers, blowout preventers, construction equipment and fishing tools. In addition, Premier Silica (the Company's wholly-owned sand mining subsidiary) is supplying high-quality and logistically advantaged brown sand for proppant, which is being used by the Company to fracture stimulate horizontal wells in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp Shale intervals.25 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe Company has been and continues to aggressively pursue initiatives to improve drilling and completion efficiencies and reduce costs. The most significant drilling and completion cost reductions to date have been for casing, tubing, materials for drilling and fracture stimulation, fuel charges, labor and transportation, rental equipment and well services, while efficiency gains include optimizing completions in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp Shale intervals. The Company's long-term growth plan continues to be focused on optimizing the development of the field and addressing the future requirements for water, field infrastructure, gas processing, sand, pipeline takeaway, oilfield services, tubulars, electricity, buildings and roads. However, much of the Company's front-end loaded infrastructure plans, which were expected to provide significant future cost savings and support the Company's long-term growth plan in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area, have been minimized given the significant decline in oil prices. The Company plans to continue to evaluate its infrastructure plans for a field-wide water distribution network, additional gas processing facilities and expansion of Premier Silica's Brady sand mine based on the Company's outlook for commodity prices and/or incremental cost reductions.Eagle Ford Shale area. In the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas, the rig count has been reduced to zero rigs given current commodity prices that continue to adversely affect well returns. The Company plans to spend $60 million of capital in 2016 to complete 18 Eagle Ford Shale wells and add field compression to reduce wellhead pressures. Due to the reduction in drilling activity, the Company expects to continue to incur fees associated with unused firm transportation, gathering, processing, and fractionation commitments over the term of the obligations.In July 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its 50.1 percent interest in EFS Midstream to an unaffiliated third party, with the Company receiving total consideration of $1.0 billion, of which $530 million was received at closing and the remaining $501 million was in the form of a note, which was payable to the Company one year from closing. The note receivable was paid in full in July 2016. As a result of the sale, the Company no longer receives its share of the cash flow generated by EFS Midstream, which had the effect of increasing the Company's third-party transportation component of oil and gas production costs by approximately $0.75 per BOE. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company also extended the duration of its downstream processing and transportation contracts to 20 years, with improved terms. Results of Operations from Continuing OperationsOil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues totaled $613 million and $1.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $596 million and $1.1 billion for the same respective periods in 2015. The increase in oil and gas revenues during the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to 34 percent and 12 percent increases in daily oil and NGL sales volumes, respectively, partially offset by a four percent decline in daily gas sales volumes and declines of 20 percent and 30 percent in average oil and gas prices, respectively. The decrease in oil and gas revenues during the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, is primarily due to declines of 26 percent, 15 percent and 32 percent in average oil, NGL and gas prices, respectively, partially offset by 29 percent and 12 percent increases in daily oil and NGL volumes, respectively.The following table provides average daily sales volumes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:   Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2016 2015 2016 2015Oil (Bbls) 134,723 100,569 128,762 99,567NGLs (Bbls) 41,223 36,659 40,227 36,015Gas (Mcf) 340,542 356,391 349,597 357,901Total (BOEs) 232,703 196,626 227,256 195,232Average daily BOE sales volumes increased by 18 percent and 16 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2015, principally due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp horizontal drilling program. Production for both the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 reflects lower NGL production volumes of approximately 5,000 barrels per day due to voluntary reductions in recoveries of ethane since it had a higher value if sold as part of the gas stream. 26 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe oil, NGL and gas prices that the Company reports are based on the market prices received for each commodity. The following table provides the Company's average prices for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:   Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2016 2015 2016 2015Oil (per Bbl) $41.43 $51.64 $35.07 $47.40NGL (per Bbl) $14.21 $14.03 $12.32 $14.50Gas (per Mcf) $1.67 $2.37 $1.73 $2.53Total (per BOE) $28.95 $33.32 $24.72 $31.50Sales of purchased oil and gas. The Company periodically enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company’s areas of production. The Company enters into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to diversify a portion of the Company's WTI oil sales to a Gulf Coast oil price and to satisfy unused pipeline capacity commitments. Revenues and expenses from these transactions are presented on a gross basis as the Company acts as a principal in the transaction by assuming the risk and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, of the commodities purchased and assuming responsibility to deliver the commodities sold. The net effect of third party purchases and sales of oil and gas for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was a loss of $15 million and $35 million, respectively, as compared to a loss of $1 million and $6 million for the same respective periods in 2015. Firm transportation payments on excess pipeline capacity commitments are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information on transportation commitment charges. Interest and other income. Interest and other income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $6 million and $13 million, respectively, as compared to $7 million and $14 million for the same respective periods in 2015. See Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information.Derivative gains (losses), net. The Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded $229 million and $186 million of net derivative losses, respectively, on commodity price and interest rate derivatives, of which $132 million and $349 million represented net cash receipts, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded $197 million of net derivative losses and $44 million of net derivative gains, respectively, of which $150 million and $356 million represented net cash receipts, respectively.The following tables detail the net cash receipts on the Company's commodity derivatives and the relative price impact (per Bbl or Mcf) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:  Three Months Ended June 30, 2016Six Months Ended June 30, 2016  Net cash receipts Price impact Net cash receipts Price impact  (in millions)    (in millions)   Oil derivative receipts $110 $8.97per Bbl $303 $12.93per BblNGL derivative receipts 1 $0.19per Bbl 5 $0.63per BblGas derivative receipts 21 $0.68per Mcf 41 $0.65per McfTotal net commodity derivative receipts $132    $349   27 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY  Three Months Ended June 30, 2015Six Months Ended June 30, 2015  Net cash receipts Price impact Net cash receipts Price impact  (in millions)    (in millions)   Oil derivative receipts $118 $12.96per Bbl $299 $16.60per BblNGL derivative receipts 3 $0.85per Bbl 2 $0.29per BblGas derivative receipts 30 $0.91per Mcf 56 $0.87per McfTotal net commodity derivative receipts $151    $357   See Notes D and E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information regarding the Company's derivative activities and market risks associated with those activities. Gain on disposition of assets, net. The Company recorded net gains on the disposition of assets of $1 million and $3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $2 million and $3 million for the same respective periods in 2015. Oil and gas production costs. The Company recorded oil and gas production costs of $141 million and $297 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $163 million and $343 million during the same respective periods in 2015. Lease operating expenses and workover costs represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while third-party transportation charges represent the cost to transport volumes produced to a sales point. Net natural gas plant (income) charges represent the net costs to gather and process the Company's gas, reduced by net revenues earned from the gathering and processing of third-party gas in Company-owned facilities.Total oil and gas production costs per BOE for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 27 percent and 26 percent, as compared to the same respective periods in 2015. The decrease in lease operating expenses per BOE during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same respective periods in 2015, is primarily due to a greater proportion of the Company's production coming from horizontal wells in Spraberry/Wolfcamp area that have lower per BOE lease operating costs, cost reduction initiatives and lower electricity and fuel costs, which are impacted by lower commodity prices. The increase in third-party transportation charges reflects the Company no longer receiving cash flow generated by EFS Midstream as a result of its sale in July 2015. The decline in workover costs per BOE during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same respective periods in 2015, is primarily due to most workover activity being uneconomical as a result of the lower commodity price environment. The following table provides the components of the Company's oil and gas production costs per BOE for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:   Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2016 2015 2016 2015Lease operating expenses $4.95 $7.10 $5.20 $7.60Third-party transportation charges 1.47 1.30 1.61 1.28Net natural gas plant (income) charges (0.01) 0.08 0.11 0.19Workover costs 0.25 0.63 0.27 0.63Total production costs $6.66 $9.11 $7.19 $9.70Production and ad valorem taxes. The Company's production and ad valorem taxes were $36 million and $65 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $37 million and $76 million for the same respective periods in 2015. In general, production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, Texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. 28 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe following table provides the Company's production and ad valorem taxes per BOE for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:  Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2016 2015 2016 2015Production taxes $1.22 $1.38 $1.01 $1.30Ad valorem taxes 0.48 0.70 0.57 0.86Total production and ad valorem taxes $1.70 $2.08 $1.58$2.16Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company's DD&A expense was $384 million ($18.14 per BOE) and $737 million ($17.82 per BOE) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $329 million ($18.38 per BOE) and $639 million ($18.08 per BOE) during the same respective periods in 2015. The change in per BOE DD&A expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same respective periods in 2015, is primarily due to a decrease in depletion expense per BOE on oil and gas properties. Depletion expense on oil and gas properties was $17.62 and $17.29 per BOE during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $17.75 and $17.45 per BOE during the same respective periods in 2015. An extended commodity price decline could adversely affect the amount of oil, NGLs and gas that the Company can economically produce, which could result in the Company having to make downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves. Reductions in estimated proved reserves could increase the amount of depletion expense the Company recognizes as a result of shortening the economic productive lives of the Company's producing wells.Impairment of oil and gas properties. The Company performs assessments of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. To the extent such assessments indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of the Company's oil and gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore an impairment charge would be required to reduce the carrying value of the proved properties to their fair value.The cash flow model the Company uses to assess proved properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows are (i) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (ii) results of future drilling activities, (iii) Management's Price Outlook and (iv) increases or decreases in production costs and capital costs associated with those reserves. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each measurement date.As a result of the Company's proved property impairment assessments, the Company recognized pretax, noncash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of (i) its West Panhandle Field during the three months ended March 31, 2016 ($32 million impairment charge) and (ii) the Eagle Ford Shale field ($846 million impairment charge), the West Panhandle field ($138 million impairment charge) and the South Texas - Other field ($72 million impairment charge) during the year ended December 31, 2015 to their estimated fair values. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the Company's proved oil and gas property impairment charges.Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the Company's geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes expenses and lease abandonments and other exploration expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):   Three Months EndedJune 30, Six Months EndedJune 30,  2016 2015 2016 2015Geological and geophysical $17 $18 $37 $38Exploratory dry holes — 10 — 15Leasehold abandonments and other 1 — 40 1  $18 $28 $77 $54During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred leasehold abandonments primarily related to the abandonment of unproved properties in the Permian Basin and unproved acreage in Alaska in which the Company held an overriding royalty interest. 29 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYDuring the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company drilled and evaluated 106 exploration/extension wells, all of which were successfully completed as discoveries. During the same period in 2015, the Company drilled and evaluated 96 exploration/extension wells, 94 of which were successfully completed as discoveries.General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $80 million ($3.77 per BOE) and $154 million ($3.72 per BOE), respectively, as compared to $83 million ($4.65 per BOE) and $165 million ($4.68 per BOE) for the same respective periods in 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same respective periods in 2015, was primarily due to the Company's cost reduction initiatives, including not replacing personnel who have left the Company and reduced contractor activity.Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations was $5 million and $9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $3 million and $6 million for the same respective periods in 2015. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for information regarding the Company's asset retirement obligations. Interest expense. Interest expense was $56 million and $111 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $46 million and $92 million for the same respective periods in 2015. The increase in interest expense during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same respective periods in 2015, was primarily due to the Company's December 2015 issuance of $500 million of 3.45% Senior Notes due 2021 and $500 million of 4.45% Senior Notes due 2026. The weighted average interest rate on the Company's indebtedness for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, including the effects of capitalized interest, was 5.7 percent, as compared to 6.4 percent and 6.8 percent for the same respective periods in 2015. Other expense. Other expense was $67 million and $154 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $58 million and $107 million during the same respective periods in 2015. The increase in other expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same respective periods in 2015, is primarily due to increases in (i) unused firm transportation costs, (ii) the net loss recognized from Company-provided fracture stimulation and related service operations that are provided to third party working interest owners and (iii) terminated rig contract charges, partially offset by decreases in (iv) restructuring charges and (v) idle drilling and well service equipment charges. The Company expects to continue to incur idle drilling rig charges for the remainder of 2016. Based on current drilling plans for 2017, only minimal, if any, stacked rig charges will be incurred. The Company also expects to continue to incur charges associated with excess firm gathering and transportation commitments and vertical integration operations until commodity prices improve, allowing the Company to increase its drilling activities, or, in the case of the gathering and transportation commitments, the contractual obligations expire. See Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information. Income tax benefit. The Company recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of $143 million and $284 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to income tax benefits of $123 million and $160 million for the same respective periods in 2015. The Company's effective tax rate for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was 35 percent, as compared to 36 percent and 35 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company did not have any discontinued operations activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company reported net losses from discontinued operations of $1 million and $4 million, respectively. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and LiquidityCapital commitments. The Company's primary needs for cash are for capital expenditures and acquisition expenditures on oil and gas properties and related vertical integration assets and facilities, payment of contractual obligations, including debt maturities, dividends and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, cash and cash equivalents on hand, sales of investments in commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits that are classified as short-term and long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, proceeds from divestitures or external financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" below.The Company's capital budget for 2016 is $2.1 billion (excluding acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs), which includes approximately $1.95 billion for drilling operations and $150 million for water infrastructure, vertical integration, system upgrades and field facilities. The Company's capital 30 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYexpenditures during the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $1.1 billion, consisting of $948 million for drilling operations (excluding acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs) and $118 million for water infrastructure, vertical integration and other plant and equipment additions. Based on results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and Management's Price Outlook, the Company expects its net cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, the receipt of the remaining $501 million of proceeds from the EFS Midstream divestiture (received in July 2016), sales of short-term and long-term investments and, if necessary, availability under the Credit Facility to be sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures, acquisitions and contractual obligations for the remainder of 2016 and 2017. Investing activities. Investing activities used $2.6 billion of cash during the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $1.2 billion of cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, is primarily due to the purchase of $1.5 billion of investment securities (commercial paper, corporate bonds and time deposits), partially offset by a $112 million decrease in additions to oil and gas properties. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company's expenditures for investing activities were primarily funded by net cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and the Company's issuance of 19.8 million shares of common stock during the the first half of 2016 for cash proceeds of $2.5 billion.Dividends/distributions. During March of 2016 and 2015, the Board declared semiannual dividends of $0.04 per common share. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, and, if declared, the Board may change the current dividend amount based on the Company's liquidity and capital resources at the time. Contractual obligations, including off-balance sheet obligations. The Company's contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments (primarily related to commitments to pay day rates for contracted drilling rigs), capital funding obligations, derivative obligations, firm transportation and fractionation commitments, minimum annual gathering, processing and transportation commitments and other liabilities (including postretirement benefit obligations). From time-to-time, the Company enters into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of June 30, 2016, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company had entered into included (i) operating lease agreements, (ii) drilling commitments, (iii) firm purchase, transportation and fractionation commitments, (iv) open purchase commitments and (v) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable. The contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable include (i) derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices or interest rates, (ii) gathering, processing (primarily treating and fractionation) and transportation commitments on uncertain volumes of future throughput, (iii) open delivery commitments and (iv) indemnification obligations following certain divestitures. In addition, in June 2016, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire 28,000 net acres in the Permian Basin for $435 million. The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter of 2016. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other parties that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. There were no material changes to the Company's contractual obligations during the second quarter of 2016.The Company's commodity and interest rate derivative contracts are periodically measured and recorded at fair value and continue to be subject to market or credit risk. As of June 30, 2016, these contracts represented net assets of $234 million. The ultimate liquidation value of the Company's commodity and interest rate derivatives will be dependent upon actual future commodity prices and interest rates, which may differ materially from the inputs used to determine the derivatives' fair values as of June 30, 2016. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information about the Company's derivative instruments and market risk.Capital resources. The Company's primary capital resources are cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from divestitures and proceeds from financing activities (principally borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility or issuances of debt or equity securities). If internal cash flows do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may reduce its level of capital expenditures, and/or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using cash on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments, availability under its Credit Facility, issuances of debt or equity securities or obtain capital from other sources, such as through sales of nonstrategic assets. Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $521 million, as compared to $432 million during the same period in 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, is primarily due to reductions in operating costs and funds used to satisfy working capital obligations, partially offset by decreases in the Company's oil and gas revenues between periods as a result of declines in commodity prices.31 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYFinancing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2.5 billion, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $32 million during the same period in 2015. The change to net cash provided by financing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to the same period of 2015, is primarily the result of the Company's issuance of 19.8 million shares of common stock during the the first half of 2016 for cash proceeds of $2.5 billion.As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The Company cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of any such actions as they are subject to market conditions, among other factors. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Board. Liquidity. The Company's principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments and unused borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its Credit Facility, leaving $1.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of June 30, 2016. The Company also had cash on hand of $1.8 billion, short-term investments of $1.5 billion and long-term investments of $23 million as of June 30, 2016. If internal cash flows do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may reduce its level of capital expenditures, reduce dividend payments, and/or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using cash on hand, sales of short-term and long-term investments, availability under its Credit Facility, issuances of debt or equity securities or other sources, such as sales of nonstrategic assets. The Company cannot provide any assurance that needed short-term or long-term liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Although the Company expects that the combination of internal operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents on hand, the receipt of the remaining $501 million of proceeds from the EFS Midstream divestiture (received in July 2016), sales of short-term and long-term investments and, if necessary, available capacity under the Company's Credit Facility will be adequate to fund planned 2016 and 2017 capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and provide adequate liquidity to fund other needs, including debt maturities, no assurances can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Company's future needs.Debt ratings. The Company is rated as investment grade by three credit rating agencies. The Company receives debt credit ratings from several of the major ratings agencies, which are subject to regular reviews. The Company believes that each of the rating agencies considers many factors in determining the Company's ratings including: (i) production growth opportunities, (ii) liquidity, (iii) debt levels, (iv) asset composition and (v) proved reserve mix. A reduction in the Company's debt ratings could increase the interest rates that the Company incurs on Credit Facility borrowings and could negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. Book capitalization and current ratio. The Company's net book capitalization at June 30, 2016 was $10.7 billion, consisting of $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments of $1.5 billion, debt of $3.7 billion and equity of $10.4 billion. The Company's net debt to net book capitalization decreased to three percent at June 30, 2016 from 21 percent at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the Company's issuance of 19.8 million shares of common stock during the the first half of 2016 for cash proceeds of $2.5 billion. The Company's ratio of current assets to current liabilities increased to 2.57 to 1.00 at June 30, 2016, as compared to 2.19 to 1.00 at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the aforementioned issuance of common stock during the first half of 2016, partially offset by the reclassification of the Company's 6.65% Senior Notes due in March 2017 to a current liability. New accounting pronouncements. The effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements."32 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe following quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are supplementary to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures provided in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As such, the information contained herein should be read in conjunction with the related disclosures in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company's potential exposure to market risks. The term "market risks," insofar as it relates to currently anticipated transactions of the Company, refers to the risk of loss arising from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. These disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators regarding how the Company views and manages ongoing market risk exposures. None of the Company's market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for speculative purposes.The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Company's open derivative contracts during the six months ending June 30, 2016:  Derivative Contract Net Assets  Commodities Interest Rates Total  (in millions)Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2015 $757 $— $757Changes in contract fair value (177) (9) (186)Contract maturity receipts (349) — (349)Payments associated with entering new contracts 12 — 12Fair value of contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2016 $243 $(9) $234Interest rate sensitivity. See Note G of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity included in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information regarding the Company's long-term debt.33 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe following table provides information about financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of June 30, 2016 and that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents debt maturities by expected maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given current contractual terms and market conditions and the debt's estimated fair value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of June 30, 2016. Although the Company had no outstanding variable rate debt as of June 30, 2016, the average variable contractual rates for its credit facility projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on July 25, 2016 is presented in the table below.

(c)The variable rate receivable represents the July 25, 2016 forecasted three-month LIBOR rate for the 10-year period from December 2017 through December 2027.Commodity derivative instruments and price sensitivity. The following table provides information about the Company's oil, NGL and gas derivative financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil, NGL and gas prices as of June 30, 2016. Although mitigated by the Company's derivative activities, declines in oil, NGL and gas prices would reduce the Company's revenues.The Company manages commodity price risk with derivative contracts, such as swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short put options. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide minimum ("floor" or "long put") and maximum ("ceiling") prices on a notional amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price. Collar contracts with short put options differ from other collar contracts by virtue of the short put option price, below which the Company's realized price will exceed the variable market prices by the long put-to-short put price differential.See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for a description of the accounting procedures followed by the Company for its derivative financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of the Company's derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil, NGL or gas prices.34 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY 2016  Year Ending December 31, Asset (Liability) Fair Value at June 30, Third Quarter Fourth Quarter  2017 2018 2016 (a)          (in millions)Oil Derivatives:          Average daily notional Bbl volumes:          Collar contracts— —  6,000 — $10Weighted average ceiling price per BBL$— $—  $70.40 $—  Weighted average floor price per BBL$— $—  $50.00 $—  Collar contracts with short puts (b)112,000 112,000  75,000 — $227Weighted average ceiling price per Bbl$75.94 $75.94  $61.72 $—  Weighted average floor price per Bbl$65.41 $65.41  $49.62 $—  Weighted average short put price per Bbl$47.03 $47.03  $41.41 $—  Average forward NYMEX oil prices (c)$43.13 $44.60  $48.07 $—  NGL Derivatives:          Average daily notional Bbl volumes:          Propane swap contracts (d)7,500 7,500  — — $(2)Weighted average fixed price per Bbl$21.57 $21.57  $— $—  Average forward propane prices (c)$19.65 $21.05  $— $—  Ethane collar contracts (e)— —  3,000 — $(2)Weighted average ceiling price per Bbl$— $—  $11.83 $—  Weighted average floor price per Bbl$— $—  $8.68 $—  Average forward ethane prices (c)$— $—  $11.45 $—  Ethane basis swap contracts (MMBtu) (f)2,768 2,768  — — $—Weighted average fixed price per MMBtu$0.91 $0.91  $— $—  Average forward basis differential prices (g)$0.32 $0.57  $— $—  Gas Derivatives:          Average daily notional MMBtu volumes:          Swap contracts70,000 70,000  — — $13Weighted average fixed price per MMBtu$4.06 $4.06  $— $—  Collar contracts with short puts (h)180,000 180,000  80,000 50,000 $(2)Weighted average ceiling price per MMBtu$4.01 $4.01  $3.15 $3.40  Weighted average floor price per MMBtu$3.24 $3.24  $2.75 $2.75  Weighted average short put price per MMBtu$2.78 $2.78  $2.35 $2.25  Average forward NYMEX gas prices (c)$2.73 $2.96  $3.13 $3.02  Basis swap contracts         $(1)Gulf Coast index swap contracts (i)10,000 10,000  — —  Weighted average fixed price per MMBtu$— $—  $— $—  Average forward basis differential prices (g)$(0.04) $(0.06)  $— $—  Mid-Continent index swap contracts (i)15,000 15,000  45,000 —  Weighted average fixed price per MMBtu$(0.32) $(0.32)  $(0.32) $—  Average forward basis differential prices (g)$(0.26) $(0.14)  $(0.21) $—  Permian Basin index swap contracts (j)— 34,946  9,863 —  Weighted average fixed price per MMBtu$— $0.41  $0.37 $—  Average forward basis differential prices (k)$— $0.21  $0.16 $—   ___________________(a)In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 210-20 and ASC 815-10, the Company classifies the fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities executed under master netting arrangements as net derivative assets or net derivative liabilities, as the case may be.

Associated with these marketing arrangements, the Company may enter into index swaps to mitigate price risk. As of June 30, 2016, the Company did not have any marketing derivatives outstanding. 36 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYItem 4. Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Company's management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 37 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYPART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal ProceedingsThe Company is party to various proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to these proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. Item 1A. Risk FactorsIn addition to the information set forth in this Report, the risks that are discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, under the headings "Part I, Item 1.
