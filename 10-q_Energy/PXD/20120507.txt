Item 1A. Risk Factors  In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K under the headings “Part I Item 1. Business – Competition, Markets and Regulations,” “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” which risks could materially affect the Company’s business, financial condition or future results. Except as set forth below, there has been no material change in the Company’s risk factors from those described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company’s sand mining operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond the Company’s control, and such risks may not be covered by insurance.  Ownership of industrial sand mining operations are subject to risks, many of which are beyond the Company’s control. These risks include:        •    unusual or unexpected geological formations or pressures;        •    cave-ins, pit wall failures or rock falls;        •    unanticipated ground, grade or water conditions;        •    inclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of climate change;        •    environmental hazards;        •    changes in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof);        •    inability to acquire or maintain necessary permits or mining or water rights;        •    restrictions on blasting operations;        •    inability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts;        •    reduction in the amount of water available for processing;        •    technical difficulties or failures;        •    labor disputes;        •    late delivery of supplies; and        •    fires, explosions or other accidents  Any of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, the Company’s mining properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses or possible legal liability. Not all of these risks are insurable, and the Company’s insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles, exclusions and endorsements. The Company’s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet its needs in the event of loss and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The Company’s estimates of mineral reserves and resource deposits are imprecise and actual reserves could be less than estimated.  The Company bases its mineral reserve and resource estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by engineers and geologists, which are reviewed by outside firms. However, commercial sand reserve estimates are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of commercial sand reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond the Company’s control. Estimates of economically recoverable commercial sand reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:        •    geological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;    47    Table of Contents PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY        •    assumptions concerning future prices of commercial sand products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and        •    assumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.  The Company’s sand mining operations are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety regulations that impose significant costs and potential liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.  The Company’s sand mining operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulatory environmental requirements affecting the mining and mineral processing industry, including among others, those relating to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air and water emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, waste management, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use, reclamation and restoration of properties, hazardous materials and natural resources. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for noncompliance, and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances. Failure to properly handle, transport, store or dispose of hazardous materials or otherwise conduct the Company’s sand mining operations in compliance with environmental laws could expose the Company to liability for governmental penalties, cleanup costs and civil or criminal liability associated with releases of such materials into the environment, damages to property or natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair the Company’s ability to conduct its sand mining operations. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict the Company’s ability to expand its facilities or extract mineral deposits or could require the Company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with its sand mining operations. Future events, including changes in any environmental requirements (or their interpretation or enforcement) and the costs associated with complying with such requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s sand mining operations.  Any failure by the Company to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in connection with its sand mining operations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that could adversely impact the Company, including:        •    issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;        •    denial, modification or revocation of permits or other authorizations;        •    imposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on the Company’s operations, including cessation of operations; and        •    requirements to perform site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.  In addition to environmental regulation, the Company’s sand mining operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration, may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment.  The Company’s sand mining operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of the Company’s sand mining operations.  The Company’s sand mining operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, which imposes stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters. The Company’s failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s sand mining operations or otherwise impose significant restrictions on the Company’s ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.    48    Table of Contents PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY    The Company’s sand mining operations are subject to extensive other regulations, including licensing, plant and wildlife protection and reclamation regulation, that impose significant costs and liabilities.  In addition to the health, safety and environmental regulation discussed above, the Company’s sand mining operations are also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, and the effects that mining have on groundwater quality and availability. In addition, the Company’s sand mining operations require numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each sand mining facility.  In order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future for its sand mining operations, the Company may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the impact that any such activities may have on the environment. Obtaining or renewing required permits may be delayed or prevented due to opposition by neighboring property owners, members of the public or other third parties, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s sand mining operations at the affected facility. Current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s sand mining operations and the Company may not be able to renew or obtain permits in the future.  The Company’s sand mining operations entail silica-related health issues and litigation that could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the commercial sand industry. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling sand could materially and adversely affect the Company through the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits and increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities.  Premier Silica is named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous products liability lawsuits brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of Premier Silica’s customers alleging damages caused by silica exposure. As of May 1, 2012, Premier Silica was the subject of approximately 2,500 silica exposure claims, the great majority of which have been inactive for many years due to the plaintiffs’ failure to meet specific legal requirements to advance their claims. Almost all of the claims pending against Premier Silica arise out of the alleged use of Premier Silica’s sand products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Florida and West Virginia, although some cases have been brought in many other jurisdictions over the years.    49    Table of Contents PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY    It is possible that Premier Silica will continue to have silica-related products liability claims filed against it, including claims that allege silica exposure for periods for which there is not insurance coverage. Any pending or future claims or inadequacies of insurance coverage or indemnification from the seller could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.  These risks are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or future results.
