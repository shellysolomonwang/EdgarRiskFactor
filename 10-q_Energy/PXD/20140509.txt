Organization and Nature of OperationsPioneer Natural Resources Company ("Pioneer" or the "Company") is a Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Company is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production company operating in the United States, with continuing field operations primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale play in South Texas, the Raton field in southeastern Colorado, the Hugoton field in southwest Kansas and the West Panhandle field in the Texas Panhandle. NOTE B. Basis of PresentationPresentation. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of March 31, 2014 and for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 include all adjustments and accruals, consisting only of normal, recurring accrual adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods. These interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") have been condensed in or omitted from this report pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). These consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2013 financial statement and footnote amounts in order to conform to the 2014 presentation. New accounting pronouncements. In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-08, "Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity." ASU 2014-08 prospectively changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures around disposals of assets whether or not the disposal meets the definition of a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2014 with early adoption permitted but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. The adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.NOTE C. Acquisitions and Divestitures Divestitures Recorded in Continuing OperationsThe Company recorded net gains on disposition of assets in continuing operations of $6 million and $24 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which were primarily comprised of the following:•Vertical drilling rigs. During December 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell the Company's majority interest in Sendero Drilling Company, LLC ("Sendero") to Sendero's minority interest owner. At December 31, 2013, the assets and liabilities of Sendero were classified as held for sale at their estimated fair value. In March 2014, the Company completed the sale of Sendero for cash proceeds of $31 million and recognized a gain of $1 million associated with the completion of the sale during the three months ended March 31, 2014. As part of the sales agreement, the Company committed to lease from Sendero 12 vertical rigs through December 31, 2015, and eight vertical rigs in 2016.•Permian Basin. During February 2014, the Company completed the sale of proved and unproved properties in Gaines and Dawson counties in the Spraberry field in West Texas for net cash proceeds of $68 million, which resulted in a gain of $3 million. •West Panhandle. During the first quarter of 2013, the Company completed a sale of its interest in unproved oil and gas properties adjacent to the Company's West Panhandle field operations for net cash proceeds of $38 million, which resulted in a gain of $22 million.10 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2014(Unaudited)Divestitures Recorded as Discontinued OperationsAlaska. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell 100 percent of the capital stock in Pioneer's Alaska subsidiary ("Pioneer Alaska"). In April 2014, the Company completed the sale of Pioneer Alaska to an unaffiliated third party pursuant to an amended purchase and sale agreement for $300 million before normal closing and other adjustments. The Company has classified (i) Pioneer Alaska's assets and liabilities as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and (ii) Pioneer Alaska's results of operations as income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.Based upon the provisions in the amended purchase and sale agreement for Pioneer Alaska, the Company recorded an additional noncash impairment charge of $97 million in discontinued operations during the three months ended March 31, 2014 to reduce the carrying value of Pioneer Alaska to its sales value, including normal closing adjustments, of $253 million. See Note D for additional information about the Pioneer Alaska impairment charge.Barnett Shale.  During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to divest of its net assets in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. The plan is expected to result in the sale of the Barnett Shale net assets during 2014. The Company has classified its (i) Barnett Shale assets and liabilities as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and (ii) Barnett Shale results of operations as income from discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.Due to reductions in the fair value of the Barnett Shale net assets, primarily due to cash flow received during the first quarter, an additional impairment charge of $14 million was recorded in discontinued operations during the three months ended March 31, 2014. See Note D for additional information about the Barnett Shale impairment charge.The Company continues to pursue the sale of its Barnett Shale net assets. No assurance can be given that the sale will be completed in accordance with the Company's plans.11 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2014(Unaudited)The following table represents the components of the Company's discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:  Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2014 2013 (in millions)Revenues and other income:    Oil and gas $68 $60Interest and other (a) 29 19  97 79Costs and expenses:    Oil and gas production 18 20Production and ad valorem taxes 3 3Depletion, depreciation and amortization — 19Impairment of oil and gas properties 111 —Exploration and abandonments 1 10General and administrative 2 2Other 3 —  138 54Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes (41) 25Current tax provision — (1)Deferred tax (provision) benefit 15 (8)Income (loss) from discontinued operations $(26) $16 ____________________(a)Primarily comprised of cash received associated with Alaskan Petroleum Production Tax ("PPT") credits on qualifying capital expenditures.

Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based upon inputs that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability, which are characterized according to a hierarchy that prioritizes those inputs based on the degree to which they are observable. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources, whereas unobservable inputs reflect a company's own market assumptions, which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort. The three input levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:•Level 1 – quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.•Level 2 – quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates) and inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.•Level 3 – unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  The fair value input hierarchy level to which an asset or liability measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2014 for each of the fair value hierarchy levels:   Fair Value Measurement at the End of theReporting Period Using    Quoted Pricesin ActiveMarkets forIdenticalAssets(Level 1) SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level 2) SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3) Fair Value at March 31, 2014  (in millions)Recurring fair value measurements        Assets:        Commodity derivatives $— $95 $— $95Interest rate derivatives — 10 —10Deferred compensation plan assets 67 — — 67Total assets 67 105 — 172Liabilities:        Commodity derivatives — 42 — 42Interest rate derivatives — 4 — 4Total liabilities — 46 — 46Total recurring fair value measurements $67 $59 $— $126Deferred compensation plan assets. The Company's deferred compensation plan assets represent investments in equity and mutual fund securities that are actively traded on major exchanges. These investments are measured based on observable prices on major exchanges. As of March 31, 2014, the significant inputs to these asset values represented Level 1 independent active exchange market price inputs. Commodity derivatives. The Company's commodity derivatives represent oil, natural gas liquids ("NGL") and gas swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts. The asset and liability measurements for the Company's commodity derivative contracts represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow and option-pricing models for valuing its commodity derivatives.13 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2014(Unaudited)The asset and liability values attributable to the Company's commodity derivatives were determined based on inputs that include (i) the contracted notional volumes, (ii) independent active market price quotes, (iii) the applicable estimated credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve and (iv) the implied rate of volatility inherent in the collar and collar contracts with short puts, which is based on active and independent market-quoted volatility factors.Interest rate derivatives. The Company's interest rate derivatives as of March 31, 2014 represent interest rate swap contracts. The Company utilizes discounted cash flow models for valuing its interest rate derivatives. The net derivative values attributable to the Company's interest rate derivative contracts as of March 31, 2014 are based on (i) the contracted notional amounts, (ii) active market-quoted London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") yield curves and (iii) the applicable credit-adjusted risk-free rate yield curve. The Company's interest rate derivative asset measurements represent Level 2 inputs in the hierarchy.Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances. These assets and liabilities can include inventory, proved and unproved oil and gas properties that are written down to fair value when they are impaired and assets and liabilities associated with long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale. Assets classified as held for sale.  The Company records assets and liabilities associated with long-lived assets that are classified as held for sale at the lower of the asset's net carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell. The fair value of Pioneer Alaska is based on the sales price, as adjusted for normal closing adjustments, less costs to sell. The fair value of the Barnett Shale field assets is based upon a weighted average calculation that uses management inputs including an estimated sales price and a discounted cash flow model for the proved properties using Level 3 assumptions including management's longer-term commodity price outlooks ("Management's Price Outlooks") for (i) oil and gas prices of $81.58 per barrel ("BBL") for oil and $4.64 per million British thermal units ("MMBTU") for gas, (ii) production costs, (iii) capital expenditures, (iv) production and (v) estimated proved reserves. Management's commodity price outlooks represent longer-term outlooks that are developed based on third-party futures price outlooks as of a measurement date. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine estimated fair value. See Note C for additional information regarding the Company's planned divestitures.The following table presents the estimated fair value less costs to sell as of March 31, 2014 and fair value adjustments for the Company's assets classified as discontinued operations held for sale for the three months ended March 31, 2014:  Estimated Fair Value Less Costs to Sell Fair Value Adjustment  (in millions)Alaska $253 $(97)Barnett Shale field $208 $(14)Financial instruments not carried at fair value. Carrying values and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 are as follows:   March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013  CarryingValue FairValue CarryingValue FairValue  (in millions)Long-term debt $2,706 $3,121 $2,653 $3,019Long-term debt includes the Company's credit facility and the Company's senior notes. The fair value of debt is determined utilizing inputs that are Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy.Credit facility. The fair value of the Company's credit facility is calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on (i) forecasted contractual interest and fee payments, (ii) forward active market-quoted United States Treasury Bill rates and (iii) the applicable credit-adjustments.14 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2014(Unaudited)Senior notes. The Company's senior notes represent debt securities that are traded on major exchanges but are not actively traded. The fair values of the Company's senior notes are based on their periodic values as quoted on the major exchanges.The Company has other financial instruments consisting primarily of cash equivalents, receivables, prepaid expenses, payables and other current assets and liabilities that approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and their relatively short maturities. Non-financial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value include certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, goodwill and asset retirement obligations.NOTE E. Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells or consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. The Company also, from time to time, utilizes interest rate contracts to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company's indebtedness. Oil production derivative activities. All material physical sales contracts governing the Company's oil production are tied directly to, or are highly correlated with, New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") oil prices. The Company uses derivative contracts to manage oil price volatility and basis swap contracts to reduce basis risk between NYMEX prices and actual index prices at which the oil is sold.The following table sets forth the volumes per day associated with the Company's outstanding oil derivative contracts as of March 31, 2014 and the weighted average oil prices for those contracts:   Nine Months Ending December 31, Year Ending December 31,  2014 2015 2016Collar contracts with short puts:      Volume (BBL) (a) 69,000 86,500 25,000Price per BBL:      Ceiling $114.05 $99.01 $93.30Floor $93.70 $88.09 $85.00Short put $77.61 $73.18 $70.00Swap contracts:      Volume (BBL) 10,000 — —Price per BBL $93.87 $— $—Rollfactor swap contracts:      Volume (BBL) 9,455 5,000 —NYMEX roll price (b) $1.08 $0.60 $— ____________________(a)Counterparties have the option to extend for an additional year 1,500 BBLs per day of 2015 collar contracts with short puts with a ceiling price of $100.25 per BBL, a floor price of $90.00 per BBL and a short put price of $80.00 per BBL. The option to extend is exercisable on December 31, 2015.

All of the Company's derivatives are accounted for as non-hedge derivatives and therefore all changes in the fair values of its derivative contracts are recognized as gains or losses in the earnings of the periods in which they occur. The Company classifies the fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities as net current or noncurrent derivative assets or net current or noncurrent derivative liabilities, whichever the case may be, by commodity and counterparty. The Company enters into derivatives under master netting arrangements, which, in an event of default, allows the Company to offset payables to and receivables from the defaulting counterparty. 17 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2014(Unaudited)The aggregate fair value of the Company's derivative instruments reported in the consolidated balance sheets by type and counterparty, including the classification between current and noncurrent assets and liabilities, consists of the following: Fair Value of Derivative Instruments as of March 31, 2014Type Consolidated Balance SheetLocation FairValue Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Fair Value Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet    (in millions)Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      Asset Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $46 $(13) $33Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - current $10 $— 10Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $67 $(5) 62Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $12 $(12) —        $105Liability Derivatives:     Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $54 $(13) $41Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $6 $(5) 1Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $16 $(12) 4        $46Fair Value of Derivative Instruments as of December 31, 2013Type Consolidated Balance SheetLocation FairValue Gross Amounts Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Net Fair Value Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet    (in millions)Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments      Asset Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $73 $(7) $66Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - current $10 $— 10Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $95 $(4) 91Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $15 $(15) —        $167Liability Derivatives:      Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - current $19 $(7) $12Commodity price derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $4 $(4) —Interest rate derivatives Derivatives - noncurrent $25 $(15) 10        $22The Company uses credit and other financial criteria to evaluate the credit standing of, and to select, counterparties to its derivative instruments.

Exploratory CostsThe Company capitalizes exploratory well and project costs until a determination is made that the well or project has either found proved reserves, is impaired or is sold. The Company's capitalized exploratory well and project costs are presented in proved properties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. If the exploratory well or project is determined to be impaired, the impaired costs are charged to exploration and abandonments expense.The following table reflects the Company's capitalized exploratory well and project activity during the three months ended March 31, 2014: Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 (in millions)Beginning capitalized exploratory costs$159Additions to exploratory costs pending the determination of proved reserves307Reclassification due to determination of proved reserves(210)Impairment of properties(7)Exploratory well costs charged to exploration expense(1)Ending capitalized exploratory costs (a)$248_______________(a)Includes $60 million of capitalized exploratory well costs classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2014.The following table provides an aging, as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, of capitalized exploratory costs and the number of projects for which exploratory costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year based on the date drilling was completed: March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 (in millions, except project counts)Capitalized exploratory costs that have been suspended:   One year or less$211 $116More than one year37 43 $248 $159    Number of projects with exploratory costs that have been suspended for a period greater than one year1 1Alaska - Nuna.  The Company's Nuna project, which had $37 million of suspended project costs as of March 31, 2014, includes the Nuna-1 exploration well that was drilled during 2012 to test the Torok formation and a second appraisal well that was drilled and logged during the first quarter of 2013. The Company flow-tested the Nuna-1 well during the second quarter of 2012 and again in the first quarter of 2013. The second appraisal well encountered a mechanical problem and could not be flow-tested 19 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2014(Unaudited)before the end of the winter drilling season. The results of the flow tests on the Nuna-1 well and the log data from the second Nuna well were both very encouraging. Prior to the sale of Pioneer Alaska, the Company was conducting a front-end engineering design study to evaluate the potential for onshore production facilities to support the project. The capitalized exploratory well costs associated with the Nuna project are classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2014. See Note C for additional information about the Company's sale of Pioneer Alaska.NOTE G. Long-term DebtThe Company's long-term debt consists of senior notes and a revolving corporate credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), including the effects of net deferred fair value hedge losses and issuance discounts.

As of March 31, 2014, the Company had $50 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.NOTE H. Incentive PlansStock-based compensation For the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Company recorded $31 million of stock-based compensation expense for all plans, as compared to $28 million for the same period of 2013. As of March 31, 2014, there was $211 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based compensation plan awards, including $57 million attributable to stock-based awards that are expected to be settled on their vesting date in cash, rather than in equity shares ("Liability Awards"). The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized over the remaining vesting periods of the awards, which is a period of less than three years on a weighted average basis. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, accounts payable – due to affiliates includes $8 million and $33 million, respectively, of liabilities attributable to Liability Awards.

Commitments and ContingenciesThe Company is a party to proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any, ultimately incurred with respect to such proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position as a whole or on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. The Company records reserves for contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.Settlement of Lawsuit relating to the Pioneer Southwest merger.  On May 15, 2013, David Flecker, a purported unitholder of Pioneer Southwest, filed a class action petition on behalf of Pioneer Southwest's unitholders and a derivative suit (the "Flecker Lawsuit") on behalf of Pioneer Southwest against the Company, Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. ("Pioneer USA"), Pioneer Natural Resources GP LLC (the "General Partner") and the directors of the General Partner, in the 134th Judicial District of Dallas County, Texas (the "Court"). A similar class action petition and derivative suit was filed against the same defendants on May 20, 2013, in the 160th Judicial District of Dallas County, Texas, by purported unitholder Vipul Patel (the "Patel Lawsuit"). On September 3, 2013, the Patel Lawsuit was consolidated into the Flecker Lawsuit (as consolidated, the "Pioneer Southwest Lawsuit"), and the plaintiffs filed a consolidated derivative and class action petition on September 5, 2013.The Pioneer Southwest Lawsuit alleged, among other things, that the director defendants: (i) engaged in self-dealing, failed to act in good faith toward Pioneer Southwest, and breached their duties owed to Pioneer Southwest; (ii) failed to properly value Pioneer Southwest and its various assets and operations and ignored or failed to protect against the numerous conflicts of interest arising out of the proposed transaction; and (iii) breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by engaging in a flawed merger process. The lawsuit also alleged that the Company, Pioneer USA and the General Partner aided and abetted the director defendants in their purported breach of fiduciary duties. Based on these allegations, the plaintiffs sought to have the Pioneer Southwest merger rescinded. The plaintiffs also sought money damages and attorneys' fees.In September 2013, representatives of the plaintiffs and the defendants entered into a memorandum of understanding (the "Memorandum of Understanding") to settle the claims and allegations made in the lawsuit. As part of the consideration for the settlement, the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") was amended to provide for contractual appraisal rights for the unitholders. In January 2014, the defendants and representatives of the plaintiffs entered into a stipulation of settlement (the "Stipulation of Settlement"). The Stipulation of Settlement provides for a full and complete discharge, dismissal with prejudice, settlement and release of all claims, suits and causes of action by the plaintiffs (other than appraisal rights under the Merger Agreement) against the defendants and their representatives arising out of or relating to the allegations made in the Pioneer Southwest Lawsuit, the Pioneer Southwest merger or any deliberations, negotiations, disclosures, omissions, press releases, 21 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMarch 31, 2014(Unaudited)statements or misstatements in connection therewith, any fiduciary or other obligations in respect of the merger or any alternative transaction or under Pioneer Southwest's partnership agreement, or any costs and expenses associated with settlement other than as provided in the Stipulation of Settlement.On March 17, 2014, the Court entered an order approving the settlement of the Pioneer Southwest Lawsuit in accordance with the terms of the Stipulation of Settlement and dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice in its entirety as to the defendants and against plaintiffs and all other members of the Class.NOTE K.

The Company's effective tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to state income tax apportionments, nondeductible expenses and, for the three months ended March 31, 2014, the recognition of a $21 million tax benefit resulting from the resolution during the first quarter of 2014 of the tax uncertainty related to net operating loss carryovers and alternative minimum tax credits obtained from the 2012 acquisition of Premier Silica. There were no remaining unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2014.The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service has closed examinations of the 2011 and prior tax years and, with few exceptions, the Company believes that it is no longer subject to examinations by state and foreign tax authorities for years before 2008.

Subsequent EventsAs discussed in Note C, in April 2014 the Company completed the sale of Pioneer Alaska to an unaffiliated third party pursuant to an amended purchase and sale agreement for $300 million plus normal closing and other adjustments. 24 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFinancial and Operating PerformanceThe Company's financial and operating performance for the first quarter of 2014 included the following highlights:•Net income attributable to common stockholders for the first quarter of 2014 was $123 million ($0.85 per diluted share), as compared to net income of $101 million ($0.75 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2013. The increase in net income attributable to common stockholders is comprised of a $64 million increase in net income from continuing operations offset by a $42 million decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax. The primary components of the increase in net income from continuing operations include:•a $181 million increase in oil and gas revenues as a result of an eight percent increase in total sales volumes and a 15 percent increase in the average commodity prices received per BOE; partially offset by•a $62 million increase in net derivative losses, primarily as a result of increases in forward commodity prices and changes in the Company's portfolio of derivatives; •a $20 million increase in total oil and gas production costs and production and ad valorem taxes, primarily associated with the eight percent increase in sales volumes; and•a $19 million increase in general and administrative expense, primarily due to increased personnel, occupancy, information technology and legal costs resulting from the growth in employee headcount in support of the Company's capital expansion initiatives.The primary components of the decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, include:•a $111 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of Pioneer Alaska and the Company's Barnett Shale field assets to their estimated fair value less costs to sell; partially offset by•a $19 million decrease in depletion, depreciation and amortization due to the assets of Pioneer Alaska and the Barnett Shale field being classified as held for sale at December 31, 2013; and•an $18 million increase in revenues and other income due to increased production and higher Alaskan PPT credits on qualifying capital expenditures.•During the first quarter of 2014, average daily sales volumes from continuing operations increased by eight percent to 171,944 BOEPD, as compared to 158,683 BOEPD during the first quarter of 2013. The increase in first quarter 2014 average daily sales volumes, as compared to the first quarter of 2013, is primarily due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford Shale horizontal drilling programs.•Average oil, NGL and gas prices increased during the first quarter of 2014 to $92.38 per BBL, $33.38 per BBL and $4.81 per MCF, respectively, as compared to $87.67 per BBL, $30.86 per BBL and $3.17 per MCF, respectively, in the first quarter of 2013. •Average oil and gas production costs per BOE increased to $10.65 for the first quarter of 2014, as compared to $10.47 for the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in lease operating expenses as a result of increased fuel and labor costs, offset by lower net natural gas plant charges due to increased gathering and processing revenues from processing third-party gas in Company-owned facilities.•Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $466 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $360 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. The $106 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to an increase in sales volumes and commodity prices, partially offset by a decrease in realized derivative gains.•As of March 31, 2014, the Company's net debt to book capitalization increased to 27 percent, as compared to 25 percent as of December 31, 2013, principally reflective of a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $136 million, an increase in long-term debt of $53 million and net income of $123 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014. Recent DevelopmentsDuring the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell 100 percent of the capital stock in Pioneer Alaska. In April 2014, the Company completed the sale of Pioneer Alaska to an unaffiliated third party pursuant to an amended purchase and sale agreement for $300 million before normal closing and other adjustments. 25 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY Second Quarter 2014 OutlookBased on current estimates, the Company expects the following operating and financial results from continuing operations for the quarter ending June 30, 2014:Production is forecasted to average 173,000 to 178,000 BOEPD. Production costs (including production and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs) are expected to average $13.50 to $15.50 per BOE based on current NYMEX strip commodity prices. DD&A expense is expected to average $13.50 to $15.50 per BOE.Total exploration and abandonment expense is expected to be $25 million to $35 million. General and administrative expense is expected to be $80 million to $85 million. Interest expense is expected to be $47 million to $52 million, and other expense is expected to be $25 million to $35 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is expected to be $3 million to $5 million.The Company's effective income tax rate is expected to range from 35 percent to 40 percent assuming current capital spending plans and no significant mark-to-market changes in the Company's derivative position. Cash income taxes are expected to range from $10 million to $15 million and are primarily attributable to federal alternative minimum tax and state taxes.Operations and Drilling HighlightsThe following table summarizes the Company's average daily oil, NGL, gas and total production by asset area during the three months ended March 31, 2014:  Oil (BBLs) NGLs (BBLs) Gas (MCF) Total (BOE)Permian Basin 58,356 17,100 70,314 87,175South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale 16,787 12,017 82,849 42,611Raton Basin — — 126,451 21,075Mid-Continent 3,066 6,636 38,268 16,080South Texas - Other 380 7 27,597 4,987Other — 3 70 16 Total continuing operations 78,589 35,763 345,549 171,944Barnett Shale 2,163 3,157 24,909 9,472Alaska 4,058 — — 4,058 Total including discontinued operations 84,810 38,920 370,458 185,474During 2014 and 2013, the Company has focused its capital budgets and expenditures on oil and liquids-rich gas drilling activities due to relatively lower gas prices. As a result of these capital activities, the Company's total liquids production from continuing operations increased to 67 percent of total production, on a BOE basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to 62 percent for the same period last year. The Company's liquids revenue as a percent of total commodity sales decreased to 84 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to 86 percent for the same period last year, due to a 52 percent increase in the average gas price relative to increases of five percent and eight percent in the average oil and NGL prices, respectively.26 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY The following table summarizes by geographic area the Company's finding and development costs incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2014:   Acquisition Costs Exploration Development AssetRetirement    Proved Unproved Costs Costs Obligations Total  (in millions)Permian Basin $— $3 $181 $272 $(1) $455South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale — — 93 64 — 157Raton Basin — — 1 4 — 5Mid-Continent — — 1 1 — 2South Texas - Other — — 5 3 — 8Other — 1 3 — — 4 Total continuing operations — 4 284 344 (1) 631Barnett Shale 2 1 48 11 — 62Alaska — — (1) 48 4 51 Total including discontinued operations $2 $5 $331 $403 $3 $744The following table summarizes the Company's development and exploration/extension drilling activities for the three months ended March 31, 2014:   Development Drilling  Beginning Wellsin Progress WellsSpud SuccessfulWells WellsSold Ending Wellsin ProgressPermian Basin 59 72 77 4 50South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale 16 8 13 — 11 Total continuing operations 75 80 90 4 61Barnett Shale 1 — 1 — —Alaska 4 1 — — 5 Total including discontinued operations 80 81 91 4 66   Exploration/Extension Drilling  Beginning Wellsin Progress WellsSpud SuccessfulWells WellsSold Ending Wellsin ProgressPermian Basin 31 48 22 1 56South Texas - Eagle Ford Shale 24 25 19 — 30South Texas - Other — 2 1 — 1Other 3 — — — 3 Total continuing operations 58 75 42 1 90Barnett Shale 17 18 15 — 20Alaska 2 — — — 2Total including discontinued operations 77 93 57 1 112Permian Basin area. The Company successfully completed 99 wells in the Permian Basin area during the first three months of 2014. During 2014, the Company expects to drill approximately 200 vertical wells and 255 horizontal wells, with the horizontal wells being drilled in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp Shale horizons. The Company expects to spend $2.4 billion of drilling capital in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area during 2014.The Company believes it has significant resource potential within its acreage based on its extensive geologic data covering the Spraberry and Wolfcamp A, B, C and D intervals and its drilling results to-date. During 2014, the Company expects to drill 140 horizontal wells in the northern portion of the play and 115 horizontal wells in the southern portion of the play, where the Company has its joint venture with Sinochem. The wells in these areas are expected to be drilled on three-well pads to gain efficiencies; therefore, the wells will not be completed until after the last well on each pad is drilled and, accordingly, production from these wells is not expected until all wells on the pad are ready to produce. With the addition of drilling rigs during the first 27 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYquarter of 2014, combined with the effects of pad drilling, the Company continues to expect production growth to be weighted towards the second half of 2014. The Company continues to drill vertically to deeper intervals in the Spraberry field below the Wolfcamp interval, including the Strawn and Atoka intervals. The Company expects to drill approximately 200 vertical wells predominately targeting deeper intervals during 2014. These wells are being drilled to meet continuous drilling obligations.The Company continues to benefit from its integrated services to control drilling and operating costs and support the execution of its drilling and production activities in the Spraberry field. The Company is currently utilizing seven Company-owned fracture stimulation fleets totaling approximately 200,000 horsepower in the Spraberry field. To support its operations, the Company also owns other field service equipment, including pulling units, fracture stimulation tanks, water transport trucks, hot oilers, blowout preventers, construction equipment and fishing tools. In addition, Premier Silica (the Company's wholly-owned sand mining subsidiary) is supplying brown sand for proppant, which is being used by the Company to fracture stimulate vertical and horizontal wells in the Spraberry and Wolfcamp Shale intervals.During April 2014, the Company extended its gas processing agreement with Atlas Pipeline Partners, L.P. ("Atlas") for an additional 10 years (through 2032) to help ensure adequate gas processing capacity across the Spraberry/Wolfcamp area as the Company increases its drilling activities. Associated with the agreement, Atlas is adding 400 million cubic feet per day of new processing capacity by the second half of 2015, with half of the new capacity coming online during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the other half coming online during the second half of 2015. The Company owns a 27 percent interest in the Atlas gas processing facilities and will fund its share of capital to build these new facilities.Eagle Ford Shale area. The Company's drilling activities in the South Texas area during 2014 continue to be primarily focused on delineation and development of Pioneer's substantial acreage position in the Eagle Ford Shale play. The 2014 drilling program has been focused on liquids-rich drilling, with no wells currently planned to be drilled in dry gas acreage.The Company completed 32 horizontal Eagle Ford Shale wells during the first three months of 2014, all of which were successful, with average lateral lengths of approximately 5,500 feet and, on average, 19-stage fracture stimulations. Of the 32 Eagle Ford Shale wells that were placed on production during the first three months of 2014, the Company placed six Upper Eagle Ford Shale wells on production and estimates that approximately 25 percent of the Company's acreage is prospective for this interval in the Eagle Ford Shale play. The Company plans to spend $545 million of drilling capital in 2014 to drill approximately 110 Eagle Ford Shale wells. The Company is operating two Pioneer-owned fracture stimulation fleets during 2014 in the Eagle Ford Shale play.The Company's drilling operations in the Eagle Ford Shale continue to focus on improving drilling efficiencies. In 2013, the Company added approximately 300 drilling locations in the liquids-rich area of the play as a result of downspacing from 1,000 feet between wells (120-acre spacing) to 500 feet (60-acre spacing) between wells. Further downspacing and staggered testing to 175 feet between wells is underway in the liquids-rich areas where the 500-foot spacing was successful. Some areas will include testing of the Lower Eagle Ford Shale interval only, while others will include a combination of the Lower and Upper Eagle Ford Shale intervals. Early results from the initial 300-foot downspacing and staggered test in the Lower Eagle Ford Shale continue to be encouraging with six downspaced wells performing consistently with offset 500-foot spaced wells. In 2014, most Eagle Ford Shale wells will be drilled utilizing three-well and four-well pads. Pad sizes generally range from two to five wells, which are not completed until all of the wells on the pad are drilled. The time it takes to complete the pad is dependent upon how many wells are drilled on each pad. Pad drilling saves the Company a significant amount of capital costs per well, as compared to drilling single-well locations.Over the past two years, the Company has been testing the use of lower-cost white sand instead of ceramic proppant to fracture stimulate wells drilled in shallower areas of the field. The Company is expanding the use of white sand proppant to deeper areas of the field to further define its performance limits. Early well performance has been similar to direct offset ceramic-stimulated wells. The Company is continuing to monitor the performance of these wells and expects that the majority of its 2014 drilling program in the Eagle Ford Shale area will use lower-cost white sand proppant. Barnett Shale. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to divest of its net assets in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. The plan is expected to result in the sale of the Barnett Shale net assets during 2014. The Company classified the Barnett Shale field assets and liabilities as held for sale in the Company's accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Results of operations from the Company's Barnett Shale field are reported as discontinued operations, net of tax in the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations.See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information about the Company's plan to sell its Barnett Shale assets.28 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe Company continues to pursue the sale of the Barnett Shale net assets. No assurance can be given that the sale will be completed in accordance with the Company's plans.Alaska. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell 100 percent of the capital stock in Pioneer Alaska. In April 2014, the Company completed the sale of Pioneer Alaska to an unaffiliated third party pursuant to an amended purchase and sale agreement. The assets and liabilities of Pioneer Alaska are classified as held for sale in the Company's accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Pioneer Alaska's results of operations are reported as discontinued operations, net of tax in the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations.See Notes C and F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information about the Company's divestiture and exploration projects in Alaska, respectively.Results of Operations from Continuing OperationsOil and gas revenues. Oil and gas revenues totaled $910 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $729 million for the same period in 2013. The increase in oil and gas revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, reflected 14 percent and 19 percent increases in daily oil and NGL sales volumes, respectively, and five percent, eight percent and 52 percent increases in average oil, NGL and gas prices, respectively. Partially offsetting the effects of these increases was a four percent decline in gas sales volumes. The following table provides average daily sales volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:   Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2014 2013Oil (BBLs) 78,589 68,786NGLs (BBLs) 35,763 29,951Gas (MCF) 345,549 359,677Total (BOEs) 171,944 158,683Average daily BOE sales volumes increased by eight percent for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, principally due to the Company's successful Spraberry/Wolfcamp and Eagle Ford Shale drilling programs. The oil, NGL and gas prices that the Company reports are based on the market prices received for each commodity. The following table provides the Company's average prices for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:   Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2014 2013Oil (per BBL) $92.38 $87.67NGL (per BBL) $33.38 $30.86Gas (per MCF) $4.81 $3.17Total (per BOE) $58.83 $51.01Sales of purchased oil and gas. The Company periodically enters into pipeline capacity commitments in order to secure available oil, NGL and gas transportation capacity from the Company’s areas of production. The Company enters into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties to satisfy unused pipeline capacity commitments and to diversify a portion of the Company's WTI oil sales to a Gulf Coast oil price. Revenues and expenses from these transactions are presented on a gross basis as the Company acts as a principal in the transaction by assuming the risk and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, of the commodities purchased and assuming responsibility to deliver the commodities sold. Deficiency payments on excess pipeline capacity commitments are included in other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for further information on transportation commitment charges. Interest and other income.  Interest and other income for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was $4 million, as compared to a nominal amount for the same period in 2013. The increase in interest and other income for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, is primarily due to a decrease of $5 million in the net loss from vertical integration 29 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYservices between the quarters. See Note K of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information.Derivative losses, net. The Company utilizes commodity swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short puts to (i) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces, sells and consumes, (ii) support the Company's annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and (iii) reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Company recorded $104 million of net derivative losses on commodity price and interest rate derivatives, of which $18 million represented net cash payments. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, the Company recorded $42 million of net derivative losses, which was net of $54 million of cash receipts. Derivative gains and losses result from changes in the fair values of the Company's derivative contracts. See Notes D and E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information regarding the Company's derivative activities and market risks associated with those activities. Gain on disposition of assets, net. The Company recorded net gains on the disposition of assets of $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $24 million for the same period in 2013. The net gain for the three months ended March 31, 2014 included the Company's February 2014 sale of proved and unproved properties in Gaines and Dawson counties in the Spraberry field in West Texas for net cash proceeds of $68 million, which resulted in a gain of $3 million. The Company also recognized a $1 million gain during the first quarter of 2014 associated with the sale of Sendero.The net gain for the three months ended March 31, 2013 is primarily associated with the sale of the Company's interest in unproved oil and gas properties adjacent to the Company's West Panhandle field operations for net cash proceeds of $38 million, which resulted in a gain of $22 million. See Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the Company's gains and losses on the disposition of assets.Oil and gas production costs. The Company recorded oil and gas production costs of $165 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $150 million during the same period in 2013. Lease operating expenses and workover costs represent the components of oil and gas production costs over which the Company has management control, while third-party transportation charges represent the cost to transport volumes produced to a sales point. Net natural gas plant charges represent the net costs to gather and process the Company's gas, reduced by net revenues earned from the gathering and processing of third-party gas in Company-owned facilities.Total oil and gas production costs per BOE for the three months ended March 31, 2014 increased by two percent as compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in production costs per BOE during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, is primarily reflective of (i) a $0.60 increase in lease operating expenses during the first quarter of 2014 to repair the damage caused by severe winter weather during the fourth quarter of 2013 in the Spraberry field, (ii) a $0.28 per BOE decrease in net natural gas plant charges resulting from increased gathering and processing revenues from processing third-party gas in Company-owned facilities and (iii) a $0.14 per BOE decrease in workover expenses, primarily related to reduced activity levels.  The following table provides the components of the Company's oil and gas production costs per BOE for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:   Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2014 2013Lease operating expenses $8.29 $7.69Third-party transportation charges 1.66 1.66Net natural gas plant charges (0.03) 0.25Workover costs 0.73 0.87Total production costs $10.65 $10.47Production and ad valorem taxes. The Company's production and ad valorem taxes were $57 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $52 million for the same period in 2013. In general, production and ad valorem taxes are directly related to commodity price changes; however, Texas ad valorem taxes are based upon prior year commodity prices, whereas production taxes are based upon current year commodity prices. 30 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe following table provides the Company's production and ad valorem taxes per BOE for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013:   Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2014 2013Production taxes $2.31 $2.22Ad valorem taxes 1.37 1.39Total production and ad valorem taxes $3.68$3.61Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense. The Company's DD&A expense was $221 million ($14.27 per BOE) for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $212 million ($14.82 per BOE) during the same period in 2013. The decrease in per BOE DD&A expense during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, is primarily due to the change in depletion expense.Depletion expense on oil and gas properties was $13.70 per BOE during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $14.15 per BOE during the same period in 2013. The three percent decrease in per BOE depletion expense during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, is primarily due to the impairment of proved properties in the Raton field during the fourth quarter of 2013, which reduced the Raton field's carrying value by $1.5 billion.Impairment of oil and gas properties. The Company performs assessments of its long-lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows attributable to its properties may change in the future resulting in the need to impair their carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future cash flows are (i) future reserve adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (ii) results of future drilling activities, (iii) Management's Price Outlooks and (iv) increases or decreases in production and capital costs associated with these fields.Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the Company's geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes expense and lease abandonments and other exploration expense for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):   Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2014 2013Geological and geophysical $24 $18Exploratory dry holes 1 —Leasehold abandonments and other 6 —  $31 $18The Company's geological and geophysical costs increased by $6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, primarily due to increased seismic and seismic interpretation expenditures supportive of drilling activities in the Spraberry field. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Company drilled and evaluated 57 exploration/extension wells, all of which were successfully completed as discoveries. During the same period in 2013, the Company drilled and evaluated 49 exploration/extension wells, 47 of which were successfully completed as discoveries.General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was $81 million, as compared to $62 million for the same period in 2013. The total number of employees of the Company increased from approximately 3,950 in March 2013 to approximately 4,350 in March 2014. The increase in general and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, is primarily due to increases in expenses related to personnel, occupancy, information technology, and legal costs in support of the Company's capital expansion initiatives. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations was $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for information regarding the Company's asset retirement obligations. 31 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYInterest expense. Interest expense was $45 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $51 million during the same period in 2013. The weighted average interest rate on the Company's indebtedness for the three months ended March 31, 2014, including the effects of capitalized interest, was 6.3 percent as compared to 5.9 percent for the same period in 2013. The $6 million decrease in interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013, is primarily due to a decrease in debt as a result of applying net cash proceeds from the Company's (i) $1.3 billion equity offering during the first quarter of 2013 and (ii) $624 million upfront cash receipts associated with the sale of a 40 percent interest in 207,000 net acres in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play in the southern portion of the Spraberry field to Sinochem during the second quarter of 2013.Other expense. Other expense was $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $20 million during the same period in 2013. The decrease in other expense for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, is primarily due to a $4 million decrease in above market and idle drilling and well service equipment charges. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information.Income tax provision. The Company recorded income tax provisions from continuing operations of $53 million and $50 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 was 26 percent and 37 percent, respectively, as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35 percent. The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate during the first quarter of 2014 is primarily due to the recognition of a $21 million tax benefit related to net operating loss carryovers and alternative minimum tax credits obtained from the 2012 acquisition of Premier Silica. See Note M of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.Income/loss from discontinued operations, net of tax. The Company reported a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $16 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease in earnings from discontinued operations is primarily the result of the $111 million impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of Pioneer Alaska and the Company's Barnett Shale field assets to their estimated fair value less costs to sell. This decrease was partially offset by (i) an increase in revenues and other income of $18 million due to increased production and higher PPT credits on qualifying capital expenditures and (ii) a decrease in depletion, depreciation and amortization costs of $19 million due to the assets of Pioneer Alaska and the Barnett Shale field being classified as held for sale beginning at December 31, 2013. See Note C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for specific information regarding the Company's discontinued operations.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was nominal, as compared to $8 million for the same period in 2013. The $8 million decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, is due to the Pioneer Southwest merger in December 2013. The portion of income from noncontrolling interest for the three months ended March 31, 2013 related to Pioneer Southwest was $8 million. Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and LiquidityCapital commitments. The Company's primary needs for cash are for capital expenditures and acquisition expenditures on oil and gas properties and related vertical integration assets and facilities, payment of contractual obligations, dividends and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, cash and cash equivalents on hand, proceeds from the divestiture of assets held for sale, proceeds from the sales of other nonstrategic assets or external financing sources as discussed in "Capital resources" below.The Company's capital budget for 2014 is focused on liquids-rich gas drilling activities with total planned expenditures of $3.3 billion (excluding acquisitions, asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical administrative costs and capital expenditures associated with Pioneer Alaska and Barnett Shale field assets prior to their sale), consisting of $3.0 billion for drilling operations, including budgeted land capital for existing assets, and $285 million for buildings, vertical integration and other plant and equipment additions. Based on results for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and Management's Price Outlook, the Company expects its cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, proceeds from the divestiture of assets held for sale, proceeds from other nonstrategic assets sales and, if necessary, availability under its Credit Facility to be sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the remainder of 2014.Investing activities. Investing activities used $626 million of cash during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to $707 million of cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2013. The $81 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the three months ending March 31, 2014, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013, is primarily due to (i) a $40 million increase in proceeds from the disposition of assets, (ii) a $33 million decrease in additions to oil and gas properties, partially due to the drilling carry being paid by Sinochem in the southern portion of the 32 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYhorizontal Wolfcamp Shale play during the first quarter of 2014 and (iii) an $8 million decrease in additions to other assets and other property and equipment. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Company's expenditures for investing activities were funded by net cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility.Dividends/distributions. During February of both 2014 and 2013, the Board declared semiannual dividends of $0.04 per common share. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, and, if declared, the Board may change the current dividend amount based on the Company's liquidity and capital resources at the time.During January 2013, the Pioneer Southwest board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.52 per limited partner unit. Associated therewith, Pioneer Southwest paid aggregate distributions to noncontrolling unitholders of $9 million during the three months ended March 31, 2013. Contractual obligations, including off-balance sheet obligations. The Company's contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling commitments (including commitments to pay day rates for drilling rigs), capital funding obligations, derivative obligations, firm transportation and fractionation commitments, minimum annual gathering, treating and transportation commitments and other liabilities (including postretirement benefit obligations). From time-to-time, the Company enters into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of March 31, 2014, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that the Company has entered into include (i) operating lease agreements, (ii) drilling commitments, (iii) firm transportation and fractionation commitments, (iv) open purchase commitments and (v) contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable, such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices or interest rates and gathering, treating, fractionation and transportation commitments on uncertain volumes of future throughput, open delivery commitments and indemnification obligations following certain divestitures. Other than the off-balance sheet arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other parties that are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. Since December 31, 2013, the material changes in the Company's contractual obligations include a $50 million increase in borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility and an $86 million decrease in the Company's derivative net assets. The Company's commodity and interest rate derivative contracts are periodically measured and recorded at fair value and continue to be subject to market or credit risk. As of March 31, 2014, these contracts represented net assets of $59 million. The ultimate liquidation value of the Company's commodity and interest rate derivatives will be dependent upon actual future commodity prices and interest rates, which may differ materially from the inputs used to determine the derivatives' fair values as of March 31, 2014. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" and "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information about the Company's derivative instruments and market risk.Capital resources. The Company's primary capital resources are cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from the divestiture of assets held for sale, proceeds from sales of other nonstrategic assets and proceeds from financing activities (principally borrowings under the Company's Credit Facility or issuances of debt or equity securities). If internal cash flows and cash on hand do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may reduce its level of capital expenditures, and/or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using availability under its Credit Facility, issue debt or equity securities or obtain capital from other sources, such as through the sale of nonstrategic assets.Operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2014 was $466 million, as compared to $360 million during the same period in 2013. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013, is primarily due to an increase in oil, NGL and gas sales volumes as a result of the Company's successful drilling program and higher realized commodity prices, partially offset by a decrease in realized derivative gains.Asset divestitures.  During the first quarter of 2014, the Company completed the sale of (i) Sendero for cash proceeds of $31 million (Sendero had $14 million of cash on hand at the time of the sale) and (ii) proved and unproved properties in Gaines and Dawson counties in the Spraberry field in West Texas for net cash proceeds of $68 million. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company committed to a plan to sell 100 percent of the capital stock in Pioneer Alaska. In April 2014, the Company completed the sale of Pioneer Alaska to an unaffiliated third party pursuant to an amended purchase and sale agreement. Associated with the sale of Pioneer Alaska, the Company recorded an additional noncash impairment loss of $97 million during the three months ended March 31, 2014. The Company has classified Pioneer Alaska assets and liabilities as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 and has reported Pioneer Alaska's historical results of operations, and the related impairment loss, as discontinued operations, net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.33 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company also committed to a plan to divest of its net assets in the Barnett Shale field in North Texas. The plan is expected to result in the sale of the Barnett Shale net assets during 2014. The Company has classified Barnett Shale assets and liabilities as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 and has reported Barnett Shale historical results of operations, and the related impairment loss, as discontinued operations, net of tax in the Company's accompanying consolidated statements of operations.In January 2013, the Company signed an agreement with Sinochem, an unaffiliated third party, to sell 40 percent of Pioneer's interest in 207,000 net acres leased by the Company in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play in the southern portion of the Spraberry field for total consideration of $1.8 billion, including normal closing adjustments. In May 2013, the Company completed the sale to Sinochem for net cash proceeds of $624 million. Sinochem is paying the remaining $1.2 billion of the transaction price by carrying 75 percent of Pioneer's portion of ongoing drilling and facilities costs attributable to the Company's joint operations with Sinochem in the horizontal Wolfcamp Shale play. Financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2014 was $24 million, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $548 million during the three months ended 2013. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2014, as compared to the same period of 2013, is primarily the result of a decrease of $1.3 billion of realized net proceeds from the Company's completion of an offering of its common stock in February 2013, partially offset by (i) a decrease in net principal payments on long-term debt of $757 million and (ii) a decrease of $9 million in distributions to noncontrolling interests.As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred stock or common stock. The Company cannot predict the timing or ultimate outcome of any such actions as they are subject to market conditions, among other factors. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined by the Board. Liquidity. The Company's principal sources of short-term liquidity are cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2014, the Company had $50 million of outstanding borrowings under its Credit Facility, leaving $1.4 billion of unused borrowing capacity. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of March 31, 2014. The Company also had cash on hand of $257 million as of March 31, 2014. If internal cash flows and cash on hand do not meet the Company's expectations, the Company may reduce its level of capital expenditures, reduce dividend payments, and/or fund a portion of its capital expenditures using borrowings under its Credit Facility, issuances of debt or equity securities or other sources, such as the sale of nonstrategic assets. The Company cannot provide any assurance that needed short-term or long-term liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Although the Company expects that internal operating cash flows, cash on hand, proceeds from the divestiture of assets held for sale, proceeds from the sales of other nonstrategic assets and, if necessary, available capacity under the Company's Credit Facility will be adequate to fund 2014 capital expenditures and dividend payments and provide adequate liquidity to fund other needs, no assurances can be given that such funding sources will be adequate to meet the Company's future needs.Debt ratings. The Company is rated as investment grade by three credit rating agencies. The Company receives debt credit ratings from several of the major ratings agencies, which are subject to regular reviews. The Company believes that each of the rating agencies considers many factors in determining the Company's ratings including: production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels, asset composition and proved reserve mix. A reduction in the Company's debt ratings could increase the interest rates that the Company incurs on Credit Facility borrowings and could negatively impact the Company's ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. Book capitalization and current ratio. The Company's net book capitalization at March 31, 2014 was $9.2 billion, consisting of $257 million of cash and cash equivalents, debt of $2.7 billion and equity of $6.7 billion. The Company's net debt to net book capitalization was 27 percent and 25 percent at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The Company's ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to 1.25 to 1.00 at March 31, 2014, as compared to 1.38 to 1.00 at December 31, 2013, primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. New accounting pronouncements. The effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item1. Financial Statements".34 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe following quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are supplementary to the quantitative and qualitative disclosures provided in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. As such, the information contained herein should be read in conjunction with the related disclosures in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Company's potential exposure to market risks. The term "market risks," insofar as it relates to currently anticipated transactions of the Company, refers to the risk of loss arising from changes in commodity prices and interest rates. These disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators regarding how the Company views and manages ongoing market risk exposures. None of the Company's market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for speculative purposes.The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of the Company's open derivative contracts during the three months ending March 31, 2014:  Derivative Contract Net Assets  Commodities Interest Rates Total  (in millions)Fair value of contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2013 $145 $— $145Changes in contract fair value (114) 10 (104)Contract maturity payments (receipts) 22 (4) 18Fair value of contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2014 $53 $6 $59Interest rate sensitivity.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information regarding the Company's long-term debt.35 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYThe following table provides information about financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of March 31, 2014 and that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents debt maturities by expected maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt given current contractual terms and market conditions and the debt's estimated fair value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically pay on the debt as of March 31, 2014. For variable rate debt, the average interest rate represents the average rates being paid on the debt projected forward proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on May 5, 2014.

The following table provides information about the Company's oil, NGL and gas derivative financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil, NGL and gas prices as of March 31, 2014. Although mitigated by the Company's derivative activities, declines in oil, NGL and gas prices would reduce the Company's revenues.The Company manages commodity price risk with derivative contracts, such as swap contracts, collar contracts and collar contracts with short put options. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes. Collar contracts provide minimum ("floor" or "long put") and maximum ("ceiling") prices on a notional amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price. Collar contracts with short put options differ from other collar contracts by virtue of the short put option price, below which the Company's realized price will exceed the variable market prices by the long put-to-short put price differential.See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements" for a description of the accounting procedures followed by the Company relative to its derivative financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of the Company's derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil, NGL or gas prices.36 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY  Nine Months Ending December 31, Year Ending December 31, Asset (Liability) Fair Value at March 31,  2014 2015 2016 2014 (a)        (in millions)Oil Derivatives:        Average daily notional BBL volumes:        Collar contracts with short puts (b) 69,000 86,500 25,000 $76Weighted average ceiling price per BBL $114.05 $99.01 $93.30  Weighted average floor price per BBL $93.70 $88.09 $85.00  Weighted average short put price per BBL $77.61 $73.18 $70.00  Swap contracts 10,000 — — $(11)Weighted average fixed price per BBL $93.87 $— $—  Average forward NYMEX oil prices (c) $96.95 $90.30 $85.24  Rollfactor swap contracts (d) 9,455 5,000 — $(1)Weighted average fixed price per BBL $1.08 $0.60 $—  Average forward rollfactor prices (c) $1.11 $0.72 $0.37  NGL Derivatives:        Average daily notional BBL volumes:        Collar contracts with short puts (e) 1,000 — — $1Weighted average ceiling price per BBL $109.50 $— $—  Weighted average floor price per BBL $95.00 $— $—  Weighted average short put price per BBL $80.00 $— $—  Average forward NGL prices (f) $87.45 $80.48 $73.18  Collar contracts (g) 3,000 — — $—Weighted average ceiling price per BBL $13.72 $— $—  Weighted average floor price per BBL $10.78 $— $—  Average forward NGL prices (f) $12.37 $11.98 $11.46  Swap contracts (h) 2,556 — — $2Weighted average fixed price per BBL $48.15 $— $—  Average forward NGL prices (f) $45.00 $43.47 $41.77  Gas Derivatives:        Average daily notional MMBTU volumes:        Collar contracts with short puts 115,000 285,000 20,000 $8Weighted average ceiling price per MMBTU $4.70 $5.07 $5.36  Weighted average floor price per MMBTU $4.00 $4.00 $4.00  Weighted average short put price per MMBTU $3.00 $3.00 $3.00  Swap contracts 195,000 20,000 — $(22)Weighted average fixed price per MMBTU $4.04 $4.31 $—  Average forward NYMEX gas prices (c) $4.72 $4.40 $4.34  Basis swap contracts (i) 123,382 30,000 — $—Weighted average fixed price per MMBTU $(0.22) $(0.18) $—  Average forward basis differential prices (j) $(0.23) $(0.24) $—   ___________________(a)In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 210-20 and ASC 815-10, the Company classifies the fair value amounts of derivative assets and liabilities executed under master netting arrangements as net derivative assets or net derivative liabilities, as the case may be.

The Company's management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 39 Table of ContentsPIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANYPART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings  The Company is party to the legal proceedings that are described in Note J of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 1. Financial Statements." The Company is also party to other proceedings and claims incidental to its business.
