Item 1A.   Risk Factors       In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, under the headings "Item 1. Business – Competition, Markets and Regulations," "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," which risks could materially affect the Company's business, financial condition or future results. Except as stated below, there has been no material change in the Company's risk factors from those described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.   A subsidiary of the Company acts as the general partner of a publicly-traded limited partnership. As such, the subsidiary's operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations.   A subsidiary of the Company acts as the general partner of Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P., a publicly-traded limited partnership formed by the Company to own and acquire oil and gas assets in its area of operations. As general partner, the subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations to the partnership. Activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to others typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability, particularly when a conflict of interest is found to exist. Any such liability may be material.   The Company is subject to regulations that may cause it to incur substantial costs.   As previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations," the Company's business is regulated by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, our properties located in Colorado are subject to the authority of the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (the "COGCC"). The COGCC has published proposed rules that could increase the Company's costs of permitting and environmental compliance. The COGCC initiated formal rule-making in the first quarter of 2008, and final rules could be effective during the second quarter of 2009. While this regulatory development has not adversely affected the Company's operations to date, these additional rules could cause additional costs, delay and uncertainty in the Company's operations in Colorado and may be emulated in other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. There can be no assurance that present or future regulations will not adversely affect the Company's business and operations. See "Item 1. Business — Competition, Markets and Regulations" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding government regulation.   Our expectations for future drilling activities will be realized over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing.   The Company has identified drilling locations and prospects for infill drilling and enhanced recovery activities. These drilling locations and prospects represent a significant part of the Company's future drilling plans. The Company's ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, negotiation of agreements with third parties, commodity prices, costs and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, the Company can not give any assurance as to the timing of these activities or that they will ultimately result in the realization of proved reserves or meet the Company's expectations for success. As such, the Company's actual drilling and secondary activities may materially differ from the Company's current expectations, which could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.    61         PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY       The failure by counterparties to the Company's hedging activities to perform their obligations could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.   To achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce the Company's exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil, NGL and gas, the Company's strategy is to enter into derivative arrangements covering a portion of its oil, NGL and gas production. The use of hedging transactions involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions. The Company's derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to mitigate its exposure to any individual counterparty. If any of these counterparties were to default in its obligations under the Company's hedging arrangements, such a default could have a material, adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, and could result in a larger percentage of the Company's future production being subject to commodity price changes. In addition, in light of the current economic outlook, it is possible that fewer counterparties will participate in hedging transactions, which could result in a greater concentration of the Company's exposure to any one counterparty, or a larger percentage of the Company's future production could be subject to commodity price changes.   A failure by purchasers of the Company's production to perform their obligations to the Company could require the Company to recognize a pre-tax charge in earnings and have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operation.   Recently, there has been a significant decline in the credit markets and the availability of credit, and equity values have substantially declined. To the extent that purchasers of the Company's production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there could be an increased risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to the Company. If for any reason the Company were to determine that it was probable that some or all of the accounts receivable from any one or more of the purchasers of the Company's production were uncollectible, the Company would recognize a pre-tax charge in the earnings of that period for the probable loss.   The Company may not be able to obtain funding, obtain funding on acceptable terms or obtain funding under its current credit facility because of the deterioration of the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent the Company from meeting its future capital needs.   Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and continue to be, disrupted and volatile. The debt and equity capital markets have been exceedingly distressed. These issues, along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the repricing of credit risk and the current weak economic conditions have made, and will likely continue to make, it difficult to obtain funding. In addition, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards, refused to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to the Company's current debt and reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. In addition, the Company may be unable to obtain adequate funding under its current credit facility because (i) the Company's lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations or (ii) the amount the Company may borrow under its current credit facility could be reduced as a result of lower oil, NGL or gas prices, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, or for other reasons. Due to these factors, the Company cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, the Company may be unable to implement its business plans, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's production, revenues and results of operations.   Declining general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse affect on the Company's results of operations.   Recently, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of recession or slower global economic growth going forward.    62             PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY       These factors, combined with volatile oil prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a possible recession. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices, both of which have contributed to a decline in the Company's share price and corresponding market capitalization. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad continues to deteriorate, demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which the Company can sell its oil, NGLs and gas and ultimately decrease the Company's net revenue and profitability.   These risks are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that it currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or future results.
