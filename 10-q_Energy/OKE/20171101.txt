ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSOur investors should consider the risks set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report that could affect us and our business, except for the additional risk factor discussed below. Although we have tried to discuss key factors, our investors need to be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Investors should carefully consider the discussion of risks and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report, including “Forward-Looking Statements,” which are included in Part I, Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.69Table of Contents Our consolidated debt and guarantee obligations could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our ability to borrow additional funds and place us at a competitive disadvantage.In connection with the Merger Transaction, ONEOK Partners and the Intermediate Partnership entered into agreements guaranteeing our obligations under the 2017 Credit Agreement and our outstanding senior notes and commercial paper, and we entered into agreements guaranteeing ONEOK Partners’ obligations under the Term Loan Agreement and its outstanding senior notes. We are therefore liable for these debt obligations of ONEOK Partners in the event of a default. Our indebtedness, along with our guarantee obligations, could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our ability to borrow additional funds, place us at competitive disadvantages compared with our competitors that have less debt and fewer guarantee obligations and/or have other adverse consequences. For more information about our debt, see Note E of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report.ITEM 2.UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
