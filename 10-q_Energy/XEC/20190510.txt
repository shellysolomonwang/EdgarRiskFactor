At December 31, 2018, the unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to the 3.90% Notes due 2027 were $5.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. At March 31, 2019, the unamortized debt issuance costs and discount related to the 4.375% Notes due 2029 were $4.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The 4.375% Notes due 2024 were issued at par.41Table of ContentsBank DebtOn February 5, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement for our senior unsecured revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”). Among other things, the amended and restated credit facility increased the aggregate commitments to $1.25 billion with an option for us to increase the aggregate commitments to $1.5 billion, and extended the maturity date to February 5, 2024. As of March 31, 2019, we had no bank borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, leaving an unused borrowing availability of $1.25 billion.At our option, borrowings under the Credit Facility may bear interest at either (a) LIBOR plus 1.125 – 2.0% based on the credit rating for our senior unsecured long-term debt, or (b) a base rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus 0.125 – 1.0%, based on the credit rating for our senior unsecured long-term debt. Unused borrowings are subject to a commitment fee of 0.125 – 0.35%, based on the credit rating for our senior unsecured long-term debt.The Credit Facility contains representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default that are customary for investment grade, senior unsecured bank credit agreements, including a financial covenant for the maintenance of a defined total debt-to-capital ratio of no greater than 65%. As of March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants.At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had $4.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our Credit Facility, which were recorded as assets and included in Other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs are being amortized to interest expense ratably over the life of the Credit Facility. We incurred $3.0 million in additional debt issuance costs in amending our Credit Facility. Senior NotesOn March 8, 2019, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2029 at 99.862% of par to yield 4.392% per annum. We received $494.7 million in net cash proceeds, after deducting underwriters’ fees, discount, and debt issuance costs. The notes bear an annual interest rate of 4.375% and interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15, with the first payment occurring September 15, 2019. We used the net proceeds to repay borrowings under our Credit Facility. The effective interest rate on these notes, including the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, is 4.50%. In April 2017, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.90% senior unsecured notes at 99.748% of par to yield 3.93% per annum. These notes are due May 15, 2027 and interest is payable semiannually on May 15 and November 15. The effective interest rate on these notes, including the amortization of debt issuance costs and discount, is 4.01%.In June 2014, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior unsecured notes at par. These notes are due June 1, 2024 and interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1. The effective interest rate on these notes, including the amortization of debt issuance costs, is 4.50%. Our senior unsecured notes are governed by indentures containing certain covenants, events of default, and other restrictive provisions with which we were in compliance as of March 31, 2019. Working Capital AnalysisOur working capital fluctuates primarily as a result of our realized commodity prices, increases or decreases in our production volumes, changes in receivables and payables related to our operating and E&D activities, changes in our oil and gas well equipment and supplies, and changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.At March 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficit of $313.7 million, a decrease of $1.03 billion or 144% from a working capital surplus of $715.4 million at December 31, 2018.42Table of ContentsOur working capital decreased primarily due to the decrease in Cash and cash equivalents of $779.7 million, which was a result of our acquisition of Resolute and subsequent repayment of Resolute’s long-term debt. See Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the acquisition. In addition to the decrease in cash, other significant changes to working capital consisted primarily of the following decreases: •Our net current derivative instrument position decreased by $116.0 million from an asset at December 31, 2018 to a liability at March 31, 2019.•The adoption of Topic 842 increased our current liabilities by $68.8 million, representing lease liabilities, primarily for office space, well-head compressors, pipeline compressors, and artificial lift mechanisms. See Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our lease liabilities and the adoption of Topic 842.•Accrued liabilities related to our E&D expenditures increased by $59.3 million.Accounts receivable are a major component of our working capital and include amounts due from a diverse group of companies comprised of major energy companies, pipeline companies, local distribution companies, and other end-users. Historically, losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been significant. The fair value of derivative instruments fluctuates based on changes in the underlying price indices as compared to the contracted prices.DividendsA quarterly cash dividend has been paid on our common stock every quarter since the first quarter of 2006. In February 2019, our Board of Directors declared a $0.20 per common share dividend, totaling $20.3 million, which is payable on or before May 31, 2019 to stockholders of record on May 15, 2019. In March 2019, in conjunction with the Resolute acquisition, we issued 62.5 thousand shares of 8.125% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share. In March 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $20.31 per preferred share, totaling $1.3 million. The dividend was paid in April to preferred stockholders of record on April 1, 2019. Future dividend payments will depend on our level of earnings, financial requirements, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our stock and Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Resolute acquisition. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of March 31, 2019, our material off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of operating lease agreements with lease terms at commencement of 12 months or less. As an accounting policy we have elected not to apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to these leases. As such, we have not recorded any lease liabilities associated with these leases.43Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and Material CommitmentsAt March 31, 2019, we had the following contractual obligations and material commitments:  Payments Due by Period Contractual obligations (in thousands) Total 4/1/19 - 3/31/20 4/1/20 - 3/31/22 4/1/22 - 3/31/24 4/1/24 and Thereafter Long-term debt—principal (1) $2,000,000 $— $— $— $2,000,000 Long-term debt—interest (1) 648,344 82,307 167,875 167,875 230,287 Operating leases (2) 105,058 24,404 40,015 22,716 17,923 Unconditional purchase obligations (3) 58,274 22,874 23,898 6,901 4,601 Derivative liabilities 78,313 77,557 756 — — Asset retirement obligation (4) 179,257 13,728 —(4)—(4)—(4)Other long-term liabilities (5) 39,631 2,623 3,237 5,182 28,589   $3,108,877 $223,493 $235,781 $202,674 $2,281,400 ________________________________________(1)The interest payments presented above include the accrued interest payable on our long-term debt as of March 31, 2019 as well as future payments calculated using the long-term debt’s fixed rates, stated maturity dates, and principal amounts outstanding as of March 31, 2019. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.(2)Operating leases include the remaining contractual payments under lease agreements as of March 31, 2019. These lease agreements are primarily comprised of leases for commercial real estate, which consists primarily of office space, and compressor equipment.(3)Of the total unconditional purchase obligations, $32.1 million represents obligations for the purchase of sand for well completions and $25.6 million represents obligations for firm transportation agreements for gas pipeline capacity.(4)We have excluded the presentation of the timing of the cash flows associated with our long-term asset retirement obligations because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the future period of cash settlement. The long-term asset retirement obligation is included in the total asset retirement obligation presented.(5)Other long-term liabilities include contractual obligations associated with our employee supplemental savings plan, gas balancing liabilities, and other miscellaneous liabilities. All of these liabilities are accrued on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The current portion associated with these long-term liabilities is also presented in the table above.The following discusses various commercial commitments that we have made that may include potential future cash payments if we fail to meet various performance obligations. These are not reflected in the table above.At March 31, 2019, we had estimated commitments of approximately: (i) $447.9 million to finish drilling, completing, or performing other work on wells and various other infrastructure projects in progress and (ii) $36.3 million to finish gathering system construction in progress.At March 31, 2019, we had firm sales contracts to deliver approximately 456.4 Bcf of gas over the next 5.8 years. If we do not deliver this gas, our estimated financial commitment, calculated using the April 2019 index price, would be approximately $461.3 million. The value of this commitment will fluctuate due to price volatility and actual volumes delivered. However, we believe no financial commitment will be due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these volumetric obligations.44Table of ContentsIn connection with gas gathering and processing agreements, we have volume commitments over the next 9.8 years. If we do not deliver the committed gas or NGLs, as the case may be, the estimated maximum amount that would be payable under these commitments, calculated as of March 31, 2019, would be approximately $662.7 million. However, we believe no financial commitment will be due based on our current proved reserves and production levels from which we can fulfill these volumetric obligations.We have minimum volume delivery commitments associated with agreements to reimburse connection costs to various pipelines. If we do not deliver this gas, the estimated maximum amount that would be payable under these commitments, calculated as of March 31, 2019, would be approximately $55.5 million. Of this total, we have accrued a liability of $2.7 million representing the estimated amount we will have to pay due to insufficient forecasted volumes at particular connection points. All of the noted commitments were routine and made in the ordinary course of our business.Taking into account current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production, we believe that our net cash flow generated from operations and our other capital resources will be adequate to meet future obligations.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESWe consider accounting policies and estimates related to oil and gas reserves, full cost accounting, and income taxes to be critical accounting policies and estimates. These are summarized in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risk including the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates.Price FluctuationsOur major market risk is pricing applicable to our oil, gas, and NGL production. The prices we receive for our production are based on prevailing market conditions and are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control. Pricing for oil, gas, and NGL production has been volatile and unpredictable. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, our total production revenue was comprised of 62% oil sales, 19% gas sales, and 19% NGL sales. The following table shows how hypothetical changes in the realized prices we receive for our commodity sales may have impacted revenue for the periods indicated.    Impact on Revenue Change in Realized Price Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2019    (in thousands)Oil± $1.00per barrel ± $7,147Gas± $0.10per Mcf ± $5,752NGL± $1.00per barrel ± $6,566    ± $19,46545Table of ContentsWe periodically enter into financial derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our price risk associated with our future oil and gas production. At March 31, 2019, we had oil and gas derivatives covering a portion of our 2019 and 2020 production, which were recorded as current and non-current assets and liabilities. At March 31, 2019, our oil and gas derivatives had a gross asset fair value of $36.5 million and a gross liability fair value of $78.3 million. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our derivative instruments.While these contracts limit the downside risk of adverse price movements, they may also limit future cash flow from favorable price movements. The following table shows how hypothetical changes in the forward prices used to calculate the fair value of our derivatives may have impacted the fair value as of March 31, 2019.   Impact on Fair Value Change in Forward Price March 31, 2019   (in thousands)Oil-$1.00 $6,991Oil+$1.00 $(7,106)Gas-$0.10 $6,444Gas+$0.10 $(6,797)Interest Rate RiskAt March 31, 2019, our long-term debt consisted of $750 million of 4.375% senior unsecured notes that mature on June 1, 2024, $750 million of 3.90% senior unsecured notes that mature on May 15, 2027, and $500 million of 4.375% senior unsecured notes that mature on March 15, 2029. Because all of our outstanding long-term debt is at a fixed rate, we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal. See Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresCimarex’s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), have evaluated the effectiveness of Cimarex’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of March 31, 2019. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.46Table of ContentsPART II ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSThe information set forth under the heading “Litigation” in Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated by reference in response to this item. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future results.ITEM 6.
