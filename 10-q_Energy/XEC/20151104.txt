ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS        In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2014 as well as the updated risk factors set forth below. Other than with respect to the updated risk factors below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2014. The risks described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2014 and below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results.       Our hydraulic fracturing activities are subject to risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.       We use hydraulic fracturing for the completion of almost all of our wells. Hydraulic fracturing is a process that involves pumping fluid and proppant at high pressure into a hydrocarbon bearing formation to create and hold open fractures. Those fractures enable gas or oil to move through the formation's pores to the well bore. Typically, the fluid used in this process is primarily water. In plays where hydraulic fracturing is necessary for successful development, the demand for water may exceed the supply. A lack of readily available water or a significant increase in the cost of water could cause delays or increased completion costs.       While hydraulic fracturing historically has been regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation from federal agencies. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the use of diesel in fracturing operations. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for the SDWA’s Underground Injection Control Class II programs in Oklahoma, Texas or New Mexico where we maintain operational acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of such draft guidance. Also, the EPA is updating chloride water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic life under the Clean Water Act, which criteria are used by states for establishing acceptable discharge limits. The EPA is expected to release draft criteria in early 2016. On April 7, 2015, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule requiring federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater generated during the hydraulic fracturing process. Hydraulic fracturing stimulation requires the use of a significant volume of water with some resulting “flowback water” as well as “produced water.” If adopted, the new pretreatment rules will require shale gas operations to pretreat wastewater before transferring it to treatment facilities. The public comment period for the proposed rates ended on June 8, 2015 and final rules have not yet been issued. Moreover, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on its intent to develop and issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding the disclosure of information related to the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The public comment period ended on September 18, 2014.       In addition, on March 26, 2015, the federal Bureau of Land Management published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands, confirmation that wells used in fracturing operations meet appropriate construction standards, development of appropriate plans for managing flowback water that returns to the surface, increased standards for interim storage of recovered waste fluids, and submission to the Bureau of Land Management of detailed information on the geology, depth and location of preexisting wells. This rule originally was scheduled to take effect on June 24, 2015. However, the rule is the subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups, two Indian tribes, and at least four states, alleging that federal law does not give the Bureau of Land Management authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing. The federal judge has enjoined the rule until the merits of the case can be heard sometime in 2016.           34     Table of Contents    There are also certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The EPA’s draft report was released on June 4, 2015. The findings of the report suggest that hydraulic fracturing does not pose a systemic risk to groundwater although there are risks to both groundwater and soils posed by inadequate water handling practices in certain situations. A public comment period on the report was open until August 28, 2015 and a series of public hearings is being conducted by the EPA’s Scientific Advisory Board throughout the fall. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.       Additionally, Congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Most producing states, including Texas and Colorado, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether.        Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from dense subsurface rock formations and, in the event of local prohibitions against commercial production of natural gas, may preclude our ability to drill wells. In addition, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and result in permitting delays as well as potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.       Air quality regulations could negatively impact our operations and profitability.       In August 2012, the EPA adopted rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants programs. The rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establishes specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rules seek to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of these requests for reconsideration. In addition, on January 14, 2015, the EPA announced a series of steps it plans to take to address methane and smog-forming VOC emissions from the oil and gas industry. Final rules implementing the various elements of the package are all expected to be published before the end of 2015. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.       Regulation of disposal wells could negatively impact our operations and profitability.       On October 28, 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, amongst other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments also clarify the Commission’s authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The disposal well rule amendments became effective November 17, 2014. Furthermore, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of     35     Table of Contents    well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells. In Oklahoma, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has acted several times to address induced seismicity identifying a receiving formation and wells drilled to a certain depth as potentially increasing the likelihood of seismic activity. The Commission has created Areas of Interest in which operators must demonstrate they are not injecting at certain depths or at particular volumes. The Commission continues to monitor the situation and has stated they may take additional action if the situation warrants. Compliance with existing and potential future rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.       We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security, and our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected by such security threats and disruptions.   As an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats such as attempts to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering and processing facilities, pipelines and refineries; and threats from terrorist acts. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. While we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future.    We rely heavily on our information systems, and the availability and integrity of these systems are essential for us to conduct our business and operations. In addition to cybersecurity and data security threats, other information system failures and network disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. We could experience system failures due to power or telecommunications failures, human error, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunction or defects, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar acts or occurrences. Such system failures could result in the unanticipated disruption of our operations, communications or processing of transactions, as well as loss of, or damage to, sensitive information, facilities, infrastructure and systems essential to our business and operations, the failure to meet regulatory standards and the reporting of our financial results, and other disruptions to our operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.    While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing network security and internal control measures to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure, our implementation of such procedures and controls may result in increased costs, and there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not occur and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate any cybersecurity or information technology infrastructure vulnerabilities.          36     Table of Contents        ITEM 6.
