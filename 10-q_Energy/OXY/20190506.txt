Item 1A. Risk Factors Our proposal to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corporation may not be completed or completed on the terms and conditions contemplated, or with the anticipated benefits.We are currently pursuing a proposal to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko). Anadarko has engaged with Occidental with respect to our proposal but the ultimate outcome of any possible transaction between Occidental and Anadarko remains uncertain, including the possibility that Anadarko will reject the proposed transaction with Occidental or that the terms of any definitive agreement with Anadarko will be materially different than those described herein. In addition, if a definitive agreement with Anadarko is signed, the conditions to the closing of the proposed acquisition may not be obtained on the terms expected or on the anticipated schedule or at all.Occidental may be unable to achieve the expected synergies and operating efficiencies within the expected time-frames or at all and may not successfully integrate Anadarkoâ€™s operations with those of Occidental. Occidental may also be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service and repay the substantial indebtedness Occidental expects to incur in connection with the proposed transaction with Anadarko and to service the increased dividends that Occidental may be required to pay in connection with the Preferred Stock. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
