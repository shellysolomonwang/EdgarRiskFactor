Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following risk factor, in addition to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The proposed spin-off of our refining and marketing business is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, which may not be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or may not achieve the intended results.  We expect that the spin-off will be effective in the second quarter of 2012. Our ability to timely effect the spin-off is subject to several conditions, including among others, the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS, an independent tax opinion that the spin-off will qualify as tax-free and the SEC declaring effective a registration statement relating to the securities of the spun-off entity. We cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spin-off in a timely fashion, if at all. For these and other reasons, the spin-off may not be completed on the terms or timeline contemplated. Further, if the spin-off is completed, it may not achieve the intended results. Any such difficulties could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  There have been no other material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Item 2.
