Item 1A. RISK FACTORS  Except for the risk factor set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part I in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 (Form 10-K). The risk factor set forth below was disclosed in our Form 10-K, but has been updated to provide additional information.  Worldwide political and economic developments could damage our operations and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.  Local political and economic factors in international markets could have a material adverse effect on us. Approximately 63 percent of our crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production in 2007 was derived from production outside the United States, and 59 percent of our proved reserves, as of December 31, 2007, were located outside the United States.  There are many risks associated with operations in international markets, including changes in foreign governmental policies relating to crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or refined product pricing and taxation, other political, economic or diplomatic developments, changing political conditions and international monetary fluctuations. These risks include, among others:       •   Political and economic instability, war, acts of terrorism and civil disturbances.        •   The possibility that a foreign government may seize our property, with or without compensation, may attempt to renegotiate or revoke existing contractual arrangements and concessions, or may impose additional taxes or royalties.        •   Fluctuating currency values, hard currency shortages and currency controls.    Continued hostilities and turmoil in the world and the occurrence or threat of future terrorist attacks could affect the economies of the United States and other developed countries. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could cause our revenues and margins to decline and limit our future growth prospects. More specifically, our energy-related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets. A direct attack on our assets, or assets used by us, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These risks could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain the insurance coverage that we consider adequate.  Actions of the U.S., state and local governments through tax and other legislation, executive order and commercial restrictions could reduce our operating profitability both in the United States and abroad. The U.S. government can prevent or restrict us from doing business in foreign countries. These restrictions and those of foreign governments have in the past limited our ability to operate in, or gain access to, opportunities in various countries. Actions by both the United States and host governments have affected operations significantly in the past and will continue to do so in the future.  57    Table of Contents  We also are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not comprehensively hedge our exposure to currency rate changes, although we may choose to selectively hedge certain working capital balances, firm commitments, cash returns from affiliates and/or tax payments. These efforts may not be successful.  Recent disruptions in the credit markets and concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices, both of which have contributed to a decline in our stock price and corresponding market capitalization. Further stock price or commodity price decreases in the fourth quarter could result in noncash impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, as well as other-than-temporary noncash impairments of equity method investments. At December 31, 2007, we had $29.3 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations and $731 million of intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives. Decreased returns on pension fund assets may also materially increase our pension funding requirements.  Likewise, the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions. If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited, we, and third parties with whom we do business, may incur increased costs associated with issuing commercial paper and/or other debt instruments and this, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to advance our strategic plans as currently contemplated. In this context, changes in our debt rating could have a material adverse effect on our interest costs and financing sources. Our debt rating can be materially influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to, acquisitions, investment decisions, and capital management activities.     Item 2.

On February 9, 2007, we announced plans to repurchase $4 billion of our common stock in 2007, including the $1 billion announced on January 12, 2007. On July 9, 2007, we announced plans to repurchase up to $15 billion of the company’s common stock through the end of 2008, which included the $2 billion remaining under the previously announced $4 billion program. Acquisitions for the share repurchase programs are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the plans are held as treasury shares.   58    Table of Contents     Item 5. OTHER INFORMATION  On October 29, 2008, following receipt of approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board, we closed on a transaction with Origin Energy to create a long-term Australasian natural gas business. The 50/50 joint venture will focus on coalbed methane production from the Bowen and Surat basins in Queensland, Australia, and liquefied natural gas processing and export sales. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid $5 billion at closing.  Our initial payment was funded through cash on hand as well as the issuance of approximately $4.9 billion in commercial paper borrowings under our commercial paper program as described in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the section entitled “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Significant Sources of Capital – Commercial Paper and Credit Facilities” on page 46, which is incorporated herein by reference. Interest rates on commercial paper borrowings are subject to conditions of the short-term money markets.     Item 6. EXHIBITS
