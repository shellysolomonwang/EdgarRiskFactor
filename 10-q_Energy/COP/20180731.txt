On November 10, 2016, we announced plans to purchase up to $3 billion of our common stock through 2019. On March 29, 2017, we announced plans to double our share repurchase program to $6 billion of common stock through 2019, with $3 billion allocated and purchased in 2017, and the remainder allocated evenly to 2018 and 2019. On February 1, 2018, we announced the acceleration of our previously stated 2018 share repurchases from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. On July 12, 2018, we announced plans to further accelerate our 2018 share repurchases to $3 billion. The 2018 expansion to $3 billion, combined with the $3 billion of shares repurchased during 2016 and 2017, will fully utilize the Board of Directors’ existing share repurchase authorization of $6 billion. As a result, our Board has authorized an additional $9 billion for share repurchases, at any time or from time to time (whether before, on or after December 31, 2019), bringing the total program authorization to $15 billion. Acquisitions for the share repurchase program are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the plan are held as treasury shares. See the “Our ability to declare and pay dividends and repurchase shares is subject to certain considerations” section in Risk Factors on pages 20–21 of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    64    Table of Contents   Item 6.
