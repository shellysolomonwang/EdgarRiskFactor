Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, other than the risks described below relating to the proposed Rice Merger.Our acquisition of Rice Energy Inc. (Rice) is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the acquisition of Rice could have a material and adverse effect on us.Completion of our acquisition of Rice is subject to a number of conditions set forth in our merger agreement with Rice, including the approval by our shareholders of the issuance of shares of our common stock as acquisition consideration and approval by Rice stockholders of the adoption of the merger agreement, which make the completion and timing of the completion of the transactions uncertain. Also, either EQT or Rice may terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not been consummated by February 19, 2018 (or, at either party’s discretion, if the only conditions to closing that have not been satisfied or waived by that date are those related to the termination or expiration of any waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 or the issuance of an order, decree, ruling, injunction or other action that is in effect and is restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger by May 19, 2018) except that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose material breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such party under the merger agreement resulted in the failure of the transactions to be consummated on or before that date.If the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the transactions, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:•we will be required to pay our costs relating to the transactions, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the transactions are completed;•time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the transactions could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;•the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the transactions will be completed; and•if the merger agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another acquisition, our shareholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction as attractive to us as the acquisition of Rice.If the acquisition of Rice is completed, we may not achieve the intended benefits and the acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations.There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate Rice’s assets or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. In addition, our business may be negatively impacted following the acquisition if we are unable to effectively manage our expanded operations. The integration will require significant time and focus from management following the acquisition. Additionally, consummating the acquisition could disrupt current plans and operations, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives.43Table of ContentsItem 2.
