Item 1A. Risk Factors   You should consider carefully the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this report and other reports filed with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, before investing in our shares. Any information presented in this report on a pro forma basis has been prepared as if (a) the closing of the acquisition of Henry Petroleum LP, certain affiliated entities and the related along-side interests, (b) entering into our new credit facility and (c) issuance of our common stock in the private placement occurred on January 1, 2007.   If any of the following risks were actually to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.  Risks Related to Our Business  Crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile. A decline in crude oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our financial position, financial results, cash flow, access to capital and ability to grow.   Our future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production and the prices prevailing from time to time for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical conditions. This price volatility also affects the amount of our cash flow we have available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The prices for crude oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors, including:       •   the level of consumer demand for crude oil and natural gas;        •   the domestic and foreign supply of crude oil and natural gas;        •   commodity processing, gathering and transportation availability, and the availability of refining capacity;        •   the price and level of imports of foreign crude oil and natural gas;        •   the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain crude oil price and production controls;        •   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;        •   the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;        •   weather conditions;        •   political conditions or hostilities in oil and gas producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa and South America;        •   technological advances affecting energy consumption; and        •   worldwide economic conditions.    49    Table of Contents      Furthermore, recent crude oil and natural gas prices have been particularly volatile. For example, the NYMEX crude oil spot price for the period between January 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 has ranged from a high of $145.29 to a low of $62.73 and the NYMEX natural gas spot price for the period between January 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 has ranged from a high of $13.58 to a low of $6.12.   Declines in crude oil and natural gas prices would not only reduce our revenue, but could reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and reserves. If the oil and gas industry experiences significant price declines, we may, among other things, be unable to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness or obtain additional capital on attractive terms, all of which can affect the value of our common stock.  Drilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could cause our expenses to increase or our cash flows and production volumes to decrease.   Our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploitation, exploration, development and production activities. Our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable crude oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical or less economic than forecasted. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following:       •   delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory and contractual requirements;        •   pressure or irregularities in geological formations;        •   shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;        •   equipment failures or accidents;        •   adverse weather conditions;        •   reductions in crude oil and natural gas prices;        •   surface access restrictions;        •   loss of title or other title related issues;        •   crude oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas gathering, transportation and processing availability restrictions or limitations; and        •   limitations in the market for crude oil and natural gas.    Estimates of proved reserves and future net cash flows are not precise. The actual quantities of our proved reserves and our future net cash flows may prove to be lower than estimated.   Numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net cash flows therefrom. Our estimates of proved reserves and related future net cash flows are based on various assumptions, which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.   Petroleum engineering is a subjective process of estimating accumulations of crude oil and/or natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including the following:       •   historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;        •   the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;    50    Table of Contents      •   the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;        •   the quality, quantity and interpretation of available relevant data;        •   the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;        •   assumptions concerning future commodity prices; and        •   assumptions concerning future operating costs; severance, ad valorem and excise taxes; development costs; and workover and remedial costs.     Because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items, or other items not identified below, may differ materially from those assumed in estimating reserves:       •   the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered;        •   the production and operating costs incurred;        •   the amount and timing of future development expenditures; and        •   future commodity prices.     Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data. Our actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material.   As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. For example, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves at December 31, 2007 were calculated using $92.50 per Bb1 Plains Marketing, L.P. West Texas Intermediate posted crude oil price and $6.795 per MMBtu NYMEX Henry Hub spot natural gas price, adjusted for location and quality by field, while the actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as:       •   the amount and timing of actual production;        •   levels of future capital spending;        •   increases or decreases in the supply of or demand for oil and gas; and        •   changes in governmental regulations or taxation.     Standardized Measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. It requires the use of commodity prices, as well as operating and development costs, prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for crude oil and natural gas production because of seasonal price fluctuations or other varying market conditions, nor may it reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and gas properties. Accordingly, estimates included herein of future net cash flows may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. In addition, the ten percent discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our company or the oil and gas industry in general. Therefore, the estimates of discounted future net cash flows or Standardized Measure included herein should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current market value of our proved reserves.  Our business requires substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a decline in our crude oil and natural gas reserves.   The oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves. At September 30, 2008, total debt outstanding under our credit facility was $635.0 million, and $324.7 million was available to be borrowed. Expenditures for exploration and development of oil and gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources. On a pro forma basis, we invested approximately  51    Table of Contents  $250 million in 2007 and anticipate investing over $400 million in 2008 for acquisition, exploration and development activities on our properties, excluding the cost of the acquisition of Henry Petroleum LP, certain affiliated entities and the related acquisition of the along-side interests.   We intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and through borrowings under our credit facility; however, our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities. The issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of our outstanding common stock. Additional borrowings under our credit facility or the issuance of additional debt will require that a greater portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. In addition, our credit facility imposes certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness other than indebtedness under our credit facility. If we desire to issue additional debt securities other than as expressly permitted under our credit facility, we will be required to seek the consent of the lenders in accordance with the requirements of the facility, which consent may be withheld by the lenders under our credit facility in their discretion. Additional financing also may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event additional capital resources are unavailable, we may curtail drilling, development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis.   Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:       •   our proved reserves;        •   the level of crude oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;        •   the prices at which our crude oil and natural gas are sold; and        •   our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.     If our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. As a result, we may require additional capital to fund our operations, and we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing to satisfy our capital requirements. If cash generated from operations or cash available under our revolving credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves, and could adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.  We may not be able to obtain funding at all, or obtain funding on acceptable terms, to meet our future capital needs because of the deterioration of the credit and capital markets.   Global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and will likely continue to be, disrupted and volatile. The debt and equity capital markets have become uncertain. These issues, along with significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk and the current weak economic conditions have made, and will likely continue to make, it difficult to obtain funding.   In particular, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets has diminished significantly. Also, as a result of concern about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards and reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers.   In addition, our ability to obtain capital under our credit facility may be impaired because of the recent downturn in the financial market, including the issues surrounding the solvency of certain institutional lenders and the recent failure of several banks.   Specifically, we may be unable to obtain adequate funding under our credit facility because:       •   our lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations;        •   the borrowing base under our credit facility is redetermined at least twice a year and may decrease due to a decrease in crude oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, or for other reasons; or    52    Table of Contents      •   if any lender is unable or unwilling to fund their respective portion of any advance under our credit facility, then the other lenders thereunder are not required to provide additional funding to make up the portion of the advance that the defaulting lender refused to fund.     Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our development plan, enhance our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.  Almost all of our producing properties are located in the Permian Basin region of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area.   Our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin region of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. On a pro forma basis, at December 31, 2007, approximately 99% of our PV-10 was attributable to properties located in the Permian Basin. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, curtailment of production or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids produced from the wells in this area.   In addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, on a pro forma basis, at December 31, 2007, approximately (i) 46% of our proved reserves were attributable to the Yeso formation, which includes both the Paddock and Blinebry intervals, underlying our oil and gas properties located in Southeast New Mexico; and (ii) 15% of our proved reserves were attributable to the Wolfberry play in West Texas, which is the term applied to combined production from the Wolfcamp and Spraberry horizons in this area of the Permian Basin, a play in which we acquired interests as a result of the acquisition of Henry Petroleum LP, certain affiliated entities and the related acquisition of the along-side interests. This concentration of assets within a small number of producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.  Future price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   Declines in commodity prices may result in having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of production or economic factors change, accounting rules may require us to write-down, as a noncash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for impairments. We are required to perform impairment tests on proved assets whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our proved oil and gas properties. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our oil and gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore require a write-down. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could materially affect our results of operations in the period incurred.  Part of our strategy involves exploratory drilling, including drilling in new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.   The results of our exploratory drilling in new or emerging areas are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and have established production. Since new or emerging plays and new formations have limited or no production history, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. As a result, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.  Our commodity price risk management program may cause us to forego additional future profits or result in our making cash payments to our counterparties.   To reduce our exposure to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, we have entered into and may in the future enter into additional commodity price risk management arrangements for a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production. The agreements that we have entered into generally have the effect of providing us with a fixed price for a portion of our expected future crude oil and natural gas production over a fixed period of time. Commodity price risk management arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss and may limit our ability to benefit from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices in some circumstances, including the following:  53    Table of Contents       •   the counterparty to a commodity price risk management contract may default on its contractual obligations to us;        •   there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in a commodity price risk management agreement and actual prices received; or        •   market prices may exceed the prices which we are contracted to receive, resulting in our need to make significant cash payments to our counterparties.     Our commodity price risk management activities could have the effect of reducing our revenues, net income and the value of our common stock. At September 30, 2008, the net unrealized loss on our commodity price risk management contracts was approximately $18.8 million. An average increase in the commodity price of $1.00 per barrel of crude oil and $0.10 per Mcf for natural gas from the commodity prices at September 30, 2008 would have resulted in an increase in the net unrealized loss on our commodity price risk management contracts, as reflected on our balance sheet at September 30, 2008, of approximately $5.0 million. We may continue to incur significant unrealized losses in the future from our commodity price risk management activities to the extent market prices increase and our derivatives contracts remain in place.  We may enter into interest rate derivative instruments that would subject us to potential loss of income.   We may enter into derivative instruments designed to limit the interest rate risk under our current credit facility or any credit facilities we may enter into in the future. These derivative instruments would primarily involve the exchange of a portion of our floating rate interest obligations for fixed rate interest obligations or a cap on our exposure to floating interest rates to reduce our exposure to the volatility of interest rates. While we may enter into instruments limiting our exposure to higher market interest rates, we cannot assure you that any interest rate derivative instruments we implement will be effective; and furthermore, even if effective these instruments may not offer complete protection from the risk of higher interest rates.   All interest rate derivative instruments involve certain additional risks, such as:       •   the counterparty may default on its contractual obligations to us;        •   there may be issues with regard to the legal enforceability of such instruments;        •   the early repayment of one of our interest rate derivative instruments could lead to prepayment penalties; or        •   unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates may cause a significant loss of basis in the instrument and a change in current period expense.    If we enter into derivative instruments that require us to post cash collateral, our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced, which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures.   The use of derivatives may, in some cases, require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties. If we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral and commodity prices or interest rates change in a manner adverse to us, our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced, which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures. Future collateral requirements will depend on arrangements with our counterparties and highly volatile crude oil and natural gas prices and interest rates.  Our identified inventory of drilling locations and recompletion opportunities are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.   Our management has specifically identified and scheduled the drilling and recompletion of our drilling and recompletion opportunities as an estimation of our future multi-year development activities on our existing acreage. On a pro forma basis, at June 30, 2008, we had identified 3,293 drilling locations with proved undeveloped reserves attributable to 967 of such locations, and 1,389 recompletion opportunities with proved undeveloped reserves attributed to 588 of such opportunities. These identified opportunities represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these opportunities depends on a number of uncertainties, including (1) our ability to timely drill wells on lands subject to complex development terms and circumstances; and (2) the availability of capital, equipment, services and personnel, seasonal conditions, regulatory and third party approvals, crude oil and natural gas prices, and drilling and recompletion costs results. Because of these uncertainties, we may never drill or recomplete the numerous potential opportunities we have identified or produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other  54    Table of Contents  potential opportunities. As such, our actual development activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.  On a pro forma basis, approximately 44% of our total estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2007, were undeveloped, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed.   On a pro forma basis, at December 31, 2007, approximately 44% of our total estimated net proved reserves were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling. Our reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove correct. If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not able to successfully develop these reserves, we will be required to write-off these reserves. Any such write-offs of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow money and could reduce the value of our common stock.  Because we do not control the development of the properties in which we own interests, but do not operate, we may not be able to achieve any production from these properties in a timely manner.   On a pro forma basis, at December 31, 2007, approximately 9% of our PV-10 was attributable to properties for which we were not the operator. As a result, the success and timing of drilling and development activities on such nonoperated properties depend upon a number of factors, including:       •   the nature and timing of drilling and operational activities;        •   the timing and amount of capital expenditures;        •   the operators’ expertise and financial resources;        •   the approval of other participants in such properties; and        •   the selection of suitable technology.     If drilling and development activities are not conducted on these properties or are not conducted on a timely basis, we may be unable to increase our production or offset normal production declines, which may adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.  Unless we replace our crude oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to raise capital and the value of our common stock.   Unless we conduct successful development, exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future crude oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. The value of our common stock and our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace our reserves that are depleted by production. We may not be able to develop, exploit, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production.  We may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or integrate acquired companies, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow through the acquisition of businesses.   One aspect of our business strategy calls for acquisitions of businesses that complement or expand our current business. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive candidates, we may not be able to complete the acquisition of them or do so on commercially acceptable terms.   In addition, our credit facility imposes certain direct limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions involving our company. Our credit facility also limits our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses. If we desire to engage in an acquisition that is otherwise prohibited by our credit facility, we will be required to seek the consent of our lenders in accordance with the requirements of the facility, which consent may be withheld  55    Table of Contents  by the lenders under our credit facility in their discretion. Furthermore, given the current situation in the credit markets, many leaders are reluctant to provide consents in any circumstances, including to allow accretive transactions.   If we acquire another business, we could have difficulty integrating its operations, systems, management and other personnel and technology with our own. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we may incur additional debt or issue additional equity to pay for any future acquisitions, subject to the limitations described above.  If we are unable to integrate Henry Petroleum LP, the affiliated entities and the related along-side interests as expected, our future financial performance may be negatively impacted.   The integration of acquired businesses and operations with our existing business and operations has been and will continue to be a complex, time-consuming and costly process, specifically including the Henry Entities’ businesses and operations, given that Henry Petroleum LP, the affiliated entities and the related along-side interests substantially increased our size and diversified the geographic areas in which we operate. A failure to successfully integrate the Henry Entities’ businesses and operations with our existing and other business and operations in a timely manner may have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. The difficulties of combining the acquired operations include, among other things:       •   operating a larger combined organization and adding operations;        •   difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business;        •   vendor or key employee losses from the acquired business;        •   changes in key supply relationships related to the acquired business;        •   integrating personnel from diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures;        •   developing and maintaining an effective system of internal controls related to the acquired business;        •   integrating internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other regulatory compliance and corporate governance matters;        •   an inability to complete other internal growth projects and/or acquisitions due to constraints on time and resources;        •   difficulties integrating new technology systems that we have not historically used in our operations or financial reporting;        •   an increase in our indebtedness;        •   potential environmental or regulatory compliance matters or liabilities including, but not limited to potential matters associated with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and title issues, including liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired business before the acquisition; and        •   coordinating and consolidating corporate and administrative functions.     Further, unexpected costs, liabilities and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing, or a reduction or elimination of, the expected benefits of the acquisition.  The acquisition of Henry Petroleum LP, certain affiliated entities and the related acquisition of the along-side interests could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.   In connection with the acquisition of Henry Petroleum LP, certain affiliated entities and the related acquisition of the along-side interests, we purchased all of the sellers’ interests in the Henry Entities, rather than individual assets; therefore, the Henry Entities retained their liabilities, subject to certain exclusions and limitations contained in the purchase agreement, including certain unknown and contingent liabilities. We performed due diligence in connection with the acquisition of Henry Petroleum LP, certain affiliated  56    Table of Contents  entities and the related acquisition of the along-side interests and attempted to verify the representations of the sellers and of the former management of the Henry Entities, but there may be threatened, contemplated or contingent claims against the Henry Entities related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware. Although the sellers agreed to indemnify us on a limited basis against certain liabilities, these indemnification obligations will expire over time and expose us to unindemnified liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.  Properties acquired may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities.   We obtained the majority of our current reserve base through acquisitions of producing properties and undeveloped acreage, including those owned by the Henry Entities. We expect acquisitions will continue to contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions of oil and gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering reserves, exploration potential, future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and we cannot make these assessments with a high degree of accuracy. In connection with our assessments, we perform a review of the acquired properties. However, such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not inspect every well. Even when we inspect a well, we do not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise.   We are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Normally, we acquire interests in properties on an “as is” basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties.  Competition in the oil and gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.   We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing crude oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, those companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. The cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the past few years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital. Our failure to acquire properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel and increased compensation for trained personnel could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.  Shortages of oilfield equipment, services and qualified personnel could delay our drilling program and increase the prices we pay to obtain such equipment, services and personnel.   The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with crude oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling and workover rigs, pipe and other oilfield equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher crude oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling and workover rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. It is beyond our control and ability to predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results, or restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned and budgeted or which we may plan in the future.  Our exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.   Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be encountered. New wells that we drill may not be productive, or we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that crude oil or natural gas is present or may be produced economically. Drilling for crude oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry holes  57    Table of Contents  but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:       •   unexpected drilling conditions;        •   title problems;        •   pressure or lost circulation in formations;        •   equipment failures or accidents;        •   adverse weather conditions;        •   compliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements; and        •   increases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment and services.    We periodically evaluate our unproved oil and gas properties, and could be required to recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.   At September 30, 2008, we carried unproved property costs of $445.4 million. GAAP requires periodic evaluation of these costs on a project-by-project basis in comparison to their estimated fair value. These evaluations will be affected by the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of the leases, contracts and permits appurtenant to such projects. If the quantity of potential reserves determined by such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project, we will recognize noncash charges in the earnings of future periods.  We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our crude oil and natural gas operations. In addition, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.   We are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:       •   environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;        •   abnormally pressured or structured formations;        •   mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;        •   fires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;        •   personal injuries and death; and        •   natural disasters.     Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:       •   injury or loss of life;        •   damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;        •   pollution and other environmental damage;    58    Table of Contents      •   regulatory investigations and penalties;        •   suspension of our operations; and        •   repair and remediation costs.     We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.  Market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to crude oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.   Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory crude oil and natural gas processing or transportation arrangements may hinder our access to crude oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of crude oil and natural gas, the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities, competition for such facilities and the inability of such facilities to gather, transport or process our production due to shutdowns or curtailments arising from mechanical, operational or weather related matters, including hurricanes and other severe weather conditions. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering and transportation systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas pipeline or gathering, transportation or processing capacity. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until suitable arrangements were made to market our production.  We are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, timing, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.   Our crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and saltwater disposal operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state, local and governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs and experience delays in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase or our operations may be otherwise adversely affected if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. These and other costs could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.   Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, and the production of, crude oil and natural gas. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.  Our operations expose us to significant costs and liabilities with respect to environmental and operational safety matters.   We may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety requirements applicable to our crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and saltwater disposal activities. These delays, costs and liabilities could arise under a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, health and safety, including regulations and enforcement policies that have tended to become increasingly strict over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, and, to a lesser extent, issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations.   Strict as well as joint and several liability may be imposed under certain environmental laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. New laws, regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs. If we were not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues, our production, revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.  59    Table of Contents  The loss of our chief executive officer or our chief operating officer or other key personnel could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy.   We depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services of Timothy A. Leach, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Steven L. Beal, our president and chief operating officer, our other executive officers and our key employees who have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing producing oil and gas properties and drilling prospects, maximizing production from oil and gas properties, marketing oil and gas production, and developing and executing acquisition, financing and hedging strategies. Our ability to hire and retain our officers and key employees is important to our continued success and growth. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy.  Uncertainties associated with enhanced recovery methods may result in us not realizing an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.   We inject water into formations on some of our properties to increase the production of crude oil and natural gas. We may in the future expand these efforts to more of our properties or employ other enhanced recovery methods in our operations. The additional production and reserves attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of crude oil and natural gas in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.  Our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.   We now have, and will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness, and the terms of our credit facility require us to pay higher interest rate margins as we utilize a larger percentage of our available borrowing base. At September 30, 2008, our total debt was $635.0 million. Assuming our total debt outstanding at September 30, 2008 was held constant, if interest rates had been higher or lower by 1% per annum, our annual interest expense would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.4 million. At September 30, 2008, our total borrowing capacity under our credit facility was $960 million, of which $324.7 million was available.   Our current and future indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:       •   impair our ability to make investments and obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;        •   limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;        •   limit our ability to borrow funds that may be necessary to operate or expand our business;        •   put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have less debt;        •   increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases; and        •   hinder our ability to adjust to rapidly changing economic and industry conditions.     Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we can successfully implement our business strategy. We may not be able to implement or realize the benefits of our business strategy.  Our credit facility imposes restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business.   Our credit facility limits our ability to take various actions, such as:       •   incurring additional indebtedness;        •   paying dividends;        •   creating certain additional liens on our assets;    60    Table of Contents      •   entering into sale and leaseback transactions;        •   making investments;        •   entering into transactions with affiliates;        •   making material changes to the type of business we conduct or our business structure;        •   making guarantees;        •   disposing of assets in excess of certain permitted amounts;        •   merging or consolidating with other entities; and        •   selling all or substantially all of our assets.     In addition, our credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial conditions, which may require us to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with each of them.   These restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We also may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our credit facility.  A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business by decreasing our revenues and increasing our costs.   Terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflict involving the United States may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur or escalate, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for crude oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenue. Crude oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if significant infrastructure or facilities we use for the production, transportation or marketing of our crude oil and natural gas production are destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.  Risks Relating to Our Common Stock  Our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.   Our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders, including:       •   the organization of our board of directors as a classified board, which allows no more than approximately one-third of our directors to be elected each year;        •   stockholders cannot remove directors from our board of directors except for cause and then only by the holders of not less than  66 2/3 % of the voting power of all outstanding voting stock;        •   the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent; and        •   limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings and establish advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders.    61    Table of Contents  Because we have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us.   We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain all future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. The terms of our existing credit facility restricts the payment of dividends without the prior written consent of the lenders. Stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.  The availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.   In the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for acquisitions, the payment of our indebtedness or other purposes. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or solely our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in us and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.   In addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.     Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
