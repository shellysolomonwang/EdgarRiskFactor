Item 1A. Risk Factors   In addition to the risk factor set forth below and the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risks discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, under the headings “Item 1. Business — Competition,” “— Marketing Arrangements” and “— Applicable Laws and Regulations,” “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” which risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, other than updating the risk factor below. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. The updated risk factor is as follows:   Future price declines could result in a reduction in the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties, which could adversely affect our results of operations.   Declines in commodity prices may result in us having to make substantial downward adjustments to the value of our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of production or economic factors change, accounting rules may require us to write-down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairments. We are required to perform impairment tests on proved assets whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our proved oil and natural gas properties. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore require a write-down. The primary factors that may affect management’s estimates of future cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) cash flows from integrated assets and (v) results of future drilling activities. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period incurred.  56         Item 2.
