Item 1A. Risk Factors  Information about risk factors does not differ materially from the discussion found in Item 1A of the registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2009. Recent events in the Gulf of Mexico illustrate the magnitude of the operational risks inherent in oil and gas exploration and production activities, as well as the potential to incur substantial financial liabilities if those risks are not effectively managed. The ability to insure such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets, which may not be sufficient to cover the likely cost of a major adverse operating event such as a deepwater well blowout. Accordingly, ExxonMobil’s primary focus is on prevention, including through our rigorous Operations Integrity Management System. Our future results will depend on the continued effectiveness of these efforts.  The Gulf of Mexico spill may result in changes to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations which would have the effect of increasing the cost of, and reducing available opportunities for, offshore exploration and production.
