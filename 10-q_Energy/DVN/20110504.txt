CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)  1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes of Devon Energy Corporation (“Devon”) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Devon’s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements furnished in this report reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of Devon’s financial position as of March 31, 2011 and Devon’s results of operations and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.   2. Accounts Receivable    The components of accounts receivable include the following:                              March 31, 2011     December 31, 2010         (In millions)       Oil, gas and NGL sales   $ 811     $ 786     Marketing and midstream revenues     204       165     Joint interest billings     181       182     Other     83       79                     Gross accounts receivable     1,279       1,212     Allowance for doubtful accounts     (10 )     (10 )                   Net accounts receivable   $ 1,269     $ 1,202                        3. Derivative Financial Instruments   Objectives and Strategies   Devon periodically enters into commodity and interest rate derivative financial instruments. These instruments are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues due to oil, gas and NGL price volatility and to manage exposure to interest rate volatility. Devon does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and has elected not to designate any of its derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment.   Devon’s derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps, costless price collars and call options. Under the terms of the price swaps, Devon receives a fixed price for its production and pays a variable market price to the contract counterparty. For the basis swaps, Devon receives a fixed differential between two regional gas index prices and pays a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. The price collars set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon will cash-settle the difference with the counterparty to the collars. Under the terms of the call options, Devon sold to counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price.   Devon periodically enters into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility. Devon’s interest rate swaps include contracts in which Devon receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate on a total notional amount. Devon also has forward starting swaps. Under the terms of the forward starting swaps, Devon will net settle these contracts in September 2011 or sooner should Devon elect. The net settlement amount will be based upon Devon paying a fixed rate and receiving a floating rate that is based upon the three-month LIBOR. The difference between the fixed and floating rate will be applied to the notional amount for the 30-year period from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2041.  Counterparty Risk   By using derivative financial instruments to manage exposures to changes in commodity prices and interest rates, Devon  10    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)  (Unaudited)  exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are placed with a number of counterparties whom Devon believes are minimal credit risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers. Additionally, Devon’s derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either its or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade. The mark-to-market exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted, decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to $50 million for the majority of Devon’s contracts. As of March 31, 2011, the credit ratings of all Devon’s counterparties were investment grade.  Commodity Derivatives   As of March 31, 2011, Devon had the following open oil derivative positions:                                                                  Production                     Period   Price Swaps     Price Collars     Call Options Sold                 Weighted             Weighted     Weighted             Weighted         Volume     Average Price     Volume     Average Floor Price     Average Ceiling Price     Volume     Average Price     Period   (Bbls/d)     ($/Bbl)     (Bbls/d)     ($/Bbl)     ($/Bbl)     (Bbls/d)     ($/Bbl)       Q2-Q4 2011     —       —       45,000     $ 75.00     $ 108.89       19,500     $ 95.00     Q1-Q4 2012     9,000     $ 104.20       35,000     $ 82.14     $ 126.42       19,500     $ 95.00        As of March 31, 2011, Devon had the following open natural gas derivative positions:                                                                  Production                     Period   Price Swaps     Price Collars     Call Options Sold                 Weighted             Weighted     Weighted             Weighted         Volume     Average Price     Volume     Average Floor Price     Average Ceiling Price     Volume     Average Price     Period   (MMBtu/d)     ($/MMBtu)     (MMBtu/d)     ($/MMBtu)     ($/MMBtu)     (MMBtu/d)     ($/MMBtu)       Q2 2011     912,500     $ 5.24       350,000     $ 4.18     $ 4.68       —       —     Q3 2011     712,500     $ 5.51       —       —       —       —       —     Q4 2011     712,500     $ 5.51       —       —       —       —       —     Q1-Q4 2012     130,000     $ 5.06       —       —       —       487,500     $ 6.00                                       Basis Swaps                         Weighted Average                         Differential to                 Volume     Henry Hub     Production Period   Index     (MMBtu/d)     ($/MMBtu)       Q2-Q4 2011   Panhandle Eastern Pipeline     150,000     $ 0.33        As of March 31, 2011, Devon had the following open NGL derivative positions:                                  Basis Swaps                         Weighted Average                 Volume     Differential to WTI     Production Period   Pay     (Bbls/d)     ($/Bbl)       Q2-Q4 2011   Natural Gasoline     500     $ 9.75     Q1-Q4 2012   Natural Gasoline     500     $ 10.10     Q1-Q4 2013   Natural Gasoline     500     $ 6.80       11    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)  (Unaudited)  Interest Rate Derivatives   As of March 31, 2011, Devon had the following open interest rate swap derivative positions:                                  Fixed-to-Floating Swaps         Fixed Rate     Variable           Notional   Received     Rate Paid     Expiration     (In millions)                             $300     4.30 %   Six month LIBOR   July 18, 2011    100     1.90 %   Federal funds rate   August 3, 2012    500     3.90 %   Federal funds rate   July 18, 2013    250     3.85 %   Federal funds rate   July 22, 2013                         $1,150     3.82 %                                                                           Forward Starting Swaps         Fixed Rate     Variable           Notional   Paid     Rate Received     Expiration     (In millions)                           $950     3.92 %   Three month LIBOR   September 30, 2011     Financial Statement Presentation   The following table presents the derivative fair values included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Other Current Assets    The components of other current assets include the following:                              March 31, 2011     December 31, 2010         (In millions)       Income taxes receivable   $ 374     $ 270     Derivative financial instruments     295       348     Inventories     116       120     Other     65       41                     Other current assets   $ 850     $ 779                        5. Goodwill    During the first three months of 2011, Devon’s Canadian goodwill increased $71 million entirely due to foreign currency translation.   6. Debt   Credit Lines   Devon has a $2,650 million syndicated, unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Senior Credit Facility”). As of March 31, 2011, Devon had no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.   The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devon’s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65 percent. The credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Also, total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of March 31, 2011, Devon was in compliance with this covenant. Devon’s debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2011, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 17.7 percent.  Commercial Paper   In March 2011, Devon’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in its commercial paper program from $2.2 billion to $5.0 billion. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between one and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The interest rate is based on a standard index such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper market.   Although Devon began and ended the first quarter of 2011 with approximately $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, the vast majority of this amount consists of proceeds from its 2010 International divestitures. Based on Devon’s evaluation of future cash needs across its operations in the United States and Canada, these proceeds remain outside of the United States.   Consequently, during the first quarter of 2011, Devon borrowed $1,197 million of commercial paper in the United States primarily to fund capital expenditures, common stock repurchases and dividends in excess of cash flow generated by its United States operating activities. As of March 31, 2011, Devon’s average borrowing rate on its $1,197 million of commercial paper borrowings was 0.30 percent.  13    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)  (Unaudited)   7. Asset Retirement Obligations    The schedule below summarizes changes in Devon’s asset retirement obligations.

The increase was primarily due to an overall increase in abandonment cost estimates and a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the obligations.   8. Retirement Plans    The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit cost for Devon’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Devon now expects to contribute $346 million to its qualified pension plans in 2011, including $32 million that was contributed in the first quarter. The increase in Devon’s 2011 estimated contribution is due to increased discretionary funding.   9. Stockholders’ Equity   Stock Repurchases   During the first quarter of 2011, Devon repurchased 8.1 million common shares under its $3.5 billion stock repurchase program announced in 2010 for $696 million, or $85.95 per share. Through the end of the first quarter of 2011, Devon had repurchased 26.4 million common shares for $1.9 billion, or $71.83 per share, under this program, which expires December 31, 2011.  14    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)  (Unaudited)  Dividends   Devon paid common stock dividends of $68 million and $72 million (quarterly rates of $0.16 per share) in the first quarter of 2011 and 2010, respectively. In March 2011, Devon announced an increase of its quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share that will begin in the second quarter of 2011.   10. Commitments and Contingencies    Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to Devon’s financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals although actual amounts could differ materially from management’s estimate.  Environmental Matters   Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these activities, loss accruals primarily consist of estimated uninsured costs associated with remediation. Devon’s monetary exposure for environmental matters is not expected to be material.  Royalty Matters   Numerous natural gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers and related parties used below-market prices, improper deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates, which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and NGLs produced and sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure with respect to such royalty matters.  Other Matters   Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject.   11. Fair Value Measurements    Certain of Devon’s assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Such assets and liabilities include amounts for both financial and non-financial instruments. The following tables provide carrying value and fair value measurement information for Devon’s financial assets and liabilities.  15    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)  (Unaudited)   The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current receivables, accounts payable and other current payables and accrued expenses included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

Restructuring Costs    In the fourth quarter of 2009, Devon announced plans to divest its offshore assets. As of March 31, 2011, Devon had divested all of its U.S. Offshore assets and a significant part of its International assets. Devon has entered into agreements to sell its remaining offshore assets in Brazil and Angola and is waiting for the respective governments to approve the divestitures.   Through the end of the first quarter of 2011, Devon had incurred $207 million of restructuring costs associated with these divestitures. This amount is comprised of $127 million of employee severance costs, $77 million associated with abandoned office leases and $3 million of other miscellaneous costs.

These excluded options totaled 3.1 million and 6.4 million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  18    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)  (Unaudited)   15. Segment Information    Devon manages its North American onshore operations through distinct operating segments, or divisions, which are defined primarily by geographic areas. For financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its United States divisions into one reporting segment due to the similar nature of the businesses. However, Devon’s Canadian and International divisions are reported as separate reporting segments primarily due to significant differences in the respective regulatory environments.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   The following discussion and analysis addresses material changes in our results of operations and capital resources and uses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, and in our financial condition and liquidity since December 31, 2010. For information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  Financial Overview   During the first three months of 2011 and 2010, we generated net earnings of $416 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, and $1.2 billion, or $2.66 per diluted share, for the respective periods. The primary drivers for the decrease in earnings were unrealized gains recognized on our commodity hedges in 2010 and lower gas prices in 2011. In addition, the 2010 results include operating earnings from our offshore properties that were divested subsequent to the first quarter of 2010.   Key measures of our financial performance for the first three months of 2011 compared to the first three months of 2010 are summarized below:       •   North America Onshore oil and NGL production increased 11% to 19 MMBbls.         •   North America Onshore gas production increased 5% to 228 Bcf.         •   The combined realized price without hedges for oil, gas and NGLs decreased 11% to $32.86 per Boe.         •   Oil, gas and NGL derivatives incurred a net loss of $168 million in the first three months of 2011 and generated a net gain of $620 million in the first three months of 2010. Included in these amounts were cash receipts of $86 million and $96 million, respectively.         •   Marketing and midstream operating profit decreased 9% to $122 million.         •   Per unit operating costs increased 1% to $7.48 per Boe.         •   Operating cash flow decreased 16% to $1.3 billion.         •   Capital spending totaled approximately $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2011.     Our performance and the proceeds from our previous offshore divestitures have allowed us to maintain a robust level of liquidity. As of March 31, 2011, we held $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, access to short-term commercial paper borrowings and our $2.7 billion credit facility. With this liquidity, we continue executing our exploration and development programs, with a focus on growing our liquids production, and repurchasing common shares under our $3.5 billion share repurchase program. Through April 25, 2011, we had repurchased 28.3 million shares for $2.1 billion, or $72.98 per share.  First-Quarter Operating Highlights       •   Production from our Cana-Woodford Shale play averaged a record 162 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2011. This represents a 120 percent increase compared to the first-quarter of 2010.         •   In the Permian Basin, oil and natural gas liquids production increased 17 percent over the first-quarter 2010. In aggregate, liquids production accounted for nearly 75 percent of the 44,000 equivalent barrels per day produced in the Permian Basin during the first quarter.         •   In Canada, we plan to commence steam injection at Jackfish 2 in May with first production expected by year-end. At full production, Jackfish 2 is expected to produce 35,000 barrels per day before royalties for more than 20 years.         •   Immediately adjacent to our Jackfish lease, we successfully completed the drilling of 135 appraisal wells on our Pike oil sands lease. The results were consistent with our expectations and will assist in determining the optimal development configuration. We anticipate filing a regulatory application for the first phase of Pike in the first half of 2012.         •   Net production from the Barnett Shale exceeded 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day in the first quarter, including 43,000 barrels per day of liquids. This was an 11 percent increase over the first quarter of 2010.         •   We brought six operated Granite Wash wells online in the first quarter. Initial production from these wells averaged 1,760 barrels of oil-equivalent per day, including 250 barrels of oil and 490 barrels of natural gas liquids per day. We have an average working interest of 84 percent in these wells.    22    Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Revenues                                      Three Months Ended March 31,         2011     2010     Change (1)       Oil Volumes (MMBbls)                           U.S. Onshore     3       3       +23 %   Canada     7       7       +1 %                           North America Onshore     10       10       +8 %   U.S. Offshore     —       1       -100 %                           Total     10       11       -4 %                           Gas Volumes (Bcf)                           U.S. Onshore     177       166       +7 %   Canada     51       50       +1 %                           North America Onshore     228       216       +5 %   U.S. Offshore     —       10       -100 %                           Total     228       226       +1 %                           NGLs Volumes (MMBbls)                           U.S. Onshore     8       7       +16 %   Canada     1       1       +1 %                           North America Onshore     9       8       +14 %   U.S. Offshore     —       —       -100 %                           Total     9       8       +12 %                           Total Volumes (MMBoe)                           U.S. Onshore     41       37       +10 %   Canada     16       16       +1 %                           North America Onshore     57       53       +7 %   U.S. Offshore     —       3       -100 %                           Total     57       56       +1 %                                        (1)   All percentage changes included in this table are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.

The decrease was primarily due to the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010, partially offset by an 8 percent increase in our North America Onshore production. The increased North America Onshore production resulted primarily from continued development of our Permian Basin properties and our Jackfish thermal heavy oil project in Canada.   Oil sales increased $34 million in the first three months of 2011 as a result of a 5 percent increase in our realized price without hedges. The largest contributor to the increase in our realized price was the increase in the average NYMEX West Texas Intermediate index price over the same time period. This was partially offset by an increase in our price differential based upon the NYMEX index. The larger differential resulted primarily from the widening of the heavy oil differentials related to our Canadian operations.  Gas Sales   A 1 percent increase in production during the first quarter of 2011 caused gas sales to increase by $7 million. The increase was comprised of the net effect of a 5 percent increase in our North America Onshore production, partially offset by the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010. The increased North America Onshore production resulted primarily from continued development activities in the Barnett and Cana-Woodford Shales, partially offset by natural declines in our other operating areas.   Gas sales decreased $269 million during the first three months of 2011 as a result of a 25 percent decrease in our realized price without hedges. This decrease was largely due to decreases in the North American regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based.  NGL Sales   NGL sales increased $32 million in the first quarter of 2011 due to a 12 percent increase in production. The increase in production was primarily due to increased drilling in North America Onshore areas that have liquids-rich gas.   NGL sales increased $11 million during the first three months of 2011 as a result of a 4 percent increase in our realized price without hedges. This increase was largely due to an increase in the Mont Belvieu, Texas index price over the same time period.  Oil, Gas and NGL Derivatives   The following tables provide financial information associated with our oil, gas and NGL hedges. The first table presents the cash settlements and unrealized gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues. The subsequent tables present our oil, gas and NGL prices with, and without, the effects of the cash settlements. The prices do not include the effects of unrealized gains and losses.  24    Table of Contents                              Three Months Ended March 31,         2011     2010         (In millions)       Cash settlement receipts (payments):                   Gas derivatives   $ 91     $ 96     Oil derivatives     (5 )     —                     Total cash settlements     86       96                     Unrealized (losses) gains on fair value changes:                   Gas derivatives     (57 )     520     Oil derivatives     (198 )     4     NGL derivatives     1       —                     Total unrealized (losses) gains on fair value changes     (254 )     524                     Oil, gas and NGL derivatives   $ (168 )   $ 620                                                                   Three Months Ended March 31, 2011         Oil     Gas     NGLs     Total         (Per Bbl)     (Per Mcf)     (Per Bbl)     (Per Boe)       Realized price without hedges   $ 70.95     $ 3.62     $ 37.39     $ 32.86     Cash settlements of hedges     (0.48 )     0.39       0.06       1.52                                 Realized price, including cash settlements   $ 70.47     $ 4.01     $ 37.45     $ 34.38                                                                               Three Months Ended March 31, 2010         Oil     Gas     NGLs     Total         (Per Bbl)     (Per Mcf)     (Per Bbl)     (Per Boe)       Realized price without hedges   $ 67.58     $ 4.80     $ 36.09     $ 37.07     Cash settlements of hedges     —       0.42       —       1.71                                 Realized price, including cash settlements   $ 67.58     $ 5.22     $ 36.09     $ 38.78                                    Our oil, gas and NGL derivatives include price swaps, costless collars and basis swaps. For the price swaps, we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty. The price collars set a floor and ceiling price. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, we cash-settle the difference with the counterparty to the collars. For the basis swaps, we receive a fixed differential between two regional gas index prices and pay a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. Cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments.   Additionally, to enhance a portion of our natural gas price swaps, we have sold gas call options for 2012 and oil call options for 2011 and 2012. The call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price.   During the first three months of 2011, we received $91 million, or $0.39 per Mcf, from counterparties to settle our gas derivatives and paid $5 million, or $0.48 per Bbl, to counterparties to settle our oil derivatives. During the first three months of 2010, we received $96 million, or $0.42 per Mcf, from counterparties to settle our gas derivatives.   In addition to recognizing these cash settlement effects, we also recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil, gas and NGL derivative instruments in each reporting period. We estimate the fair values of these derivatives primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations. We periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers.   The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices. We base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the Inside FERC Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments and the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil instruments. Based on the amount of volumes subject to our gas derivative financial instruments at March 31, 2011, a 10 percent increase in these forward curves would have increased our unrealized losses by approximately $163 million. A 10 percent increase in the forward curves associated with our oil derivatives would have increased our unrealized losses by approximately $302 million. Another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves, which we base primarily upon  25    Table of Contents  implied volatility. Finally, the amount of production subject to oil, gas and NGL derivatives is not a variable in our cash flow calculations, but it does impact the total derivative value.   Counterparty credit risk is also a component of commodity derivative valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with fourteen counterparties. Additionally, our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade. The mark-to-market exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted, decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to $50 million for the majority of our contracts. As of March 31, 2011, the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade.   Including the cash settlements discussed above, our oil, gas and NGL derivatives incurred a net loss of $168 million during the first three months of 2011 and generated a net gain of $620 million during the first three months of 2010. In addition to the impact of cash settlements, these net gains and losses were impacted by new positions and settlements that occurred during each period, as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves. A summary of our outstanding oil, gas and NGL derivative positions as of March 31, 2011 is included in Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of this report.  Marketing and Midstream Revenues and Operating Costs and Expenses                                      Three Months Ended March 31,         2011     2010     Change(1)         ($ in millions)               Marketing and midstream:                           Revenues   $ 455     $ 530       -14 %   Operating costs and expenses     333       397       -16 %                           Operating profit   $ 122     $ 133       -9 %                                        (1)   All percentage changes included in this table are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.    Marketing and midstream revenues decreased $75 million and operating costs and expenses decreased $64 million, causing operating profit to decrease $11 million. These decreases were primarily due to lower natural gas prices, partially offset by increased natural gas throughput.  Lease Operating Expenses (“LOE”)                                      Three Months Ended March 31,         2011     2010     Change(1)       Lease operating expenses ($ in millions):                           U.S. Onshore   $ 208     $ 191       +9 %   Canada     216       190       +13 %                           North America Onshore     424       381       +11 %   U.S. Offshore     —       33       -100 %                           Total   $ 424     $ 414       +2 %                                                       Lease operating expenses per Boe:                           U.S. Onshore   $ 5.11     $ 5.12       -0 %   Canada   $ 13.55     $ 12.09       +12 %   North America Onshore   $ 7.48     $ 7.19       +4 %   U.S. Offshore   $ —     $ 11.18       N/M     Total   $ 7.48     $ 7.41       +1 %                (1)   All percentage changes included in this table are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.    LOE increased $10 million in the first three months of 2011. This amount consisted of a $43 million increase related to our North America Onshore operations and a $33 million decrease related to our U.S. Offshore operations that were sold in the second quarter of 2010. Our 7 percent increase in North America Onshore production increased LOE by $27 million. Additionally, North America Onshore LOE increased $12 million due to changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. The higher exchange rate was also the main contributor to the increases in North America Onshore and total LOE per Boe.  26    Table of Contents  Taxes Other Than Income Taxes                                      Three Months Ended March 31,         2011     2010     Change(1)         ($ in millions)               Production   $ 56     $ 59       -5 %   Ad valorem     50       40       +26 %   Other     2       2       +34 %                           Total   $ 108     $ 101       +8 %                                        (1)   All percentage changes included in this table are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.    Production taxes decreased $3 million due to a slight decrease in our U.S. Onshore revenues. Ad valorem taxes increased $10 million due to higher estimated assessed values of our oil and gas property and equipment.  Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization of Oil and Gas Properties (“DD&A”)                                      Three Months Ended March 31,         2011     2010     Change(1)       Total production volumes (MMBoe)     57       56       +1 %   DD&A rate ($ per Boe)   $ 7.80     $ 7.63       +2 %                           DD&A expense ($ in millions)   $ 442     $ 426       +4 %                                        (1)   All percentage changes included in this table are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.    The following table details the changes in DD&A of oil and gas properties between the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010 (in millions).                     2010 DD&A   $ 426     Change due to rate     10     Change due to volumes     6               2011 DD&A   $ 442                  Oil and gas property-related DD&A increased $10 million during the first three months of 2011 due to a 2 percent increase in the DD&A rate. The largest contributors to the higher rate were our drilling and development activities subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2010 and changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. These increases were largely offset by a decrease in the rate due to our 2010 U.S. offshore property divestitures.  General and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)                                      Three Months Ended March 31,         2011     2010     Change(1)         ($ in millions)               Gross G&A   $ 238     $ 245       -3 %   Capitalized G&A     (81 )     (80 )     +1 %   Reimbursed G&A     (27 )     (27 )     0 %                           Net G&A   $ 130     $ 138       -6 %                                        (1)   All percentage changes included in this table are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.    Gross and net G&A decreased primarily due to lower employee compensation and benefits resulting from our 2010 offshore divestitures.  27    Table of Contents  Interest Expense                              Three Months Ended March 31,         2011     2010         (In millions)       Interest based on debt outstanding   $ 98     $ 105     Capitalized interest     (20 )     (21 )   Other     3       2                     Total interest expense   $ 81     $ 86                        Interest based on debt outstanding decreased primarily due to the early redemption of our 7.25 percent $350 million senior notes in the second quarter of 2010.  Interest-Rate and Other Financial Instruments                              Three Months Ended March 31,         2011     2010         (In millions)       (Gains) losses from interest rate swaps:                   Cash settlements   $ (16 )   $ (16 )   Unrealized fair value changes     (1 )     1                     Total   $ (17 )   $ (15 )                      During the first three months of 2011 and 2010, we received cash settlements totaling $16 million from counterparties to settle our interest rate swaps.   In addition to recognizing cash settlements, we recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps each reporting period. We estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yields. We periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers. In the first three months of 2011, we recorded an unrealized gain of $1 million as a result of changes in interest rates. In the first three months of 2010, we recorded an unrealized loss of $1 million as a result of changes in interest rates.   The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future interest rate yields. We base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds Rate provided by a third party. Based on the notional amount subject to the interest rate swaps at March 31, 2011, a 10% increase in these forward curves would have increased our unrealized gain for our interest rate swaps by approximately $69 million.   Similar to our commodity derivative contracts, counterparty credit risk is also a component of interest rate derivative valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with seven separate counterparties. Additionally, our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade. The mark-to-market exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted, decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to $50 million for the majority of our contracts. The credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade as of March 31, 2011.  28    Table of Contents  Income Taxes   The following table presents our total income tax expense and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the U.S. statutory income tax rate.

Changes in operating cash flow are largely due to the same factors that affect our net earnings, with the exception of those earnings changes due to noncash expenses such as DD&A, property impairments, financial instrument fair value changes and deferred income taxes. As a result, our operating cash flow decreased approximately 6 percent during 2011 primarily due to the decrease in revenues as discussed in the “Results of Operations” section of this report.   During the first three months of 2011, our operating cash flow funded approximately 70 percent of our cash payments for capital expenditures. Commercial paper borrowings were used to fund the remainder of our cash-based capital expenditures. During the first three months of 2010, our operating cash flow was sufficient to fund our cash payments for capital expenditures.  Other Sources of Cash — Continuing and Discontinued Operations   As needed, we supplement our operating cash flow and available cash by accessing available credit under our credit facilities and commercial paper program. We may also issue long-term debt to supplement our operating cash flow while maintaining adequate liquidity under our credit facilities. Additionally, we may acquire short-term investments to maximize our income on available cash balances. As needed, we reduce such short-term investment balances to further supplement our operating cash flow and available cash. Another source of cash proceeds comes from employee stock option exercises.   During the first three months of 2011, we utilized commercial paper borrowings of $1.2 billion to fund capital expenditures, common share repurchases and dividends in excess of our operating cash flow.  30    Table of Contents   During the first three months of 2011, we received proceeds of $88 million from shares issued for employee stock option exercises.   During the first three months of 2010, we sold our interests in the Jack, St. Malo and Cascade Lower Tertiary projects in the Gulf of Mexico for $1.3 billion and used the proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings.  Capital Expenditures   Our capital expenditures are presented by geographic area and type in the following table. The amounts in the table reflect cash payments for capital expenditures, including cash paid for capital expenditures incurred in prior quarters. Capital expenditures actually incurred during the first three months of 2011 and 2010 were approximately $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.

The vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling and development of oil and gas properties, which totaled $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion in the first three months of 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in exploration and development capital spending in the first three months of 2011 was primarily due to increased drilling activities. With rising oil prices and proceeds from our 2010 offshore divestitures, we are increasing drilling primarily to grow our liquids production.   Capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants, natural gas pipeline systems and oil pipelines. Our midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by oil and gas drilling activities. Therefore, the increase in development drilling also increased midstream capital activities.   Capital expenditures related to corporate activities increased in 2011. This increase is largely driven by the construction of our new headquarters in Oklahoma City.  Short-term Investments   During the first three months of 2011, we purchased $1.6 billion of United States Treasury bills that have original maturities greater than three months and are, therefore, considered short-term investments. As of March 31, 2011, the average maturity of these short-term investments was 121 days.  Repurchases of Common Stock   During the first three months of 2011, we continued repurchasing shares under our $3.5 billion stock repurchase program announced in May 2010. Including unsettled shares, we repurchased 8.1 million common shares for $696 million, or $85.95 per share, in the first quarter of 2011. This program expires on December 31, 2011.  Dividends   Our common stock dividends were $68 million and $72 million (quarterly rates of $0.16 per share) in the first three months of 2011 and 2010, respectively.   In March 2011, we announced an increase of our quarterly cash dividend to $0.17 per share that will begin in the second quarter of 2011.  31    Table of Contents  Liquidity   Historically, our primary source of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow. Additionally, we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow. Other available sources of capital and liquidity include equity and debt securities that can be issued pursuant to our automatically effective shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. Another significant source of future liquidity will be proceeds from the sales of our remaining offshore assets in Brazil and Angola. We estimate the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures, share repurchases, debt repayments and other contractual commitments. The following sections discuss changes to our liquidity subsequent to filing our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Operating Cash Flow   We expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity. Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil, gas and NGLs produced. To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we have utilized various price swap, fixed-price physical delivery and price collar contracts to set minimum and maximum prices on our 2011 production. As of March 31, 2011, approximately 34 percent of our 2011 gas production is associated with financial price swaps, collars and fixed-price physicals. We also have basis swaps associated with 0.2 Bcf per day of our 2011 gas production. Additionally, approximately 36 percent of our 2011 oil production is associated with financial price collars. We also have call options that, if exercised, would relate to an additional 16 percent of our 2011 oil production.   Looking beyond 2011, we have also entered into contracts to manage the price risk relative to our 2012 and 2013 oil, gas and NGL production. A summary of these contracts as of March 31, 2011, is included in Item 3. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of this report.  Credit Availability   In March 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our commercial paper program from $2.2 billion to $5.0 billion.   As of April 25, 2011, we had $2.7 billion of available capacity under our syndicated, unsecured Senior Credit Facility and $1.3 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.   The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, of no more than 65 percent. The credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures, bonds, notes payable, credit facility borrowings and short-term commercial paper borrowings. In addition, total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil, gas and NGL production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment. Funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables. The credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns, such as full cost ceiling impairments. As of March 31, 2011, we were in compliance with this covenant. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2011, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 17.7 percent.   Although we ended the first quarter of 2011 with $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, the vast majority of this amount consists of proceeds from our International offshore divestitures. Based on our evaluation of future cash needs across our operations in the United States and Canada, these proceeds remain outside of the United States. With these proceeds remaining outside of the United States, we expect to continue to increase our commercial paper borrowings in the United States to supplement our United States based operating cash flow to fund our capital expenditure and common stock repurchase programs.  Common Stock Repurchase Program   As of April 25, 2011, we had repurchased $2.1 billion, or 28.3 million common shares at an average price of $72.98 under our $3.5 billion repurchase program. This program expires on December 31, 2011.  32    Table of Contents  Pension Funding and Estimates   We previously disclosed that we expected to contribute approximately $84 million to our qualified pension plans during 2011. We now expect to contribute $346 million to our qualified pension plans in 2011, including $32 million that was contributed in the first quarter.     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Commodity Price Risk   We have commodity derivatives that pertain to production for the last nine months of 2011, as well as 2012 and 2013. The key terms to all our oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments as of March 31, 2011 are presented in the following tables.   We had the following open oil derivative positions:                                                                  Production               Period   Price Swaps     Price Collars     Call Options Sold                 Weighted             Weighted     Weighted             Weighted         Volume     Average Price     Volume     Average Floor Price     Average Ceiling Price     Volume     Average Price     Period   (Bbls/d)     ($/Bbl)     (Bbls/d)     ($/Bbl)     ($/Bbl)     (Bbls/d)     ($/Bbl)     Q2-Q4 2011     —       —       45,000     $ 75.00     $ 108.89       19,500     $ 95.00     Q1-Q4 2012      9,000     $ 104.20       35,000     $ 82.14     $ 126.42       19,500     $ 95.00        We had the following open natural gas derivative positions:                                                                  Production                     Period   Price Swaps     Price Collars     Call Options Sold                 Weighted             Weighted     Weighted             Weighted         Volume     Average Price     Volume     Average Floor Price     Average Ceiling Price     Volume     Average Price     Period   (MMBtu/d)     ($/MMBtu)     (MMBtu/d)     ($/MMBtu)     ($/MMBtu)     (MMBtu/d)     ($/MMBtu)       Q2 2011     912,500     $ 5.24       350,000     $ 4.18     $ 4.68       —       —     Q3 2011     712,500     $ 5.51       —       —       —       —       —     Q4 2011     712,500     $ 5.51       —       —       —       —       —     Q1-Q4 2012     130,000     $ 5.06       —       —       —       487,500     $ 6.00                                       Basis Swaps                         Weighted Average                         Differential to                 Volume     Henry Hub     Production Period   Index   (MMBtu/d)     ($/MMBtu)       Q2-Q4 2011   Panhandle Eastern Pipeline     150,000     $ 0.33       33    Table of Contents   We had the following open NGL derivative positions:                                  Basis Swaps                         Weighted Average                 Volume     Differential to WTI     Production Period   Pay     (Bbls/d)     ($/Bbl)       Q2-Q4 2011   Natural Gasoline     500     $ 9.75     Q1-Q4 2012   Natural Gasoline     500     $ 10.10     Q1-Q4 2013   Natural Gasoline     500     $ 6.80        The fair values of our commodity derivatives presented in the tables above are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices. At March 31, 2011, a 10 percent increase in the forward curves associated with our gas derivative instruments would have increased our unrealized losses by approximately $163 million. A 10 percent increase in the forward curves associated with our oil derivative instruments would have increased our unrealized losses by approximately $302 million.  Interest Rate Risk   At March 31, 2011, we had debt outstanding of $6.8 billion. Of this amount, $5.6 billion, or 82 percent bears fixed interest rates averaging 7.1 percent. Additionally, we had $1.2 billion of outstanding commercial paper, bearing interest at floating rates which averaged 0.30 percent.   As of March 31, 2011, our interest rate swaps consisted of instruments with a total notional amount of $2.1 billion. These consist of instruments with a notional amount of $1.15 billion in which we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate. The remaining instruments consist of forward starting swaps. Under the terms of the forward starting swaps, we will net settle these contracts in September 2011, or sooner should we elect. The net settlement amount will be based upon us paying a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.92 percent and receiving a floating rate that is based upon the three-month LIBOR. The difference between the fixed and floating rate will be applied to the notional amount for the 30-year period from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2041. The key terms of these contracts are presented in the following tables.

At March 31, 2011, a 10 percent increase in these forward curves would have increased our unrealized gain for our interest rate swaps by approximately $69 million.  Foreign Currency Risk   Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues, expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period. A 10 percent unfavorable change in the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our March 31, 2011 balance sheet.  34    Table of Contents     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Devon, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.   Based on their evaluation, Devon’s principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that Devon’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of March 31, 2011, to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in Devon’s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Devon’s internal control over financial reporting.
