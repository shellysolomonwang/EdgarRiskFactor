CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Unaudited)   1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes of Devon Energy Corporation (“Devon”) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Pursuant to such rules and regulations, certain disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted. The accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Devon’s 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements furnished in this report reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of Devon’s financial position as of September 30, 2011 and Devon’s results of operations and cash flows for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted   In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. This update does not require additional fair value measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. However, beginning in Devon’s 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, this update will require certain additional disclosures related to Devon’s fair value measurements. Devon does not expect the adoption of this update will materially impact its financial statement disclosures.   In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income. Beginning in Devon’s 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, this update will give Devon the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Devon has not determined which presentation option it will choose but does not expect its selection to materially impact the presentation of its financial statements.   In September 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-08: Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. This update permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Devon will adopt the provisions for this update in its annual impairment test as of October 31, 2011. Devon does not expect the adoption of this update will impact its goodwill value.   2. Short-Term Investments    Devon periodically invests excess cash in U.S. Treasuries, commercial paper and other marketable securities with original maturities exceeding three months. Such securities are presented as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.   During the first nine months of 2011, Devon invested a portion of the International offshore divestiture proceeds it had received, causing short-term investments to increase. The carrying value of these investments approximates their fair value. As of September 30, 2011, the average remaining maturity of our short-term investments was 97 days, with a weighted average yield of 0.2 percent.  10    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)    (Unaudited)   3.

Derivative Financial Instruments   Objectives and Strategies   Devon periodically enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to market risks, such as changes in commodity prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates. Devon does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes and has elected not to designate any of its derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment.   Devon’s commodity derivative financial instruments include financial price swaps, basis swaps, costless price collars and call options. Under the terms of the price swaps, Devon receives a fixed price for its production and pays a variable market price to the contract counterparty. For the basis swaps, Devon receives a fixed differential between two regional gas index prices and pays a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. The price collars set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon will cash-settle the difference with the counterparty to the collars. Under the terms of the call options, Devon sold to counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price.   Devon’s interest rate swaps include contracts in which Devon receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate on a total notional amount.   Devon’s foreign currency contracts include forward contracts that hedge certain monetary assets denominated in Canadian dollars.  Credit Risk   Through its derivative financial instruments, Devon exposes itself to credit risk, which arises from the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are placed with a number of counterparties whom Devon believes are minimal credit risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative contracts only with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers. Additionally, Devon’s derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either its or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade. The mark-to-market exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted, decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to $55 million for the majority of Devon’s contracts. As of September 30, 2011, the credit ratings of all Devon’s counterparties were investment grade.  11    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)    (Unaudited)  Commodity Derivatives   As of September 30, 2011, Devon had the following open oil derivative positions.

Other Current Assets    The components of other current assets include the following:                              September 30, 2011     December 31, 2010         (In millions)       Derivative financial instruments   $ 701     $ 348     Income taxes receivable     420       270     Inventories     98       120     Other     83       41                     Other current assets   $ 1,302     $ 779                        6. Goodwill    During the first nine months of 2011, Devon’s Canadian goodwill decreased $129 million entirely due to foreign currency translation.   7. Debt   Credit Lines   Devon has a $2.7 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Senior Credit Facility”). As of September 30, 2011, Devon had no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, but its borrowing capacity was reduced $0.1 billion by outstanding letters of credit.   The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devon’s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization to be less than 65 percent. The credit agreement contains definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Also, total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling impairments or goodwill impairments. As of September 30, 2011, Devon was in compliance with this covenant. Devon’s debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2011, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 22 percent.  2.40% Notes Due July 15, 2016, 4.00% Notes Due July 15, 2021 and 5.60% Notes Due July 15, 2041   In July 2011, Devon issued $2.25 billion of senior notes. The $2.22 billion of net proceeds received after discounts and issuance costs, were used to repay outstanding commercial paper balances as of June 30, 2011. These notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Devon.  Commercial Paper   In March 2011, Devon’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in its commercial paper program from $2.2 billion to $5.0 billion. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between 1 and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing. The interest rate is based on a standard index such as the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR, or the money market rate as found on the commercial paper market.   Although Devon ended the third quarter of 2011 with approximately $6.8 billion of cash and short-term investments, the vast majority of this amount consists of proceeds from its International divestitures. Based on Devon’s evaluation of future cash needs across its operations in the United States and Canada, these proceeds remain outside of the United States.   Consequently, subsequent to the commercial paper repayment in July 2011 noted above, Devon utilized additional commercial paper borrowings primarily to fund debt maturities, capital expenditures, common stock repurchases and dividends in excess of cash flow generated by its United States operating activities. As of September 30, 2011, Devon’s average borrowing rate on its $3.2 billion of commercial paper borrowings was 0.27 percent. At December 31, 2010, Devon had no borrowings of commercial paper.  14    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)   (Unaudited)   8. Asset Retirement Obligations    The schedule below summarizes changes in Devon’s asset retirement obligations.                              Nine Months         Ended September 30,         2011     2010         (In millions)       Asset retirement obligations as of beginning of period   $ 1,497     $ 1,513     Liabilities incurred     38       36     Liabilities settled     (56 )     (94 )   Revision of estimated obligation     19       194     Liabilities assumed by others     —       (256 )   Accretion expense on discounted obligation     69       71     Foreign currency translation     (41 )     10                     Asset retirement obligations as of end of period     1,526       1,474     Less current portion     66       80                     Asset retirement obligations, long-term   $ 1,460     $ 1,394                        During the first nine months of 2010, Devon recognized a revision to its asset retirement obligations totaling $194 million. The increase was primarily due to an overall increase in abandonment cost estimates and a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the obligations.   During the first nine months of 2010, Devon reduced its asset retirement obligations by $256 million for those obligations that were assumed by purchasers of Devon’s Gulf of Mexico oil and gas properties in 2010.   9.

During 2011, Devon increased its estimated contribution to $446 million and has fully funded the contribution as of September 30, 2011. The increase in Devon’s 2011 contributions is due to increased discretionary funding.   As a result of the discretionary contributions noted above, Devon amended its target allocation for its pension plan assets in the second quarter of 2011. Devon previously disclosed a target allocation of 47.5% for equity securities, 40% for fixed  15    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)   (Unaudited)  income and 12.5% for other investment types. Devon now expects an allocation of 70% fixed income, 20% equity and 10% for other investment types for its pension assets.   10. Stockholders’ Equity   Stock Repurchases   During the first nine months of 2011, Devon repurchased 26.0 million common shares for $2.0 billion, or $76.95 per share, under its $3.5 billion stock repurchase program announced in 2010. As of September 30, 2011, Devon had repurchased 44.3 million common shares for $3.2 billion, or $72.25 per share, under this program, which expires December 31, 2011.  Dividends   Devon paid common stock dividends of $209 million and $211 million in the first nine months of 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts reflect quarterly cash dividend rates of $0.16 per share in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 and $0.17 per share in the second and third quarters of 2011.   11. Commitments and Contingencies    Devon is party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management to involve future amounts that would be material to Devon’s financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals although actual amounts could differ materially from management’s estimate.  Royalty Matters   Numerous natural gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging violation of the federal False Claims Act. The suits allege that the producers and related parties used below-market prices, improper deductions, improper measurement techniques and transactions with affiliates, which resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with natural gas and NGLs produced and sold from federal and Indian owned or controlled lands. Devon does not currently believe that it is subject to material exposure with respect to such royalty matters.  Environmental Matters   Devon is subject to certain laws and regulations relating to environmental remediation activities associated with past operations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar state statutes. In response to liabilities associated with these activities, loss accruals primarily consist of estimated costs associated with remediation. Devon’s monetary exposure for environmental matters is not expected to be material.  Chief Redemption Matters   In 2006, Devon acquired Chief Holdings LLC (“Chief”) from the owners of Chief, including Trevor Rees-Jones, the majority owner of Chief. In 2008, a former owner of Chief filed a petition against Rees-Jones, as the former majority owner of Chief, and Devon, as Chief’s successor pursuant to the 2006 acquisition. The petition claimed, among other things, violations of the Texas Securities Act, fraud and breaches of Rees-Jones’ fiduciary responsibility to the former owner in connection with Chief’s 2004 redemption of the owner’s minority ownership stake in Chief.   On June 20, 2011, a court issued a judgment against Rees-Jones for $196 million, of which $133 million of the judgment was also issued against Devon. Both Rees-Jones and Devon are appealing the judgment. However, if the appeal is unsuccessful, Devon can and will seek full payment of the judgment and any related interest, costs and expenses from Rees-Jones pursuant to an existing indemnification agreement between Rees-Jones, certain other parties and Devon. Devon does not expect to have any net exposure as a result of the judgment. However, because Devon does not have a legal right of set  16    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)   (Unaudited)  off with respect to the judgment, Devon has recorded in its September 30, 2011 consolidated balance sheet both a $133 million liability relating to the judgment with an offsetting $133 million receivable relating to its right to be indemnified by Rees-Jones and certain other parties pursuant to the indemnification agreement.  Other Matters   Devon is involved in other various routine legal proceedings incidental to its business. However, to Devon’s knowledge, there were no other material pending legal proceedings to which Devon is a party or to which any of its property is subject.  Commitments   At the end of 2010, Devon’s commitments included approximately $0.6 billion related to lease contracts for a deepwater drilling rig and a floating, production, storage and offloading facility being used in Brazil. Devon’s remaining commitments for these leases were assumed by the buyer of its assets upon closing the Brazil divestiture transaction discussed in Note 15.   12. Fair Value Measurements    Certain of Devon’s assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Such assets and liabilities include amounts for both financial and non-financial instruments. The following tables provide carrying value and fair value measurement information for Devon’s financial assets and liabilities.   The carrying values of cash, accounts receivable, other current receivables, accounts payable and other payables and accrued expenses included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets approximated fair value at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. These assets and liabilities are not presented in the following tables.

The fair value approximates the carrying value.  Level 2 Fair Value Measurements   Cash equivalents and short-term investments — Amounts consist primarily of commercial paper investments. The fair value is based upon quotes from brokers, which generally approximate the carrying value.   Debt — Devon’s debt instruments do not actively trade in an established market. The fair values of its fixed-rate debt are estimated by discounting the principal and interest payments at rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity. The fair value of Devon’s variable-rate commercial paper borrowings is the carrying value.  Level 3 Fair Value Measurements   Devon’s Level 3 fair value measurements included in the table above relate to certain long-term investments and a non-interest bearing promissory note.

Restructuring Costs    In the fourth quarter of 2009, Devon announced plans to divest its offshore assets. As of September 30, 2011, Devon had divested all of its U.S. Offshore assets and substantially all of its International assets.   Through the end of the third quarter of 2011, Devon had incurred $202 million of restructuring costs associated with these divestitures. This amount is comprised of $120 million of employee severance costs, $78 million associated with abandoned office leases and $4 million of other miscellaneous costs.  18    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)   (Unaudited)  Financial Statement Presentation   The schedule below summarizes activity and balances associated with Devon’s restructuring liabilities.

Income Taxes    In the second quarter of 2011, a portion of Devon’s foreign earnings were no longer deemed to be permanently reinvested in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, Devon recognized $725 million of deferred tax expense and $19 million of current income tax expense during the second quarter of 2011 related to assumed repatriations of such earnings under current U.S. tax law. These earnings were primarily related to the gains generated from Devon’s International divestiture transactions. Excluding the $744 million of tax expense, Devon’s effective income tax rate was 33% in the first nine months of 2011.  19    Table of Contents   DEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)   (Unaudited)   Also, in the second and third quarters of 2010, Devon recognized $52 million and $23 million, respectively, of deferred income tax expense related to assumed repatriations of earnings in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Excluding these amounts, Devon’s effective income tax rate was 34% in the first nine months ended of 2010.   15. Discontinued Operations    In May 2011, Devon completed the divestiture of its operations in Brazil. With the close of the Brazil transaction, Devon has substantially completed its planned offshore divestitures. In aggregate, Devon’s U.S. and International offshore sales have generated total proceeds of $10 billion, or approximately $8 billion after-tax, assuming repatriation of a substantial portion of the foreign proceeds under current U.S. tax law.   Revenues related to Devon’s discontinued operations totaled $43 million in the first nine months of 2011 and $139 million and $573 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively. Devon did not have revenues related to its discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2011.   Earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 and 2010 were largely impacted by gains on Devon’s International divestiture transactions. The following table presents the gains on the divestitures according to the quarters in which the divestitures closed in 2011 and 2010.

Segment Information    Devon manages its North American onshore operations through distinct operating segments, or divisions, which are defined primarily by geographic areas. For financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its United States divisions into one reporting segment due to the similar nature of the businesses. However, Devon’s Canadian and International divisions are reported as separate reporting segments primarily due to significant differences in the respective regulatory environments.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     The following discussion and analysis addresses material changes in our results of operations and capital resources and uses for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, compared to the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, and in our financial condition and liquidity since December 31, 2010. For information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates, see our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  Financial Overview   During the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, we generated net earnings of $1.0 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, and $4.2 billion, or $9.93 per diluted share, for the respective periods. This compares to net earnings of $2.1 billion, or $4.79 per diluted share, and $4.0 billion, or $8.99 per diluted share, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively.   These earnings comparisons are affected by gains associated with divestitures of our International operations. Our financial results for the first nine months of 2011 includes an after-tax gain of $1.8 billion related to International divestitures. Our financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 include after-tax gains of $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, related to International divestitures.   Key financial measures of our operating performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 compared to 2010 are summarized below. Our North America Onshore comparisons exclude amounts related to our Gulf of Mexico assets that were divested in the first half of 2010.       •   North America Onshore oil and NGLs production increased 17% to 20 MMBbls and 13% to 59 MMBbls in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively.        •   North America Onshore gas production increased 3% to 240 Bcf and 4% to 708 Bcf in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively.        •   The combined realized price without hedges for oil, gas and NGLs increased 16% to $34.72 per Boe and 7% to $34.78 per Boe in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively.        •   Oil, gas and NGL derivatives generated cash receipts of $96 million and $241 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively, and cash receipts of $232 million and $580 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively.        •   Marketing and midstream operating profit increased 11% to $138 million and 7% to $408 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively.        •   North America Onshore per unit operating costs increased 6% to $7.81 per Boe and 4% to $7.62 per Boe in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively.        •   Operating cash flow increased 4% to $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2011 and was flat at $4.2 billion in the first nine months of 2011.        •   Capital spending totaled $5.5 billion in the first nine months of 2011.     In the second quarter of 2011, we completed the divestiture of our operations in Brazil. With the close of the Brazil transaction, we have substantially completed our planned offshore divestitures, generating aggregate after-tax proceeds of approximately $8 billion, assuming repatriation of a substantial portion of the foreign proceeds under current U.S. tax law.   As of September 30, 2011, we held approximately $6.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. We also have access to short-term commercial paper borrowings and our $2.7 billion credit facility. With this liquidity, we continue executing our exploration and development programs, with a focus on near-term growth of our liquids production, and repurchasing common shares under our $3.5 billion share repurchase program. Through October 21, 2011, we had repurchased 47.6 million shares for $3.4 billion, or $71.32 per share.  27    Table of Contents  Third-Quarter Operating Highlights       •   In the Permian Basin, we increased oil and natural gas liquids production 17 percent compared to the third quarter of 2010. Liquids production accounted for 75 percent of the 50,000 Boe/d produced in the third quarter of 2011.        •   At the Bone Spring play in the Permian Basin, we added 11 new wells to production in the third quarter of 2011. Initial daily production from the 11 wells averaged 540 Boe/d per well.        •   In Canada, average net production from our 100 percent-owned Jackfish 1 and Jackfish 2 projects reached a record 36,000 Bbls/d during the quarter. Net production from our Jackfish 2 oil sands project continued to ramp-up ahead of schedule.        •   Also in Canada, we completed more than 19 exploration wells targeting oil and liquids rich opportunities across our more than 4 million net acres in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. We tied in 10 of these wells to production in the third quarter. This activity was highlighted by results in the Ferrier area where we commenced production on three Cardium wells with initial production averaging 770 Boe/d per well.        •   Third-quarter production from the Cana-Woodford Shale increased 71 percent compared to the year-ago quarter. Net production averaged a record 0.2 Bcfe/d in the quarter, including 8,100 Bbls/d of liquids. Our Cana-Woodford gas processing facility remains on schedule to be fully operational in the fourth quarter.        •   Our Barnett Shale production totaled 1.3 Bcfe/d, an eight percent increase over the third-quarter 2010. Liquids production in the Barnett Shale averaged 46,000 Bbls/d, a 15 percent year-over-year increase.        •   We brought ten operated Granite Wash wells online in the third quarter. Initial production from these wells averaged 1,250 Boe/d, including 180 Bbls/d of oil and 405 Bbls/d of natural gas liquids. We have an average working interest of 86 percent in these wells.

The increased production in both periods was driven by the continued development of our Permian Basin properties and our Jackfish thermal heavy oil projects in Canada. The production increase in the nine months ended 2011 was partially offset by the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010.  29    Table of Contents   Oil sales increased $99 million and $354 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively, as a result of a 14 percent and 17 percent increase in our realized price without hedges. The largest contributor to the higher realized prices was the increase in the average West Texas Intermediate price over the same time periods.  Gas Sales   Gas sales increased $29 million and $48 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively, due to increased production. The increased production in both periods resulted primarily from continued development activities in the Barnett and Cana-Woodford Shales, partially offset by natural declines in our other operating areas. The production increase in the nine months ended 2011 was partially offset by the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010.   Gas sales increased $22 million and decreased $207 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively, as a result of a 2 percent increase and a 7 percent decrease in our realized price without hedges. The changes in price were largely due to fluctuations of the North American regional index prices upon which our gas sales are based.  NGL Sales   NGL sales increased $31 million and $101 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively, due to increased production. The increased production in both periods was primarily due to increased drilling in our Barnett Shale, Cana-Woodford Shale and Granite Wash locations.   NGL sales increased $123 million and $238 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively, due to a 46 percent and 28 percent increase in our realized price without hedges. The higher prices were largely due to increases in the Mont Belvieu, Texas hub price during the same time periods.  Oil, Gas and NGL Derivatives   The following tables provide financial information associated with our oil, gas and NGL hedges. The first table presents the cash settlements and unrealized gains and losses recognized as components of our revenues. The subsequent tables present our oil, gas and NGL prices with, and without, the effects of the cash settlements. The prices do not include the effects of unrealized gains and losses.

For the price swaps, we receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty. The price collars set a floor and ceiling price. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, we cash-settle the difference with the counterparty to the collars. For the basis swaps, we receive a fixed differential between two regional gas index prices and pay a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. Cash settlements as presented in the tables above represent realized gains or losses related to these various instruments.   Additionally, to enhance a portion of our natural gas price swaps, we have sold gas call options for 2012 and oil call options for 2011 and 2012. The call options give counterparties the right to purchase production at a predetermined price.   During the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, we received $97 million, or $0.40 per Mcf, and $262 million, or $0.37 per Mcf, respectively, from counterparties to settle our gas derivatives and paid $2 million, or $0.13 per Bbl, and $23 million, or $0.70 per Bbl, respectively, from counterparties to settle our oil derivatives. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, we received $232 million, or $1.00 per Mcf, and $580 million, or $0.83 per Mcf, respectively, from counterparties to settle our gas derivatives.   In addition to recognizing cash settlement effects, we recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our oil, gas and NGL derivative instruments in each reporting period. We estimate the fair values of these derivatives primarily by using internal discounted cash flow calculations. We periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers.   The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of future commodity prices. We base our estimate of future prices upon published forward commodity price curves such as the Inside FERC Henry Hub forward curve for gas instruments and the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate forward curve for oil instruments. Another key input to our cash flow calculations is our estimate of volatility for these forward curves, which we base primarily upon implied volatility. Finally, the amount of production subject to oil, gas and NGL derivatives is not a variable in our cash flow calculations, but it does impact the total derivative value.   Counterparty credit risk is also a component of commodity derivative valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with fourteen counterparties. Additionally, our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade. The mark-to-market exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted, decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to $55 million for the majority of our contracts. As of September 30, 2011, the credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade.  31    Table of Contents   Including the cash settlements discussed above, our oil, gas and NGL derivatives generated net gains of $738 million and $986 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, respectively, and net gains of $209 million and $874 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, respectively. In addition to the impact of cash settlements, these net gains and losses were also impacted by new positions that occurred during each period, as well as the relationships between contract prices and the associated forward curves. A summary of our outstanding oil, gas and NGL derivative positions as of September 30, 2011 is included in Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements.

During the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, marketing and midstream operating profit increased $13 million and $25 million, respectively. The increases in each period were primarily due to higher NGL prices and higher natural gas throughput and NGL production.

LOE increased $60 million in the third quarter of 2011. The largest contributor to this increase was our 8 percent growth in North America Onshore production, which caused an increase of $32 million. Additionally, LOE increased $14 million due to changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. The remainder of the increase is primarily due to cost escalation. The higher exchange rate and cost escalation were also the primary contributors to the increases in LOE per Boe.   LOE increased $81 million in the first nine months of 2011. This amount consisted of a $141 million increase related to our North America Onshore operations and a $60 million decrease related to our U.S. Offshore operations that were sold in the second quarter of 2010. The largest contributor to our North America Onshore LOE increase was our 7 percent growth in production, which caused an increase of $86 million. Additionally, North America Onshore LOE increased $38 million due to changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. The higher exchange rate and cost escalation were also the main contributors to the increase in North America Onshore LOE per Boe.  32    Table of Contents  Taxes Other Than Income Taxes                                                              Three Months Ended September 30,     Nine Months Ended September 30,         2011     2010     Change(1)     2011     2010     Change(1)         ($ in millions)       Production   $ 63     $ 51       +23 %   $ 187     $ 156       +20 %   Ad valorem     43       42       +4 %     144       128       +13 %   Other     2       2       -18 %     5       4       +26 %                                               Total   $ 108     $ 95       +14 %   $ 336     $ 288       +17 %                                                            (1)   All percentage changes included in this table are based on actual figures rather than the rounded figures presented.    Production taxes increased in the third quarter of 2011 and first nine months of 2011 primarily due to an increase in our U.S. Onshore revenues, on which such taxes are assessed. Ad valorem taxes increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 primarily due to higher estimated assessed values of our oil and gas property and equipment.

The largest contributors to the higher rates were our drilling and development activities subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2010 and changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian dollars. The increase in the nine months ended 2011 rate was partially offset by the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore properties in the second quarter of 2010.

Gross and net G&A increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits.  33    Table of Contents  Restructuring Costs                                              Three Months     Nine Months         Ended September 30,     Ended September 30,         2011     2010     2011     2010         (In millions)       Lease obligations   $ (3 )   $ 70     $ (5 )   $ 70     Asset impairments     —       11       2       11     Cash severance     —       (13 )     1       (18 )   Share-based awards     —       (5 )     (1 )     (9 )   Other     —       —       1       1                                 Total   $ (3 )   $ 63     $ (2 )   $ 55                                    As a result of our offshore divestitures, we ceased using certain office space in the third quarter of 2010 that was subject to non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. Consequently, we recognized $70 million of restructuring costs that represent the present value of our future obligations under the leases, net of anticipated sublease income. Our estimate of lease obligations was based upon certain key estimates that could change over the term of the leases. These estimates include the estimated sublease income that we may receive over the term of the leases, as well as the amount of variable operating costs that we will be required to pay under the leases. Additionally, we recognized $11 million of asset impairment charges for leasehold improvements and furniture associated with the office space we ceased using in the third quarter of 2010.  Interest Expense                                              Three Months     Nine Months         Ended September 30,     Ended September 30,         2011     2010     2011     2010         (In millions)       Interest based on debt outstanding   $ 120     $ 98     $ 318     $ 307     Capitalized interest     (19 )     (20 )     (56 )     (55 )   Early retirement of debt     —       —       —       19     Other     3       5       8       9                                 Total interest expense   $ 104     $ 83     $ 270     $ 280                                    Interest based on debt outstanding increased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2011 primarily due to the issuance of our $2.25 billion notes in July 2011.   In the second quarter of 2010, we redeemed $350 million of 7.25% senior notes prior to their scheduled maturity of October 1, 2011. The $19 million presented in the table above represents the net of the $28 million make-whole premium and $9 million amortization of the remaining premium.  Interest-Rate and Other Financial Instruments                                              Three Months     Nine Months         Ended September 30,     Ended September 30,         2011     2010     2011     2010         (In millions)       (Gains) losses from:                                   Interest rate swaps — cash settlements   $ (52 )   $ (17 )   $ (73 )   $ (37 )   Interest rate swaps — unrealized fair value changes     55       72       84       158     Foreign currency swap — cash settlements     (22 )     —       (22 )     —     Foreign currency     59       1       44       —                                 Total   $ 40     $ 56     $ 33     $ 121                                    During the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, we received cash settlements totaling $52 million and $73 million, respectively, from counterparties to settle our interest rate swaps. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, we received cash settlements totaling $17 million and $37 million, respectively.   In addition to recognizing cash settlements, we recognize unrealized changes in the fair values of our interest rate swaps each reporting period. We estimate the fair values of our interest rate swap financial instruments primarily by using internal discounted cash flow  34    Table of Contents  calculations based upon forward interest-rate yields. The most significant variable to our cash flow calculations for our interest rate swaps is our estimate of future interest rate yields. We base our estimate of future yields upon our own internal model that utilizes forward curves such as the LIBOR or the Federal Funds Rate provided by a third party. We periodically validate our valuation techniques by comparing our internally generated fair value estimates with those obtained from contract counterparties or brokers.   During the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, we incurred unrealized losses of $55 million and $84 million, respectively, resulting primarily from the settlements of our forward starting interest rate swaps in the third quarter of 2011 and changes in interest rates. During the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, we incurred unrealized losses of $72 million and $158 million, respectively as a result of changes in interest rates.   Similar to our commodity derivative contracts, counterparty credit risk is also a component of interest rate and foreign exchange rate derivative valuations. We have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with five separate counterparties. Additionally, our derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either our or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below investment grade. The mark-to-market exposure threshold, above which collateral must be posted, decreases as the debt rating falls further below investment grade. Such thresholds generally range from zero to $55 million for the majority of our contracts. The credit ratings of all our counterparties were investment grade as of September 30, 2011.  Income Taxes   The following table presents our total income tax expense and a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate to the U.S. statutory income tax rate.

Accordingly, we recognized $725 million of deferred tax expense and $19 million of current income tax expense during the second quarter of 2011 related to assumed repatriations of such earnings under current U.S. tax law. These earnings were primarily related to the gains generated from our International divestiture transactions. Excluding the $744 million of tax expense, our effective income tax rate was 33% in the first nine months of 2011.   Also, in the second and third quarters of 2010, we recognized $52 million and $23 million, respectively, of deferred income tax expense related to assumed repatriations of earnings in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Excluding these amounts, our effective income tax rate was 36% in the third quarter of 2010 and 34% in the first nine months ended of 2010.

Earnings increased in the first nine months of 2011 primarily as a result of the $2.5 billion gain ($2.5 billion after-tax) recognized from the divestiture of our Brazil operations. This increase was partially offset by the Azerbaijan divestiture discussed above and a $308 million gain ($235 million after taxes) recognized from the divestiture of our Panyu operations in China during the second quarter of 2010.  Capital Resources, Uses and Liquidity   The following discussion of capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows included in Part I, Item 1.  Sources and Uses of Cash                              Nine Months Ended September 30,         2011     2010         (In millions)       Sources of cash and cash equivalents:                   Operating cash flow — continuing operations   $ 4,227     $ 3,912     Net debt activity     3,657       —     Cash reclassified from discontinued operations     3,251       2,824     Stock option exercises     101       18     Divestitures of property and equipment     13       4,131     Other     21       27                     Total sources of cash and cash equivalents     11,270       10,912                     Uses of cash and cash equivalents:                   Capital expenditures     (5,515 )     (4,793 )   Repurchases of common stock     (1,987 )     (929 )   Net purchases of short-term investments     (1,086 )     —     Dividends     (209 )     (211 )   Net debt activity     —       (1,782 )   Other     (33 )     (13 )                   Total uses of cash and cash equivalents     (8,830 )     (7,728 )                   Increase from continuing operations     2,440       3,184     Decrease from discontinued operations, net of reclassifications to continuing operations     (102 )     (202 )   Effect of foreign exchange rates     (10 )     5                     Net increase in cash and cash equivalents   $ 2,328     $ 2,987                     Cash and cash equivalents at end of period   $ 5,618     $ 3,998                     Short-term investments at end of period   $ 1,231     $ —                       36    Table of Contents  Operating Cash Flow — Continuing Operations   Net cash provided by operating activities (“operating cash flow”) continued to be a significant source of capital and liquidity in the first nine months of 2011. Our operating cash flow increased 8 percent during 2011 largely due to higher current income taxes in 2010 associated with taxable gains on our U.S. Offshore divestitures. Higher commodity prices and production in 2011, partially offset by lower realized gains from our commodity derivatives, also contributed to the increase in cash flow.  Other Sources of Cash — Continuing and Discontinued Operations   As needed, we supplement our operating cash flow and available cash by accessing available credit under our credit facilities and commercial paper program. We may also issue long-term debt to supplement our operating cash flow while maintaining adequate liquidity under our credit facilities. Additionally, we may acquire short-term investments to maximize our income on available cash balances. As needed, we reduce such short-term investment balances to further supplement our operating cash flow and available cash. Another source of cash proceeds comes from employee stock option exercises.   During the first nine months of 2011, we increased our commercial paper borrowings by $3.2 billion and received $0.5 billion from new debt issuances, net of debt maturities. Additionally, we completed the divestiture of our operations in Brazil, generating $3.3 billion in net proceeds, and received proceeds of $101 million from shares issued for employee stock option exercises. We used these sources of cash to fund capital expenditures, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of short-term investments and dividends in excess of the cash flow generated by our United States operating activities.   During the first nine months of 2010, we completed the divestiture of our U.S. Offshore, Azerbaijan and China properties, generating $6.6 billion in pre-tax proceeds net of closing adjustments, or $5.6 billion after taxes. We used proceeds from the 2010 divestitures to repay commercial paper borrowings, retire $350 million of other debt and began repurchasing our common shares. In addition, we redeployed $500 million of proceeds into our North America Onshore properties by acquiring a 50% interest in the Pike oil sands in Alberta, Canada.  Capital Expenditures   Our capital expenditures are presented by geographic area and type in the following table. The amounts in the table reflect cash payments for capital expenditures, including cash paid for capital expenditures incurred in prior quarters. Capital expenditures actually incurred during the first nine months of 2011 and 2010 were approximately $5.6 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively.

The vast majority of our capital expenditures are for the acquisition, drilling and development of oil and gas properties, which totaled $4.9 billion and $4.4 billion in the first nine months of 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding the $500 million Pike oil sands acquisition in 2010, the increase in exploration and development capital spending in the first nine months of 2011 was primarily due to increased drilling and development and new venture acreage acquisitions. With rising oil prices and proceeds from our offshore divestitures, we are increasing our acreage positions and associated exploration and development activities to drive near-term growth of our onshore liquids production.  37    Table of Contents   Capital expenditures for our midstream operations are primarily for the construction and expansion of natural gas processing plants, natural gas pipeline systems and oil pipelines. Our midstream capital expenditures are largely impacted by oil and gas drilling activities. Therefore, the increase in development drilling also increased midstream capital activities.   Capital expenditures related to corporate activities increased in 2011. This increase is largely driven by the construction of our new headquarters in Oklahoma City.  Repurchases of Common Stock   During the first nine months of 2011, we continued repurchasing shares under our $3.5 billion stock repurchase program announced in May 2010. Including unsettled shares, we repurchased 26.0 million common shares for $2.0 billion, or $76.95 per share, in the first nine months of 2011. This program expires on December 31, 2011.  Short-term Investments   During the first nine months of 2011, we had net short-term investment purchases totaling $1.1 billion. These purchases represent our investment of a portion of the International offshore divestiture proceeds into United States Treasury securities and commercial paper. As of September 30, 2011, the average remaining maturity of these short-term investments was 97 days.  Dividends   We paid common stock dividends of $209 million and $211 million in the first nine months of 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts reflect quarterly cash dividend rates of $0.16 per share in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 and $0.17 per share in the second and third quarters of 2011.  Liquidity   Historically, our primary source of capital and liquidity has been operating cash flow and cash on hand. Additionally, we maintain revolving lines of credit and a commercial paper program, which can be accessed as needed to supplement operating cash flow and cash balances. Other available sources of capital and liquidity include equity and debt securities that can be issued pursuant to our automatically effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. We estimate the combination of these sources of capital will be adequate to fund future capital expenditures, share repurchases, debt repayments and our other contractual commitments. The following sections discuss changes to our liquidity subsequent to filing our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Operating Cash Flow   We expect operating cash flow to continue to be our primary source of liquidity. Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil, gas and NGLs produced. To mitigate some of the risk inherent in prices, we have utilized various price swap, fixed-price physical delivery and price collar contracts to set minimum and maximum prices on our 2011 production. As of September 30, 2011, approximately 40 percent of our 2011 gas production is associated with financial price swaps, collars and fixed-price physicals. We also have basis swaps associated with 0.2 Bcf per day of our 2011 gas production. Additionally, approximately 36 percent of our 2011 oil production is associated with financial price collars. We also have call options that, if exercised, would relate to an additional 16 percent of our 2011 oil production.   Looking beyond 2011, we have also entered into contracts to manage the price risk relative to our 2012 and 2013 oil, gas and NGL production. A summary of these contracts as of September 30, 2011, is included in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 1. “Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Form 10-Q.  Offshore Divestitures   In May 2011, we completed the divestiture of our operations in Brazil. With the close of the Brazil transaction, we have substantially completed our planned offshore divestitures. In aggregate, our U.S. and International offshore sales generated total proceeds of $10 billion, or approximately $8 billion after-tax assuming repatriation of a substantial portion of the foreign proceeds under current U.S. tax law.  38    Table of Contents   Furthermore, in connection with the divestiture of our Brazil assets, our remaining deepwater drilling rig and floating, production storage and offloading facility commitments were assumed by the purchaser of the assets.  Credit Availability   In March 2011, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our commercial paper program from $2.2 billion to $5.0 billion.   As of October 21, 2011, we had $1.9 billion of available borrowings under our commercial paper program, and had $2.6 billion of available capacity under our syndicated, unsecured Senior Credit Facility.   The Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, of no more than 65 percent. The credit agreement defines total funded debt as funds received through the issuance of debt securities such as debentures, bonds, notes payable, credit facility borrowings and short-term commercial paper borrowings. In addition, total funded debt includes all obligations with respect to payments received in consideration for oil, gas and NGL production yet to be acquired or produced at the time of payment. Funded debt excludes our outstanding letters of credit and trade payables. The credit agreement defines total capitalization as the sum of funded debt and stockholders’ equity adjusted for noncash financial writedowns, such as full cost ceiling impairments. As of September 30, 2011, we were in compliance with this covenant. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2011, as calculated pursuant to the terms of the agreement, was 22 percent.   Although we ended the third quarter of 2011 with approximately $6.8 billion of cash and short-term investments, the vast majority of this amount consists of proceeds from our International offshore divestitures that are held by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Based on our evaluation of future cash needs across our operations in the United States and Canada, these proceeds continue to be held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not currently expect to repatriate such amounts to the United States. If we were to repatriate a portion or all of the cash and short-term investments held by these foreign subsidiaries, we would be required to accrue and pay current income taxes in accordance with current United States tax law. With these proceeds remaining outside of the United States, we expect to continue using commercial paper borrowings in the United States to supplement our United States based operating cash flow to fund our capital expenditures and common stock repurchase program. Additionally, we do not expect near-term increases in such borrowings will have a material effect on our overall liquidity or financial condition.  Capital Expenditures   We previously disclosed that we expected our 2011 capital expenditures to range from $5.4 billion to $6.0 billion. During 2011, we expanded our Canadian, Permian Basin and new ventures exploration activities, which were all targeted at oil and liquids-rich opportunities. We also increased drilling activity in the liquids-rich portions of the Barnett and Cana shales. Additionally, we are experiencing upward pressure on costs due to industry inflation and a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar. As a result, we increased our total estimated capital expenditures. We now expect our 2011 capital expenditures to approximate $7.3 billion. We anticipate having adequate capital resources to fund our capital expenditures.  Common Stock Repurchase Program   As of October 21, 2011, we had repurchased 47.6 million common shares for $3.4 billion, or $71.32 per share, under our $3.5 billion repurchase program. This program expires on December 31, 2011.  Pension Funding and Estimates   We previously disclosed in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2010, that we expected to contribute $84 million to our qualified pension plans in 2011. During 2011, we increased our estimated contribution to $446 million. As of September 30, 2011, we have fulfilled this commitment. The increase in our 2011 contributions was due to increased discretionary funding.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted   See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 1. “Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Form 10-Q.  39    Table of Contents             Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    Commodity Price Risk   We have commodity derivatives that pertain to production for the last three months of 2011, as well as 2012 and 2013. The key terms to all our oil, gas and NGL derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2011 are presented in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 1. “Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Form 10-Q.   The fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices. At September 30, 2011, a 10 percent increase in the forward curves associated with our gas derivative instruments would have decreased our net asset position by approximately $153 million and a 10 percent decrease would have increased our net asset position by approximately $153 million. A 10 percent increase in the forward curves associated with our oil derivative instruments would have decreased our net asset position by approximately $208 million and a 10 percent decrease would have increased our net asset by approximately $215 million.  Interest Rate Risk   At September 30, 2011, we had debt outstanding of $9.3 billion. Of this amount, $6.1 billion, or 65 percent, bears fixed interest rates averaging 6.3 percent. Additionally, we had $3.2 billion of outstanding commercial paper, bearing interest at floating rates which averaged 0.27 percent.   As of September 30, 2011, we had open interest rate swap positions that are presented in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements under Item 1. “Consolidated Financial Statements” of this Form 10-Q.   The fair values of our interest rate swaps are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the Federal Funds rate and LIBOR. A 10 percent change in these forward curves would not materially impact our balance sheet at September 30, 2011.  Foreign Currency Risk   Our net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the Canadian dollar functional currency. Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period. Revenues, expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period. A 10 percent unfavorable change in the Canadian-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our September 30, 2011 balance sheet.   Our non-Canadian foreign subsidiaries have a U.S. dollar functional currency. However, one of these foreign subsidiaries holds Canadian-dollar cash and engages in short-term intercompany loans with Canadian subsidiaries that are sometimes based in Canadian dollars. Additionally, at September 30, 2011, we held foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange rates on the Canadian-dollar cash. The increase or decrease in the value of the forward contracts is offset by the increase or decrease to the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Canadian-dollar cash. The value of the intercompany loans increases or decreases from the remeasurement of the loans into the U.S. dollar functional currency. Based on the amount of the intercompany loans, a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates would not materially impact our September 30, 2011 balance sheet.             Item 4.   Controls and Procedures    Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to Devon, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify Devon’s financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors.   Based on their evaluation, Devon’s principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that Devon’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of September 30, 2011, to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by Devon in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms.  40    Table of Contents  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There was no change in Devon’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2011 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Devon’s internal control over financial reporting.  41    Table of Contents     PART II.
