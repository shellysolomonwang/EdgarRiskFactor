ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS             Please refer to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2010. For the quarter ending June 30, 2010, Apache notes the following additional risk factors:             Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage or loss of equipment and environmental accidents.             Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:         •   drilling well blowouts, explosions and cratering;         •   pipeline ruptures and spills;         •   fires;         •   formations with abnormal pressures;         •   equipment malfunctions; and         •   hurricanes, which could affect our operations in areas such as the Gulf Coast and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and other natural disasters.             Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flow and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.             Risks Relating to the Mariner Merger             Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on Mariner Energy, Inc.’s (Mariner) employees may have an adverse effect on Mariner and consequently Apache.             The uncertainty created by the pending Merger may impair Mariner’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed as current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Apache. If key employees of Mariner depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become Apache employees, Apache’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger could be reduced or delayed.             The pendency of the Merger could adversely affect Apache.             We may not realize the benefits we anticipated from the Merger.             Certain costs relating to the Merger, including certain investment banking, financing, legal and accounting fees and expenses, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed.    54    Table of Contents              Time demands and commitments related to the Merger may distract management and other employees from current day-to-day responsibilities, preventing Apache from realizing benefits from other existing opportunities.             The Devon and Mariner transactions will increase our exposure to Gulf of Mexico operations.            Our recent acquisition of oil and gas assets on the Gulf of Mexico shelf from Devon Energy Corporation has increased our exposure to Gulf of Mexico operations. Following the completion of the Mariner Merger, an even larger percentage of our exploration and production operations will be related to offshore Gulf of Mexico properties. Greater offshore concentration proportionately increases risks from delays or higher costs common to offshore activity, including severe weather, availability of specialized equipment and compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations.             A drilling moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, or other regulatory initiatives in response to the current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, could adversely affect Apache’s and Mariner’s business.             As has been widely reported, on April 20, 2010, a fire and explosion occurred onboard the semisubmersible drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, leading to the oil spill currently affecting the Gulf of Mexico. In response to this incident, the Minerals Management Service (now known as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or “BOEM”) of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued a notice on May 30, 2010 implementing a six-month moratorium on certain drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Implementation of the moratorium was blocked by a U.S. district court, which was subsequently affirmed on appeal, but on July 12, 2010, the BOEM issued a new moratorium that applies to deep-water drilling operations that use subsea blowout preventers or surface blowout preventers on floating facilities. The new moratorium will last until November 30, 2010, or until such earlier time that the BOEM determines that deep-water drilling operations can proceed safely. The BOEM is also expected to issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and potentially in other geographic regions, and may take other steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production, reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays. This incident could also result in drilling suspensions or other regulatory initiatives in other areas of the U.S. and abroad. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the moratorium or any new guidelines, regulations or legislation, a prolonged suspension of drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and other areas, new regulations and increased liability for companies operating in this sector could adversely affect Apache’s and Mariner’s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as in other offshore locations.             Risks Related to the BP Acquisition             The Mariner and BP transactions will expose us to additional risks and uncertainties with respect to the acquired businesses and their operations.            Although the acquired Mariner and BP businesses will generally be subject to risks similar to those to which we are subject in our existing businesses, the Mariner and BP transactions may increase these risks. For example, the increase in the scale of our operations may increase our operational risks. Recent publicity associated with the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulting from the fire and explosion onboard the Deepwater Horizon, which was under contract to BP, may cause regulatory agencies to scrutinize our operations more closely, as the acquirer of certain of BP’s operations. This additional scrutiny may adversely affect our operations.            We may have difficulty combining the operations of both Mariner and the BP Properties, and the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be achieved.            Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Mariner and BP transactions will depend in part upon whether we can successfully integrate the operations of Mariner and the BP Properties with ours. Our ability to integrate the operations of Mariner and the BP Properties successfully will depend on our ability to monitor operations, coordinate exploration and development activities, control costs, attract, retain and assimilate qualified personnel and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The difficulties of integrating the operations of Mariner and the BP Properties may be increased by the necessity of combining organizations with distinct cultures and widely dispersed operations. The integration of operations following these transactions will require the dedication of management and    55    Table of Contents          other personnel, which may distract their attention from the day-to-day business of the combined enterprise and prevent us from realizing benefits from other opportunities. Completing the integration process may be more expensive than anticipated, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect the integration of these operations smoothly or efficiently or that the anticipated benefits of the transactions will be achieved.            Several significant matters in the BP Acquisition will not be resolved before closing.            Because of the relatively short time period between signing the BP Purchase Agreements and the expected closing of the BP Acquisition, several significant matters commonly resolved prior to closing such an acquisition have been reserved for after closing. For example, title review with respect to most of the BP Properties will not be completed until after closing. In addition, we will not have sufficient time before closing to conduct a full assessment of any environmental and legal liabilities with respect to the BP Properties. As a result, we may discover title defects or adverse environmental or other conditions after we have closed the BP Acquisition and after expiration of the time periods specified in the BP Purchase Agreements during which we may be able to seek, in certain cases, indemnification from or cure of the defect or adverse conditions by BP for such matters. In addition, not all environmental or other conditions that may be identified will be the subject of contractual remedies, however, such contractual remedies may not be adequate for any liabilities we incur.            The reserves, production, revenue and direct operating expense estimates with respect to the BP Properties may differ materially from the actual amounts.            The reserves and production estimates with respect to the BP Properties mentioned in this Form 10-Q are based on our analysis of historical production data, assumptions regarding capital expenditures and anticipated production declines. These estimates of reserves and production are based on estimates of our engineers without review by an independent petroleum engineering firm. Data used to make these estimates were furnished by BP or obtained from publicly available sources. We cannot assure you that these estimates of proved reserves and production are accurate. After such data is reviewed by an independent petroleum engineering firm, the BP Acquisition reserves and production may differ materially from the amounts indicated in this Form 10-Q. In addition, the preliminary revenue and direct operating expense estimates with respect to the BP Properties were provided by BP, are unaudited, and have not been reviewed by our independent accountants. We cannot assure you that these preliminary estimates are accurate, and when we file separate financial statements and pro forma financial information following consummation of the BP Acquisition, such amounts may differ materially from the amounts indicated in this Form 10-Q.            The BP Acquisition and/or our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of the BP entities become the subject of a bankruptcy case.            In light of the extensive costs and liabilities related to the current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, there has been public speculation as to whether one or more of the BP entities will become the subject of a case or proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as “Insolvency Laws”). In the event that one or more of the BP entities were to become the subject of such a case or proceeding, a court may find that the BP Purchase Agreements are executory contracts, in which case such BP entities may, subject to relevant Insolvency Laws, have the right to reject the agreements and refuse to perform their future obligations under them. In this event, our ability to enforce our rights under the BP Purchase Agreements could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if any of the BP entities were to become the subject of such a case or proceeding, and we were unable to consummate the BP Acquisition, we may not be able to collect all or a portion of the full $5.0 billion we have deposited with BP plc pending completion of the acquisition.            Additionally, in a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws, a court may find that the sale of the BP Properties constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance that should be set aside. While the tests for determining whether a transfer of assets constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance vary among jurisdictions, such a determination generally requires that the seller received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation and the seller was insolvent at the time of the transaction, or was rendered insolvent or left with unreasonably small capital to meet its anticipated business needs as a result of the transaction. The applicable time periods for such a finding also vary among jurisdictions, but generally range from two to six years. If a court were to make such    56    Table of Contents          a determination in a proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws, our rights under the BP Purchase Agreements, and our rights to the BP Properties, could be adversely affected.            We will incur significant transaction and BP Acquisition-related costs in connection with the financing of the BP Acquisition, and may be unable to complete alternative financing before closing the BP Acquisition.            We expect to incur, until the closing of the BP Acquisition, significant non-recurring costs associated with the financing of the BP Acquisition, including obtaining and maintaining the committed Bridge Facility that assures our ability to pay the consideration for the BP Acquisition. In addition, we will be subject to numerous market risks in connection with our plan to raise alternative financing to fund the purchase price of the BP Acquisition prior to closing, including risks related to general economic conditions and changes in the costs of capital. In the event less than all of the BP Acquisition purchase price, or applicable portions thereof, is available to us when due and payable, we will be required to draw under the Bridge Facility in order to complete the BP Acquisition.            The failure to complete the BP Acquisition could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and otherwise have an adverse effect on us.            There are a number of conditions to the completion of the BP Acquisition contained in the BP Purchase Agreements that must be satisfied for the transactions to close, and there can be no assurance that the conditions will be satisfied. If we do not complete the acquisition under one or more of the BP Purchase Agreements, the market price of our common stock will likely fall to the extent that the market price reflects an expectation that all of the transactions will be completed. Further, a failed transaction may result in negative publicity and/or negative impression of us in the investment community and may affect our relationships with creditors and other business partners.            If the BP Acquisition is not completed, we also must pay costs related to the BP Acquisition including, among others, legal, accounting and financial advisory, as well as certain fees and expenses with respect to the committed Bridge Facility whether the BP Acquisition is completed or not. We also could be subject to litigation related to the failure to complete the BP Acquisition or other factors, which may adversely affect our business, financial results and stock price. In addition, if the BP Acquisition is not completed, we intend to use the net proceeds in connection with our offerings of common stock, depositary shares and the subsequent debt financing we expect to undertake, for general corporate purposes. However, we would be subject to significant earnings per share dilution and significantly increased leverage as a result.             Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.            The payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. Our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.            The instrument governing our revolving credit facility limits, the Bridge Facility limits, and any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit, our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including the common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing agreements in the future restrict our ability to pay dividends in cash on the mandatory convertible preferred stock, we may be unable to pay dividends in cash on the common stock unless we can refinance amounts outstanding under those agreements.            In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus,” which is defined as the amount by which our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then current and/or the preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.    57    Table of Contents               ITEM 2.
