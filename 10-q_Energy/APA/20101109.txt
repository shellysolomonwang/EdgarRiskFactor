ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS         Please refer to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the nine months ending September 30, 2010, Apache notes the following additional risk factors:           Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage or loss of equipment and environmental accidents.           Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:         •   drilling well blowouts, explosions and cratering;        •   pipeline ruptures and spills;        •   fires;        •   formations with abnormal pressures;        •   equipment malfunctions; and        •   hurricanes, which could affect our operations in areas such as the Gulf Coast and deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and other natural disasters.           Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout or pipeline rupture could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses. If a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flow and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.           Risks Relating to the Mariner Merger           Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on Mariner Energy, Inc.’s (Mariner) employees may have an adverse effect on Mariner and consequently Apache.           The uncertainty created by the pending Merger may impair Mariner’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed as current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Apache. If key employees of Mariner depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become Apache employees, Apache’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger could be reduced or delayed.    58    Table of Contents            The pendency of the Merger could adversely affect Apache.           We may not realize the benefits we anticipated from the Merger.           Certain costs relating to the Merger, including certain investment banking, financing, legal and accounting fees and expenses, must be paid even if the Merger is not completed.           Time demands and commitments related to the Merger may distract management and other employees from current day-to-day responsibilities, preventing Apache from realizing benefits from other existing opportunities.           The Devon and Mariner transactions will increase our exposure to Gulf of Mexico operations.           Our recent acquisition of oil and gas assets on the Gulf of Mexico shelf from Devon Energy Corporation has increased our exposure to Gulf of Mexico operations. Following the completion of the Mariner Merger, an even larger percentage of our exploration and production operations will be related to offshore Gulf of Mexico properties. Greater offshore concentration proportionately increases risks from delays or higher costs common to offshore activity, including severe weather, availability of specialized equipment and compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations.           Any additional deepwater drilling laws and regulations, delays in the processing and approval of permits and other related developments resulting from the recently lifted deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico could adversely affect Apache’s and Mariner’s business.           As has been widely reported, on April 20, 2010, a fire and explosion occurred onboard the semisubmersible drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, leading to the oil spill currently affecting the Gulf of Mexico. In response to this incident, the Minerals Management Service (now known as the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, or BOEMRE) of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) issued a notice on May 30, 2010, implementing a six-month moratorium on certain drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Implementation of the moratorium was blocked by a U.S. district court, which was subsequently affirmed on appeal, but on July12, 2010, the BOEMRE issued a new moratorium that applied to deep-water drilling operations that use subsea blowout preventers or surface blowout preventers on floating facilities. The DOI lifted this moratorium on October 12, 2010. The BOEMRE is expected to issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and potentially in other geographic regions, and may take other steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production, reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays. This incident could also result in drilling suspensions or other regulatory initiatives in other areas of the U.S. and abroad. Although it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of any new guidelines, regulations or legislation, a prolonged suspension of drilling activity in other areas of the U.S. and abroad, new regulations and increased liability for companies operating in this sector could adversely affect Apache’s and Mariner’s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico as well as in other offshore locations.           Risks Related to the BP Acquisition           The Mariner and BP transactions will expose us to additional risks and uncertainties with respect to the acquired businesses and their operations.           Although the acquired Mariner and BP businesses will generally be subject to risks similar to those to which we are subject in our existing businesses, the Mariner and BP transactions may increase these risks. For example, the increase in the scale of our operations may increase our operational risks. Recent publicity associated with the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico resulting from the fire and explosion onboard the Deepwater Horizon, which was under contract to BP, may cause regulatory agencies to scrutinize our operations more closely. This additional scrutiny may adversely affect our operations.    59    Table of Contents            We may have difficulty combining the operations of both Mariner and the BP Properties, and the anticipated benefits of these transactions may not be achieved.           Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Mariner and BP transactions will depend in part upon whether we can successfully integrate the operations of Mariner and the BP Properties with ours. Our ability to integrate the operations of Mariner and the BP Properties successfully will depend on our ability to monitor operations, coordinate exploration and development activities, control costs, attract, retain and assimilate qualified personnel and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The difficulties of integrating the operations of Mariner and the BP Properties may be increased by the necessity of combining organizations with distinct cultures and widely dispersed operations. The integration of operations following these transactions will require the dedication of management and other personnel, which may distract their attention from the day-to-day business of the combined enterprise and prevent us from realizing benefits from other opportunities. Completing the integration process may be more expensive than anticipated, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect the integration of these operations smoothly or efficiently or that the anticipated benefits of the transactions will be achieved.           Several significant matters in the BP Acquisition were not resolved before closing.           Because of the relatively short time period between signing the BP Purchase Agreements and the closing of the acquisition of the BP Properties, several significant matters commonly resolved prior to closing such an acquisition have been reserved for after closing. We did not have sufficient time before closing on the BP Properties to conduct a full title review and environmental assessment. Although remedies are limited for title, we may discover adverse environmental or other conditions after closing and after the time periods specified in the BP Purchase Agreements during which we may be able to seek, in certain cases, indemnification from or cure of the defect or adverse condition by BP for such matters.           The reserves, production, revenue and direct operating expense estimates with respect to the BP Properties may differ materially from the actual amounts.           The reserves and production estimates with respect to the BP Properties mentioned in this Form 10-Q are based on our analysis of historical production data, assumptions regarding capital expenditures and anticipated production declines. These estimates of reserves and production are based on estimates of our engineers without review by an independent petroleum engineering firm. Data used to make these estimates was furnished by BP or obtained from publicly available sources. We cannot assure you that these estimates of proved reserves and production are accurate. After such data is reviewed by an independent petroleum engineering firm, the BP Acquisition reserves and production may differ materially from the amounts indicated in this Form 10-Q.     60    Table of Contents            The BP Acquisition and/or our liabilities could be adversely affected in the event one or more of the BP entities become the subject of a bankruptcy case.           In light of the extensive costs and liabilities related to the current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, there has been public speculation as to whether one or more of the BP entities will become the subject of a case or proceeding under Title11 of the United States Code or any other relevant insolvency law or similar law (which we collectively refer to as “Insolvency Laws”). In the event that one or more of the BP entities were to become the subject of such a case or proceeding, a court may find that the BP Purchase Agreements are executory contracts, in which case such BP entities may, subject to relevant Insolvency Laws, have the right to reject the agreements and refuse to perform their future obligations under them. In this event, our ability to enforce our rights under the BP Purchase Agreements could be adversely affected.            Additionally, in a case or proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws, a court may find that the sale of the BP Properties constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance that should be set aside. While the tests for determining whether a transfer of assets constitutes a constructive fraudulent conveyance vary among jurisdictions, such a determination generally requires that the seller received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation and the seller was insolvent at the time of the transaction, or was rendered insolvent or left with unreasonably small capital to meet its anticipated business needs as a result of the transaction. The applicable time periods for such a finding also vary among jurisdictions, but generally range from two to six years. If a court were to make such a determination in a proceeding under relevant Insolvency Laws, our rights under the BP Purchase Agreements, and our rights to the BP Properties, could be adversely affected.           Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.           The payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors, our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions. Our board of directors is not required to declare dividends on our common stock and may decide not to declare dividends.           Any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including the common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing agreements in the future restrict our ability to pay dividends in cash on the mandatory convertible preferred stock, we may be unable to pay dividends in cash on the common stock unless we can refinance amounts outstanding under those agreements.    61    Table of Contents            In addition, under Delaware law, dividends on capital stock may only be paid from “surplus,” which is defined as the amount by which our total assets exceeds the sum of our total liabilities, including contingent liabilities, and the amount of our capital; if there is no surplus, cash dividends on capital stock may only be paid from our net profits for the then current and/or the preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.
