ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Please refer to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, and as noted above in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-Q. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, Apache notes the following updated risk factor:  Our operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, or loss of equipment, and environmental accidents.  Our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in the drilling, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas, including:        •    well blowouts, explosions, and cratering;        •    pipeline ruptures and spills;        •    fires;        •    formations with abnormal pressures;        •    equipment malfunctions;        •    hurricanes and/or cyclones, which could affect our operations in areas such as on- and offshore the Gulf Coast and Australia, and other natural disasters; and        •    surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives.  Failure or loss of equipment, as the result of equipment malfunctions, cyber-attacks, or natural disasters such as hurricanes, could result in property damages, personal injury, environmental pollution and other damages for which we could be liable. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a well blowout, explosion, or fire at a location where our equipment and services are used, or ground water contamination from hydraulic fracturing chemical additives may result in substantial claims for damages. Ineffective containment of a drilling well blowout, or pipeline rupture or surface spillage and surface or ground water contamination from petroleum constituents or hydraulic fracturing chemical additives could result in extensive environmental pollution and substantial remediation expenses.  If a significant amount of our production is interrupted, our containment efforts prove to be ineffective or litigation arises as the result of a catastrophic occurrence, our cash flows, and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
