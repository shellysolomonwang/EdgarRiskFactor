ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS    Please refer to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the quarter ending March 31, 2010, Apache notes the following additional risk factors:  Risks Relating to the Merger  Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on Mariner Energy, Inc.’s (Mariner) employees may have an adverse effect on Mariner and consequently Apache.  The uncertainty created by the pending merger may impair Mariner’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed as current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with Apache. If key employees of Mariner depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become Apache employees, Apache’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could be reduced or delayed.  The pendency of the merger could adversely affect Apache.  We may not realize the benefits we anticipated from the merger.  Certain costs relating to the merger, including certain investment banking, financing, legal and accounting fees and expenses, must be paid even if the merger is not completed.  Time demands and commitments related to the merger may distract management and other employees from current day-to-day responsibilities, preventing Apache from realizing benefits from other existing opportunities.  Increased exposure to offshore Gulf of Mexico operations.  Following the merger, a larger percentage of Apache’s exploration and production operations will be related to offshore Gulf of Mexico properties. Greater offshore concentration proportionally increases risks from delays or higher costs common to offshore activity including severe weather, availability of specialized equipment and compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations.
