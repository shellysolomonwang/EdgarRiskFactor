ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS           During the quarter ending June 30, 2009, there were no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 other than the following:            Federal climate change regulation could increase our operating and capital costs.            The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (ACES), also known as the Waxman-Markey Bill, was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on June 26, 2009. The ACES, if passed by the U.S. Senate, would establish a variant of a “cap-and-trade” plan for greenhouse gases (GHG) in order to address climate change. A “cap-and-trade” plan would require businesses that emit more greenhouse gases than permitted to acquire emission allowances from other businesses that emit greenhouse gases at levels lower than the limits specified and then surrender these allowances as a credit against such emissions. As a result of such a plan, we could be required to implement costly compliance technology and procedures in the U.S.            Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the ACES, any new federal restrictions on GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade-plan, that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have an adverse effect on our business or demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce in the U.S.            The proposed U.S. federal budget for fiscal year 2010 includes certain provisions that, if passed as originally submitted, will have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.            On February 26, 2009, the Office of Management and Budget released a summary of the proposed U.S. federal budget for fiscal year 2010. The proposed budget repeals many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by U.S. oil and gas companies and imposes new taxes. The provisions include: elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred; increases in the taxation of foreign source income; levy of an excise tax on Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production; repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies; and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers.            Should some or all of these provisions become law our taxes will increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows. This could also reduce our drilling activities in the U.S. Since none of these proposals have yet to be voted on or become law, we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business.            Proposed federal regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our operating and capital costs.            Several proposals are before the U.S. Congress that if implemented would either prohibit the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act. We routinely use fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas to migrate toward the well-bore. It is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations.            Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S.    47    Table of Contents       ITEM 2.
