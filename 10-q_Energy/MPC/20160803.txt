Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream services company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.8 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Northeast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest terminal operations in the United States and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,770 convenience stores in 22 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,400 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.Through our ownership interests in MPLX and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MarkWest, we believe we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the United States, the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions and we distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets. Our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. Our assets include approximately 5,500 MMcf/d of gathering capacity, 7,500 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 500 mbpd of fractionation capacity. We also own more than 5,000 miles of gas gathering and NGL pipelines and have ownership interests in more than 50 gas processing plants, more than 10 NGL fractionation facilities and two condensate stabilization facilities. We own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,400 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX. In previous periods, our inland marine business and our investment in an ocean vessel joint venture, (Crowley Ocean Partners), were presented within our Refining & Marketing segment. They are now presented in our Midstream segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation.Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience merchandise in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. 36Table of Contents •Midstream – includes the operations of MPLX and certain other related operations. The Midstream segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs and transports and stores crude oil and refined products. Executive SummaryResultsSelect results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions, except per share data) 2016 2015 2016 2015Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing$1,080 $1,181 $1,018 $2,473Speedway193 127 360 295Midstream(a)201 103 368 193Net income attributable to MPC$801 $826 $802 $1,717Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$1.51 $1.51 $1.51 $3.14(a) Excludes goodwill impairment charges of $1 million and $130 million for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, as discussed in Acquisitions and Investments and an $89 million equity method investment impairment charge for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016, as discussed in Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Net income attributable to MPC was $801 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in the second quarter and $802 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2016 compared to $826 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, and $1.72 billion, or $3.14 per diluted share, for the same periods of 2015. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $101 million in the second quarter and $1.46 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Segment income includes a non-cash benefit of $360 million and $345 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, related to the reversal of the Company's LCM reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the decreases in both periods were mainly the result of lower crack spreads, primarily in the Gulf Coast.Speedway segment income from operations increased $66 million in the second quarter and $65 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Segment income includes a non-cash benefit of $25 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 related to the reversal of the Company's LCM reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the increases in segment income were primarily due to higher light product and merchandise margins. In addition, in the first six months of 2016, the Speedway segment had a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Midstream segment income from operations increased $98 million in the second quarter and $175 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The increases were primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest’s operating results following the merger with MPLX on December 4, 2015, as well as earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments. MPLX LPAs of June 30, 2016, we owned a 23 percent interest in MPLX, including a two percent general partner interest. On December 4, 2015, MPLX completed the MarkWest Merger. The total value of consideration transferred was $8.61 billion, consisting of $7.33 billion in equity and $1.28 billion in cash. At closing, we made a payment of $1.23 billion to MarkWest common unitholders and the remaining $50 million will be paid in equal amounts, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which will be paid in July 2017, in connection with the conversion of the MPLX Class B units to MPLX common units. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the MarkWest Merger.Private Placement of Preferred UnitsOn May 13, 2016, MPLX completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the “MPLX Preferred Units”) for a cash price of $32.50 per unit. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the MPLX Preferred Units was used for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes. The approximate $1.3 billion of financing from the combination of the ATM issuances in the first quarter and this private placement should provide for MPLX’s anticipated funding needs for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017.37Table of Contents The MPLX Preferred Units rank senior to all MPLX common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. The holders of the MPLX Preferred Units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to $0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of issuance. Following the second anniversary of the issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units, the holders of the MPLX Preferred Units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common units. The MPLX Preferred Units are convertible into MPLX common units on a one for one basis after three years, at the purchasers’ option, and after four years at MPLX’s option, subject to certain conditions. The MPLX Preferred Units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside our control. Therefore, they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have recorded the MPLX Preferred Units at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs. Since the MPLX Preferred Units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future, adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable that the security would become redeemable.Contribution of Inland Marine Business to MPLXOn March 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to MPLX in exchange for 23 million MPLX common units and 460 thousand general partner units. The number of units we received from MPLX was determined by dividing $600 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for the 10 trading days preceding March 14, 2016, pursuant to the Membership Interests Contribution Agreement. We also agreed to waive first-quarter 2016 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions, with respect to the common units issued in this transaction. The contribution of our inland marine business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss. ATM ProgramOn March 4, 2016, MPLX filed a prospectus supplement to its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on March 27, 2015, authorizing the continuous issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings (such continuous offering program, or at-the-market program, referred to as the “ATM Program”). During the six months ended June 30, 2016, MPLX issued an aggregate of 12 million common units under the ATM Program, generating net proceeds of approximately $315 million. As a result of common units issued under the ATM Program during the period, we contributed approximately $6 million in exchange for general partner units to maintain our two percent general partner interest. Distributions from MPLXThe following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during the first six months of 2016 and 2015.  Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions) 2016 2015Cash distributions received from MPLX:   General partner distributions, including IDRs$84 $6Limited partner distributions58 45Total$142 $51The market value of the 79.5 million MPLX common units we owned at June 30, 2016 was $2.7 billion based on the June 30, 2016 closing unit price of $33.63. Over time, we also believe there will be substantial value attributable to our two percent general partnership interest.On July 22, 2016, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.5100 per common unit payable on August 12, 2016. As a result, MPLX will make distributions totaling $222 million to its limited and general partners. MPC’s portion of these distributions is approximately $91 million. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.38Table of Contents Acquisitions and InvestmentsOn August 2, 2016, we announced an agreement with ETP and SXL, subject to closing conditions, to acquire a 9.1875 percent indirect ownership interest in the DAPL and ETCOP projects, collectively referred to as the Bakken Pipeline system, for $500 million. Subject to closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016. Upon closing, MPC has committed to participate in a forthcoming DAPL/ETCOP open season, and subject to the terms and conditions of the open season, make a long-term volume commitment on the Bakken Pipeline system. The Bakken Pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to the Midwest through Patoka, Illinois and ultimately to the Gulf Coast. The Bakken Pipeline system is expected to be ready for service by the end of 2016.ETP and SXL collectively own a 75 percent interest in each of the two joint ventures that are developing the Bakken Pipeline system. MPC and Enbridge Energy Partners will form a new joint venture to acquire 49 percent of ETP and SXL’s 75 percent indirect interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. We will own 25 percent of this new joint venture with Enbridge, which results in our 9.1875 percent indirect ownership interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. We expect to account for our investment as part of our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting. Subject to the closing of the transaction with ETP and SXL, Enbridge Energy Partners and MPC have agreed to the following with respect to MPC’s commitments to the Sandpiper project: a) Enbridge will cancel MPC’s transportation services agreement with respect to the project and release MPC from paying any termination fee per that agreement and b) Enbridge will effect the liquidation of MPC’s member interest in North Dakota Pipeline, which would effectively cancel MPC’s commitment to fund any further construction costs for the project. As of June 30, 2016, we have contributed $301 million to fund our share of the construction costs for the Sandpiper pipeline project. Due to these subsequent events, which were not known or knowable at June 30, 2016, the carrying value of our investment in North Dakota Pipeline is expected to be subject to an impairment review in the third quarter. This review could result in a charge to impair our investment in the project.In June 2016, Speedway and Pilot Flying J signed a definitive agreement for a joint venture consisting of 120 travel plazas, primarily in the Southeast United States. The new entity, PFJ Southeast LLC, will initially consist of 41 existing locations contributed by Speedway and 79 locations contributed by Pilot Flying J, all of which will carry either the Pilot or Flying J brand and will be operated by Pilot Flying J. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances.We currently have ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures with Crowley, which were established to own and operate Jones Act vessels in clean product service.In September 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture, Crowley Ocean Partners, with Crowley. The joint venture will own and operate four new Jones Act product tankers, three of which will be leased to MPC. Contributions to the joint venture occur as each vessel is delivered. Two of the vessels were delivered in 2015, the third was delivered in April 2016 and the fourth is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we contributed $35 million in connection with the delivery of the third vessel. We have contributed a total of $107 million for the first three vessels.In May 2016, MPC and Crowley formed a new ocean vessel joint venture, Crowley Coastal Partners, in which MPC has a 50 percent ownership interest. MPC and Crowley each contributed their 50 percent ownership in Crowley Ocean Partners, discussed above, into Crowley Coastal Partners. In addition, we contributed $48 million in cash and Crowley contributed its 100 percent ownership interest in Crowley Blue Water Partners to Crowley Coastal Partners. Crowley Blue Water Partners is an entity that owns and operates three 750 Series ATB vessels that are leased to MPC. We account for our 50 percent interest in Crowley Coastal Partners as part of our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting.See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on Crowley Coastal Partners as a VIE and Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of Crowley Ocean Partners and Crowley Blue Water Partners and commitments for future contributions to Crowley Ocean Partners.On December 4, 2015, MPLX merged with MarkWest, whereby MarkWest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX. Each common unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the MarkWest Merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of MPLX representing limited partner interests in MPLX, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 per unit. Each Class B unit of MarkWest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one Class B unit of MPLX having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations that the Class B units of MarkWest had immediately prior to the merger. At closing, we contributed $1.23 billion in cash to MPLX to pay the cash consideration to MarkWest common unitholders. We will contribute an 39Table of Contents additional total of $50 million in cash to MPLX for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the MPLX Class B units to MPLX common units in equal installments, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which will be paid in July 2017. These contributions are with respect to MPC’s existing interests in MPLX (including IDRs) and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in MPLX. We assigned the total consideration transferred of $8.61 billion, including the $7.33 billion fair value of the equity consideration and the $1.28 billion of cash contributions, to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interest assumed in the MarkWest Merger, with the excess recorded as goodwill. During the first quarter of 2016, the preliminary fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded in the 2015 year-end financial statements were revised based on additional analysis. These adjustments to the fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and equity investments, among other items, resulted in an offsetting reduction to goodwill of approximately $241 million. As a result, we recognized total assets acquired of $11.91 billion, including $8.52 billion of property plant and equipment and $2.60 billion of equity investments, and total liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed of $5.51 billion, including $4.57 billion of assumed debt. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances. MPLX recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the first quarter to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. In the second quarter of 2016, MPLX completed its purchase price allocation, which resulted in an additional $1 million of impairment expense that would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2016 had the purchase price allocation been completed as of that date. This adjustment to the impairment expense was the result of completing an evaluation of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the MarkWest Merger and their impact on the resulting goodwill that was recognized.See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a discussion of this interim assessment of goodwill. See Note 14 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on goodwill recorded from the MarkWest Merger. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the acquisition.Consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business, the MarkWest Merger combines one of the nation’s largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by MPC. The complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of MarkWest, MPLX and MPC provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. The combined entity will further MarkWest's leading midstream presence in the Marcellus and Utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects, which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions. In addition, the combination provides significant vertical integration opportunities, as MPC is a large consumer of NGLs.Share Repurchases Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.36 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.64 billion available for repurchases. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we have acquired 4 million common shares at an average cost per share of $40.52 under these authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.LiquidityAs of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.75 billion, an unused $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility and approximately $758 million of availability under our $1.0 billion trade receivables securitization facility based on eligible trade receivables. Availability under MPC’s trade receivables facility is a function of eligible accounts receivable, which will be lower in a sustained lower refined product price environment. As of June 30, 2016, we do not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. The above amounts exclude MPLX’s $2.0 billion bank revolving credit facility, which as of June 30, 2016, had no borrowings and $8 million letters of credit outstanding. On July 20, 2016, we amended our trade receivables securitization facility (“trade receivables facility”) to, among other things, reduce the capacity from $1 billion to $750 million and to extend the maturity date to July 19, 2019. The reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment.On July 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing MPC bank revolving credit facility due in 2017. The new agreement provides for a four-year $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on 40Table of Contents July 20, 2020. Additionally, we entered into a 364-day $1 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on July 19, 2017. The financial covenants contained in these agreements remain the same as under the previous bank revolving credit facility.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our business strategies and growth and vertical integration opportunities with respect to our midstream assets, the pending joint venture with Pilot Flying J, the timing of delivery of the vessel to Crowley Ocean Partners, our investment in the Bakken Pipeline system and the related cancellation of our commitment to fund the Sandpiper pipeline project, and the timing and amount of the impairment related to the Sandpiper project and our share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect our business strategies and growth and vertical integration opportunities with respect to our midstream assets include, but are not limited to, volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions, our ability to implement and realize the benefits and synergies of our strategic initiatives, availability of liquidity, actions taken by competitors, regulatory approvals and operating performance. Factors that could affect the pending joint venture with Pilot Flying J include, but are not limited to, our ability to successfully close the pending joint venture, including, without limitation, satisfying customary closing conditions. Factors that could affect delivery of the vessel to Crowley Ocean Partners include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and the ability to complete the vessel on the anticipated terms and timetable. Factors that could affect our investment in the Bakken Pipeline system and the related cancellation of our commitment to fund the Sandpiper pipeline project, and the timing and amount of the impairment related to the Sandpiper project include, but are not limited to, the parties’ ability to satisfy closing conditions in the third quarter of 2016. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ULSD and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like Brent crude. In recent years, domestic U.S. crude oils, such as WTI and LLS, have traded at prices less than Brent due to the growth in U.S. crude oil production, logistical constraints and other market factors. These price discounts had favorably impacted the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. The decline in crude oil prices in 2015 and continuing into the first quarter of 2016 has led to declines in sequential (month on month) onshore U.S. crude oil production and narrowed the LLS discount to Brent. With the end of the ban on U.S. crude oil exports, LLS and Brent are expected to trade near parity. Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.41Table of Contents The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax)  LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)$450Sweet/sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)220LLS-WTI differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)90Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change)140(a) Weighted 40 percent Chicago and 60 percent USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.(b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].(c) Assumes 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;•our refinery yields;•the selling prices realized for refined products;•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; •the cost of products purchased for resale; •the effect of changes to refined product prices on LCM inventory valuation reserves; and•the impact of liquidations of LIFO inventory layers with costs significantly above current market prices.Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. As of December 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value by $370 million, of which $345 million was allocated to our Refining & Marketing segment. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the LCM reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover. The cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks, refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the LIFO method. During the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a permanent reduction in our refined products inventories for LIFO accounting purposes. The cost of these inventories was based on prices in early 2015, which were much higher than current prices. As a result, we recognized a pre-tax charge of approximately $54 million in connection with this LIFO inventory reduction. There were no liquidation of LIFO inventories for the six months ended June 30, 2015.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Costs for planned turnaround, major maintenance and engineering projects are expensed in the period incurred. We had significantly more planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries during the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, transportation fuel prices, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway’s gross margin. Speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.42Table of Contents Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. As of December 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value by $370 million, of which $25 million was allocated to our Speedway segment. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the LCM reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover. MidstreamNGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability. The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines and marine vessels serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.43Table of Contents Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions) 2016 2015 Variance 2016 2015 VarianceRevenues and other income:           Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$16,811 $20,537 $(3,726) $29,566 $37,728 $(8,162)Income (loss) from equity method investments(50) 20 (70) (28) 35 (63)Net gain (loss) on disposal of assets— (1) 1 25 4 21Other income29 25 4 57 54 3Total revenues and other income16,790 20,581 (3,791) 29,620 37,821 (8,201)Costs and expenses:           Cost of revenues (excludes items below)12,830 16,366 (3,536) 22,531 29,410 (6,879)Purchases from related parties124 82 42 231 158 73Inventory market valuation adjustment(385) — (385) (370) — (370)Consumer excise taxes1,893 1,939 (46) 3,719 3,771 (52)Impairment expense1 — 1 130 — 130Depreciation and amortization500 362 138 990 725 265Selling, general and administrative expenses401 393 8 779 751 28Other taxes111 104 7 220 201 19Total costs and expenses15,475 19,246 (3,771) 28,230 35,016 (6,786)Income from operations1,315 1,335 (20) 1,390 2,805 (1,415)Net interest and other financial income (costs)(137) (64) (73) (279) (145) (134)Income before income taxes1,178 1,271 (93) 1,111 2,660 (1,549)Provision for income taxes395 432 (37) 406 918 (512)Net income783 839 (56) 705 1,742 (1,037)Less net income (loss) attributable to:           Redeemable noncontrolling interest9 — 9 9 — 9Noncontrolling interests(27) 13 (40) (106) 25 (131)Net income attributable to MPC$801 $826 $(25) $802 $1,717 $(915)Net income attributable to MPC decreased $25 million in the second quarter and $915 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. In both periods of 2016, decreases in income from operations for our Refining & Marketing segment were partially offset by increases in our Speedway and Midstream segments. Income from operations includes a non-cash benefit related to the reversal of the Company’s LCM reserve of $385 million and $370 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively. Items not allocated to segments include an $89 million impairment charge related to an equity method investment held by MPLX. See Segment Results for additional information.Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $3.73 billion in the second quarter and $8.16 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The decreases were primarily due to lower average refined product sales prices which decreased $0.43 per gallon and $0.47 per gallon, for the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively. Income (loss) from equity method investments decreased $70 million in the second quarter and $63 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to an impairment charge of $89 million related to an equity method investment held by MPLX, partially offset by increases in income from our pipeline and marine affiliates. Net gain on disposal of assets increased $21 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016.44Table of Contents Cost of revenues decreased $3.54 billion in the second quarter and $6.88 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The decreases were primarily due to:•decreases in refined product cost of sales of $3.3 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, primarily due to decreases in raw material costs; partially offset by•increases in refinery direct operating costs of $71 million, or $0.61 per barrel of total refinery throughput, and $302 million, or $1.11 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to increased planned turnaround activity in 2016. Purchases from related parties increased $42 million in the second quarter and $73 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to:•increases in volumes transported by by Illinois Extension Pipeline, which is a pipeline affiliate that became operational in December 2015, of $28 million and $55 million, respectively;•increases in transportation services provided by Crowley Ocean Partners, which is a new marine joint venture established in September of 2015, of $17 million and $23 million, respectively;•increases in condensate processing services provided by Ohio Condensate of $3 million and $6 million, respectively;•decreases in prices for ethanol purchases, partially offset by increases in volume from TAME, TACE, and TAAE of $6 million and $9 million, respectively; and •decreases in transportation services provided by Explorer of $1 million and $6 million, respectively.Inventory market valuation adjustment decreased costs and expenses by $385 million in the second quarter and $370 million for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The December 31, 2015 LCM reserve of $370 million was reversed due to the sale of inventory quantities that gave rise to the 2015 reserve and a new LCM reserve of $385 million was established as of March 31, 2016 based on market prices at that time. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost due to increases in refined product prices during the second quarter and we reversed the LCM reserve resulting in reductions to cost of revenues of $385 million for the second quarter and $370 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Consumer excise taxes decreased $46 million in the second quarter and $52 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to decreases in taxable refined product sales volumes and tax rates in certain locations.Impairment expense reflects a $1 million impairment charge recorded by MPLX in the second quarter and $130 million in the first six months of 2016 to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a discussion of the interim impairment assessment of goodwill.Depreciation and amortization increased $138 million in the second quarter and increased $265 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the MarkWest Merger.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8 million in the second quarter and $28 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest’s expenses, partially offset by a decrease in employee benefit expenses.Other taxes increased $7 million in the second quarter and $19 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest’s property taxes. Net interest and other financial costs increased $73 million in the second quarter and $134 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to interest on the debt assumed in the MarkWest Merger. Provision for income taxes decreased $37 million in the second quarter and $512 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to decreases in income before income taxes of $93 million in the second quarter and $1.55 billion in the first six months of 2016. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 varies from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent tax differences related to the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, including their proportional share of the goodwill impairment charge recorded by MPLX, the domestic manufacturing deduction and state and local tax expense. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 is equivalent to or slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. 45Table of Contents Segment ResultsRevenuesRevenues, including intersegment sales, are summarized by segment in the following table.

Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $101 million in the second quarter and $1.46 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Segment income includes a non-cash benefit of $360 million and $345 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, related to the reversal of the Company's LCM reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the decrease in the second quarter was mainly the result of lower crack spreads and less favorable effects of changes in market structure compared to the spot market reference prices. These decreases were partially offset by the effects of more favorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil. The decrease in the first six months of 2016 was primarily the result of lower crack spreads, unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil, and higher operating costs, primarily related to increased turnaround activity, partially offset by more favorable product price realizations and the favorable effects of changes in market structure compared to the spot market reference prices. The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment’s business.

Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, mix and crude costs, as well as the effects of inventory valuation adjustments, market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had estimated positive impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income of $258 million for the second quarter and $175 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

The increases in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs were primarily attributable to significant turnaround costs incurred by the Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and the Garyville refinery in the second quarter of 2016. Other manufacturing costs were consistent with the second quarter and first six months of 2015.We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with purchased RINs increased to $78 million in the second quarter and $141 million in the first six months of 2016 from $75 million in the second quarter and $117 million in the first six months of 2015. The second quarter of 2015 includes a $46 million charge to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance with the renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015, particularly those for bio-mass based diesel and advanced biofuels. Excluding this charge, the increases for both periods of 2016 were primarily due to the effect of increased prices for bio-mass based diesel RINs.Speedway segment income from operations increased $66 million in the second quarter and $65 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Segment income includes a non-cash benefit of $25 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 related to the reversal of the Company's LCM reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the increases in segment income were primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $35 million, or $0.0198 per gallon, and $2 million, or $0.0038 per gallon, respectively, increases in merchandise margins of $10 million and $29 million, respectively. In addition, for the first six months of 2016, the Speedway segment had a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location, partially offset by higher operating expenses.The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment.

Changes in working capital were a net $771 million source of cash in the first six months of 2016 compared to a net $292 million use of cash in the first six month of 2015. The changes in working capital were primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in inventories, partially offset by an increase in current receivables. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt. Changes from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable increased $471 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil prices.•Current receivables increased $272 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil prices, partially offset by lower volumes.•Inventories decreased $16 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to decreases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes partially offset by a $370 million reversal of the Company’s LCM inventory valuation reserve. The net $292 million use of cash from working capital changes in the first six months of 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventory. Changes from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable decreased $436 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil prices.•Current receivables decreased $182 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil prices. •Inventories decreased $102 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to decreases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. Net cash used in investing activities was $640 million higher in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily due to increases in additions to property, plant and equipment, primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest capital spending, and acquisitions and investments in affiliates, partially offset by an increase in disposal of assets.51Table of Contents The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash.

Net cash contributed to equity method investments increased $25 million for the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily due to contributions to our marine joint ventures of $82 million, MPLX equity affiliates of $39 million, Illinois Extension Pipeline of $24 million to fund the SAX pipeline project and North Dakota Pipeline of $14 million to fund our portion of the Sandpiper pipeline project as compared to our contributions to Illinois Extension Pipeline of $94 million and North Dakota Pipeline of $44 million in the first six months of 2015. Cash from disposal of assets increased primarily due to the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016.Financing activities were a net $467 million use of cash in the first six months of 2016 compared to a net $941 million use of cash in the first six months of 2015. The sources of cash in 2016 included the issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units and common units and long-term debt borrowings which were more than offset by uses of cash which included long-term debt repayments, dividend payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and common stock repurchases under our share repurchase authorizations. In addition, in the first six months of 2016, uses of cash also included a significant portion of the contingent consideration payment to the seller of the Galveston Bay refinery.Long-term debt borrowings and repayments, including debt issuance costs, were a net $893 million use of cash in the first six months of 2016 compared to a net $97 million source of cash in the first six months of 2015. During the first six months of 2016, MPLX used proceeds from its issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units to repay amounts outstanding under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility. During the first six months of 2015, MPLX used proceeds from its $500 million of MPLX Senior Notes to repay amounts outstanding under the MPLX Credit Agreement, as well as for general partnership purposes.52Table of Contents Cash used in common stock repurchases decreased $491 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases for these periods. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase authorizations.

As of June 30, 2016, noncontrolling interests held a 77 percent interest in MPLX, compared to a 29.5 percent interest as of June 30, 2015.Cash used in dividend payments increased $67 million in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily due to a $0.14 per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our dividend payments were $0.64 per common share in the first six months of 2016 compared to $0.50 per common share in the first six months of 2015.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.Capital ResourcesOur liquidity totaled $5.01 billion at June 30, 2016 consisting of:  June 30, 2016(In millions) Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings AvailableCapacityBank revolving credit facility(a)$2,500 $— $2,500Trade receivables facility(b)758 — 758Total$3,258 $— $3,258Cash and cash equivalents    1,754Total liquidity    $5,012(a) Excludes MPLX’s $2.0 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had $1.99 billion available as of June 30, 2016.(b) Availability under our $1.0 billion trade receivables facility is a function of eligible trade receivables, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products. As of July 31, 2016, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $735 million.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.On July 20, 2016, we amended our trade receivables securitization facility (“trade receivables facility”) to, among other things, reduce the capacity from $1 billion to $750 million and to extend the maturity date to July 19, 2019. The reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment.On July 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing MPC bank revolving credit facility due in 2017. The new agreement provides for a four-year $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on July 20, 2020. Additionally, we entered into a 364-day $1 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on July 19, 2017. The financial covenants contained in these agreements remain the same as under the previous bank revolving credit facility.On February 26, 2016, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2016, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. 53Table of Contents The MPC term loan agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”), MPC bank revolving credit facility and MPLX credit agreement, which provides for the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and the MPLX term loan facility (“MPLX Credit Agreement”), contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.30 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. As of June 30, 2016, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.6 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of June 30, 2016, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. CompanyRating AgencyRatingMPCMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook) FitchBBB (stable outlook)MPLXMoody’sBaa3 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB- (stable outlook) FitchBBB- (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.Neither the Term Loan Agreement, MPC bank revolving credit facility, MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the Term Loan Agreement, the MPC bank revolving credit facility, our trade receivables securitization facility and debt held by one of our ocean vessel joint ventures. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis or result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.54Table of Contents Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 36 percent at June 30, 2016 and 38 percent at December 31, 2015.(In millions)June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Debt due within one year$27 $29Long-term debt11,032 11,896Total debt$11,059 $11,925Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$11,059 $11,925Total equity19,935 19,675Total capital$30,994 $31,600Debt-to-total-capital ratio36% 38%Capital RequirementsOur board approved a 2016 capital spending and investment plan of $4.2 billion towards the end of 2015. In light of current market conditions and revisions to expected completion dates for certain projects, we expect 2016 capital spending and investments to be approximately $3.0 billion, excluding capitalized interest. The expected 2016 capital spending and investments also excludes our anticipated $500 million investment in the Bakken Pipeline system. This reduced forecast for capital spending and investments includes spending on refining, retail marketing and midstream projects as well as amounts designated for corporate projects. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, our capital expenditures and investments were $1.44 billion, excluding capitalized interest. There have been no material changes to our 2016 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.During the second quarter of 2016, we paid BP $200 million for the third year’s contingent earnout. Including this second quarter payment, we have paid BP approximately $569 million in total leaving $131 million remaining under the total cap of $700 million. See Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the second quarter of 2016. At June 30, 2016, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If market conditions were to change and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of June 30, 2016, our equity investment in Centennial was $35 million and we had a $31 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial’s outstanding debt. See Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we made no voluntary contributions to our funded pension plans. We have no required funding for 2016, but plan to make a $175 million voluntary contribution in the third quarter of 2016.On July 27, 2016, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.36 per share on common stock. The dividend is payable September 12, 2016, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 17, 2016. During the first six months of 2016, we paid $126 million to acquire 4 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $40.52 per delivered share. Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations. As of June 30, 2016, we had $2.64 billion of remaining share repurchase authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.We may utilize various methods to effect additional share repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future share repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.55Table of Contents The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our capital requirements, including our capital spending and budget plan, the contingent earnout payment to the seller of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment, future contributions to our funded pension plans and share repurchases. Forward-looking statements about our capital requirements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking statements regarding capital requirements include the availability of liquidity, business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets, market price of our common stock, prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions, the effects of the lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban, completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the U.S. Midwest, our ability to successfully achieve the strategic and other expected objectives relating to the MarkWest Merger, modifications to MPLX earnings and distribution growth objectives, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Contractual Cash Obligations As of June 30, 2016, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first six months of 2016, our long-term debt commitments decreased $1.21 billion due to repayment of borrowings under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility. Also, during the first six months of 2016, our long-term transportation commitments, beginning in 2018, decreased $432 million due to the suspension of a pipeline project for which the Company had made a commitment under a Transportation Services Agreement. As discussed in Note 23 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, on August 2, 2016 we announced an anticipated investment of $500 million for an indirect ownership interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. MPC also expects to become a committed shipper on the Bakken Pipeline system. Subject to the closing of this investment, Enbridge has agreed to cancel our commitment under a long-term transportation services agreement related to the Sandpiper pipeline project and our commitment to fund a portion of the construction of the pipeline. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under U.S. GAAP. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.56Table of Contents Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $600 million to $700 million between 2014 and 2021 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards, which includes estimated capital expenditures of approximately $200 million in 2017.There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the six months ended June 30, 2016.Critical Accounting EstimatesImpairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method InvestmentsAs of June 30, 2016, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except as noted below. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit. During the first quarter of 2016, MPLX, our consolidated subsidiary, determined that an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was necessary based on consideration of a number of first quarter events and circumstances, including i) continued deterioration of near term commodity prices as well as longer term pricing trends, ii) recent guidance on reductions to forecasted capital spending, the slowing of drilling activity and the resulting reduced production growth forecasts released or communicated by MPLX’s producer customers and iii) increases in the cost of capital. The combination of these factors was considered to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test. Based on the first step of the interim goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value for the three reporting units to which goodwill was assigned in connection with the MarkWest Merger was less than their respective carrying value. In step two of the impairment analysis, the implied fair values of the goodwill were compared to the carrying values within those reporting units. Based on this assessment, it was determined that goodwill was impaired in two of the reporting units. Accordingly, MPLX recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the first quarter of 2016.The fair value of the reporting units for the interim goodwill impairment analysis was determined based on applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the expected future results and discount rates, which ranged from 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent. The fair value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which is an income approach. Key assumptions include attrition rates by reporting unit ranging from 5.0 percent to 10.0 percent and discount rates by reporting unit ranging from 11.5 percent to 12.8 percent. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.MPLX did not record an impairment charge for one reporting unit assigned goodwill. As of March 31, 2016, MPLX’s allocation of the purchase price was provisional. Based on MPLX’s assessment as of that date, this reporting unit had $1.81 billion of goodwill assigned to it (which amount was not adjusted as of June 30, 2016 when MPLX finalized its purchase price allocation). Step one of the first quarter interim impairment analysis resulted in the carrying value of this reporting unit exceeding its fair value by 0.62%; therefore, MPLX completed Step two of the goodwill impairment analysis. Step two of the goodwill impairment analysis requires MPLX to determine the fair value of all assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests, if any, of the reporting unit, whether or not currently recognized. The implied fair value of goodwill is the residual value of the reporting unit's fair value, less the fair value of the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests, if any. The results of MPLX’s 57Table of ContentsStep two first quarter interim impairment analysis concluded that the fair value of the goodwill of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of $1.81 billion by approximately $20 million, or 1.2%. An increase of 0.50% to the discount rate used to estimate this reporting unit’s fair value as of MPLX’s first quarter interim impairment analysis would have resulted in an additional goodwill impairment charge of more than $400 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The other significant assumption used to estimate this reporting unit's fair value included estimates of future cash flows. If estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by commodity prices and producers' production plans, for this reporting unit were to decline, the overall reporting unit's fair value would decrease, resulting in a potential goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, an increase in the cost of capital would result in a decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit, causing its value to decline and goodwill to potentially be impaired.During the second quarter of 2016, MPLX determined that an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was not necessary. The stabilization and, in some cases, improvement in the second quarter of the circumstances considered during its first quarter impairment analysis, the date of its last full goodwill impairment analysis, lead to its conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their respective carrying values.  In the second quarter of 2016, MPLX completed its purchase price accounting for the MarkWest Merger. The completion of this accounting resulted in additional goodwill attributed to certain reporting units for which an impairment charge had been taken in the first quarter of 2016. MPLX therefore recorded an additional $1 million of impairment expense in the second quarter of 2016.Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flows of an asset group. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. In the first quarter of 2016, MPLX also considered whether there was any indication of impairment of long-lived assets and equity method investments recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger and determined that there were none.MPLX’s investments in Centrahoma, Jefferson Dry Gas, MarkWest Utica EMG, Ohio Condensate and MarkWest Pioneer were recorded at fair value based on the MarkWest Merger on December 4, 2015. If expected cash flows used to determine the fair value as of December 4, 2015 are not realized its equity method investments may be subject to future impairment charges. Based on a review of cash flow forecasts as of the second quarter of 2016, MPLX has concluded that no indicators of an other than temporary impairment exist except for Ohio Condensate as discussed further below.During the second quarter of 2016, forecasts for Ohio Condensate, an equity method investment, were reduced in line with updated forecasts for customer requirements. As the operator of that entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, MPLX completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of June 30, 2016, in accordance with ASC Topic 360, to determine the potential fixed asset impairment charge. The resulting fixed asset impairment charge recorded within Ohio Condensate’s financial statements was $96 million. Based on MPLX’s 60 percent ownership of Ohio Condensate, approximately $58 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in Income (loss) from equity method investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.MPLX’s investment in Ohio Condensate, which was established at fair value in connection with the MarkWest Merger, exceeded its share of the underlying net assets. Therefore, in conjunction with the ASC Topic 360 impairment analysis, MPLX completed an equity method impairment analysis in accordance with ASC Topic 323 to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated financial statements resulting from an other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, an additional impairment charge of approximately $31 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in Income (loss) from equity method investments within the accompanying consolidated statements of income, which eliminated the basis differential established in connection with the MarkWest Merger.The fair value of Ohio Condensate and its underlying assets was determined based upon applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the expected future results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and a discount rate of 11.9%. An increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points would have resulted in an additional charge of $1 million on the consolidated statements of income. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As such, the fair value of the Ohio Condensate equity method investment and its underlying assets represents a Level 3 measurement. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.58Table of Contents Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted As discussed in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future.59Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.See Notes 15 and 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of June 30, 2016 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after June 30, 2016 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt, including the portion classified as current and excluding capital leases, as of June 30, 2016 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(In millions) Fair Value as of June 30, 2016(a) Change inFair Value(b) Change in Net Income for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016(c)Long-term debt     Fixed-rate$10,246  $846 n/aVariable-rate950 n/a 7(a) Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(b) Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at June 30, 2016.(c) Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2016, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX term loan facility. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX term loan facility, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.60Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.61Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing(a)(b)$1,080 $1,181 $1,018 $2,473Speedway(b)193 127 360 295Midstream(a)(c)201 103 368 193Items not allocated to segments:        Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(c)(67) (75) (134) (154) Pension settlement expenses(2) (1) (3) (2) Impairments(d)(90) — (219) —Income from operations$1,315 $1,335 $1,390 $2,805Capital Expenditures and Investments(e)       Refining & Marketing(a)$278 $207 $521 $430Speedway70 100 120 145Midstream(a)403 157 753 244Corporate and Other(f)36 49 77 78Total$787 $513 $1,471 $897(a) We revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX; our inland marine business, which was previously included in Refining & Marketing, is now included in Midstream.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.LitigationWe are a party to a number of lawsuits and proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, in July 2015, a purported class action lawsuit asserting claims challenging the MarkWest Merger was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by a purported unitholder of MarkWest. In August 2015, two similar putative class action lawsuits were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by plaintiffs who purport to be unitholders of MarkWest. On September 9, 2015, these lawsuits were consolidated into one action pending in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, now captioned In re MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. Unitholder Litigation. On October 1, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint against the individual members of the board of directors of MarkWest Energy GP, L.L.C. (the “MarkWest GP Board”), MPLX, MPLX GP, MPC and Sapphire Holdco LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX, asserting in connection with the MarkWest Merger and related disclosures that, among other things, (i) the MarkWest GP Board breached its duties in approving the MarkWest Merger with MPLX and (ii) MPC, MPLX, MPLX GP, and Sapphire Holdco LLC aided and abetted such breaches. On February 4, 2016, the Court approved a stipulation and proposed order to dismiss all claims with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs, but the Court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate a fee application by the plaintiffs’ counsel for an award of attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of expenses. On March 28, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an application for reimbursement of approximately $2 million of legal fees and expenses. On May 17, 2016, the plaintiffs withdrew the fee application and the case is now dismissed.Environmental ProceedingsOn May 18, 2016, MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources, L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX (“MarkWest Liberty Midstream”), received a draft Consent Order (“Consent Order”) from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (“WVDEP”) alleging certain air permitting and emissions violations at our Sherwood Facility, a gas processing facility located in West Virginia, including failure to comply with monitoring, tagging, recordkeeping and repair requirements with respect to certain equipment at the facility as well as the failure to comply with certain permit application requirements. The Consent Order sets forth a proposed civil penalty of $425,000. On July 6, 2016, the EPA presented a draft administrative enforcement order to Cincinnati Renewable Fuels LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC that operates a biofuels production facility in Cincinnati, Ohio (“CRF”). The order alleges CRF and its predecessors failed to implement air regulations for a period beginning in May 2008 and prior to our acquisition of the facility. The EPA may seek penalties in excess of $100,000 in connection with this matter. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (“IEPA”) initiated an enforcement action against Marathon Pipe Line LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX (“MPL”), in connection with an April 17, 2016 pipeline release to the Wabash River near Crawleyville, Indiana. MPL also received a Clean Water Act request for information from the EPA in furtherance of its investigation of possible violations arising from the April 17, 2016 pipeline release. The IEPA and the EPA may each seek penalties in excess of $100,000 in connection with this matter.As previously reported, in July 2015, representatives from the EPA and the United States Department of Justice entered a MarkWest Liberty Midstream pipeline launcher/receiver site utilized for pipeline maintenance operations in Washington County, Pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant issued by a magistrate of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. MarkWest Liberty Midstream has provided information in response to subpoenas presented by the government and similar requests for information from the EPA, state and other agencies related to MarkWest's pipeline and compressor stations located in Pennsylvania. MarkWest is engaged in ongoing discussions with the EPA and the U.S. Attorney’s office regarding alleged omissions associated with permits or related regulatory obligations for its launcher/receiver facilities in the region. MarkWest Liberty Midstream’s internal review has determined that its operations have been conducted consistent with industry practices and in a manner protective of its employees and the public. It is possible however, that in connection with any potential or asserted civil or criminal enforcement action associated with this matter, MarkWest Liberty Midstream will incur material assessments, penalties or fines, incur material defense costs and expenses, be required to modify 65Table of Contentsoperations or construction activities which could increase operating costs and capital expenditures, or be subject to other obligations or restrictions that could restrict or prohibit our activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The amount of any potential assessments, penalties, fines, restrictions, requirements, modifications, costs or expenses that may be incurred in connection with any potential enforcement action cannot be reasonably estimated or determined at this time.We are involved in a number of environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 66Table of Contents Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
