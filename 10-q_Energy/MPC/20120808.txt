Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The Spinoff and Basis of Presentation  On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its RM&T Business into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil common stock. In accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between Marathon Oil and MPC, the distribution of MPC common stock was made on June 30, 2011, with Marathon Oil stockholders receiving one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon Oil common stock. Following the Spinoff, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in MPC, and each company had separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. On July 1, 2011, our common stock began trading “regular-way” on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “MPC”.  Prior to the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, our results of operations and cash flows consisted of the RM&T Business, which represented a combined reporting entity. Subsequent to the Spinoff, our results of operations and cash flows consist of consolidated MPC activities. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The consolidated statements of income for periods prior to the Spinoff include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by Marathon Oil, including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, procurement and information technology. Those allocations were based primarily on specific identification, headcount or computer utilization. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from Marathon Oil, are reasonable. However, the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a stand-alone company during those periods presented prior to the Spinoff and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Subsequent to the Spinoff, we are performing these functions using internal resources or services provided by third parties, certain of which were provided by Marathon Oil during a transition period pursuant to a transition services agreement, which terminated on June 30, 2012.  Corporate Overview  We are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. We currently own and operate six refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.2 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered.  Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer.    27    Table of Contents     •    Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our six refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway segment and to dealers and jobbers who operate Marathon® retail outlets;        •    Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway® convenience stores; and        •    Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes, among other transportation-related assets, a majority interest in LOOP, which is the owner and operator of the only U.S. deepwater oil port.  We reported net income of $814 million and $1.41 billion, or $2.38 and $4.07 per diluted share, for the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to net income of $802 million and $1.33 billion, or $2.24 and $3.72 per diluted share, for the second quarter and first six months of 2011. The increases were primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment, which generated income from operations of $1.33 billion and $2.27 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to $1.26 billion and $2.06 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2011. The increases in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations were due to an improved Refining & Marketing gross margin, which was primarily a result of a larger Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil (“LLS”) 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread, partially offset by unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs. The increase in the first six months was also due to wider differentials between West Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”) and other light sweet crudes such as LLS and an increase in WTI-priced crude oil volumes.  The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project continues to be a significant portion of our 2012 capital spending. As of June 30, 2012, the project was approximately 96 percent complete and on budget and on schedule to complete construction in the third quarter of 2012. Immediately following the completion of construction, there will be a 70-day turnaround with the expanded Detroit refinery anticipated to be online by year end 2012.  Our Speedway segment generated income from operations of $107 million and $157 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to income from operations of $80 million and $113 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2011. The increases were primarily due to increases in our merchandise gross margin and gasoline and distillates gross margin, partially offset by increases in operating expense.  In May 2012, Speedway LLC acquired 87 convenience stores situated throughout Indiana and Ohio from GasAmerica Services, Inc. In July 2012, Speedway LLC acquired 10 convenience stores throughout northern Kentucky and southwestern Ohio from Road Ranger LLC in exchange for cash and a truck stop location in the Chicago metropolitan area. These acquisitions support our strategic initiative to increase Speedway segment sales volumes and complement our existing network of assets.  Our Pipeline Transportation segment generated income from operations of $50 million and $92 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to income from operations of $54 million and $105 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2011. The decreases primarily reflect reductions in income from pipeline affiliates due to reduced shipment volumes.  On February 1, 2012, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan, enabling us to purchase up to $2.0 billion of MPC common stock over a two-year period. On February 3, 2012, we entered into an $850 million ASR program with a major financial institution as part of this authorization. Under the ASR program, we received 17,581,344 shares of MPC common stock in the first quarter of 2012. On July 25, 2012, an additional 2,776,036 shares were delivered to us, for a total of 20,357,380 repurchased shares, which concluded the ASR program. Upon final settlement, the average per share amount paid for all shares purchased under the ASR program was $41.75. After the effects of our ASR program, $1.15 billion of the $2.0 billion amount authorized by our board of directors was available for share repurchases at June 30, 2012.  On July 2, 2012, MPLX, a wholly owned subsidiary of MPC, filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing was made in anticipation of a proposed initial public offering of common units representing limited interests in MPLX. The number of common units to be offered and the price range for the offering have not been determined. MPLX was formed by MPC to own, operate, develop and acquire crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products pipelines and other midstream assets. Headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, MPLX’s initial assets are expected to consist of a 51 percent interest in a network of common carrier crude oil and products pipeline assets located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions and a 100 percent interest in a butane cavern in West Virginia. As of the date of this report, the registration statement is not effective. The completion of the offering is subject to numerous conditions, including market conditions, and we can provide no assurance that it will be successfully completed.    28    Table of Contents The collective bargaining agreement for the hourly workers at our Catlettsburg refinery expired in January 2012. The agreement was temporarily extended while negotiations continued on a new collective bargaining agreement. When we were unable to reach agreement with the union, we declared impasse in the negotiations and implemented our last, best and final offer in late April 2012. We are in the process of working to resolve unfair labor practice charges the union has filed with the National Labor Relations Board. While no work stoppage has occurred, we have an increased risk of a temporary work stoppage at this location until such time as a new contract is ratified.  The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, the share repurchase plan, the proposed initial public offering of common units representing limited interests in MPLX and labor relations at the Catlettsburg refinery. Factors that could affect the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project include, but are not limited to, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity, and the market price of our common stock. Factors that could affect the proposed initial public offering of common units representing limited interests in MPLX include, but are not limited to, risks relating to securities markets generally, the impact of adverse market conditions affecting our midstream business, adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters and other risks. Factors that could affect labor relations at the Catlettsburg refinery include, but are not limited to, risks related to labor matters generally and our ability to obtain a signed agreement with the union. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Overview of Segments  Refining & Marketing  Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.  Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent sulfur residual fuel) are used for these crack spread calculations.  Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads which are calculated by reference to light sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.  Historically, WTI has traded at prices similar to LLS. In the second quarter and first six months of 2012 and 2011, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our Refining & Marketing gross margin.  The following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions:             (In millions, after-tax)         LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity (a) (per $1.00/barrel change)    $ 300     Sweet/sour differential sensitivity (b) (per $1.00/barrel change)     150     LLS-WTI spread sensitivity (c) (per $1.00 /barrel change)     65        (a)   Weighted 52% Chicago and 48% USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.    (b)   LLS (prompt)—[delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].    (c)   Assumes 25% of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.    29    Table of Contents In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:        •    the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;        •    the selling prices realized for refined products;        •    the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to manage price risk;        •    the cost of products purchased for resale; and        •    changes in manufacturing costs, which include depreciation and amortization.  Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery, and we charge the related costs to expense when they are incurred. We had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Garyville, Louisiana and Robinson, Illinois refineries during the first six months of 2012. During the first six months of 2011, significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities occurred at our Canton, Ohio refinery.  Speedway  Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation and consumer excise taxes, and the cost of bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillates demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillates generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile.  Pipeline Transportation  The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common-carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillates peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.    30    Table of Contents Results of Operations  Consolidated Results of Operations                                    Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,     (In millions)   2012     2011     Variance     2012     2011     Variance     Revenues and other income:                                 Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)   $ 20,240     $ 20,732     $ (492 )    $ 40,504     $ 38,551     $ 1,953     Sales to related parties     3       28       (25 )      4       51       (47 )    Income from equity method investments     9       17       (8 )      11       26       (15 )    Net gain on disposal of assets     1       4       (3 )      3       5       (2 )    Other income     4       13       (9 )      10       32       (22 )                                                                  Total revenues and other income     20,257       20,794       (537 )      40,532       38,665       1,867                                                                   Costs and expenses:                                 Cost of revenues (excludes items below)     16,789       16,654       135       34,098       31,211       2,887     Purchases from related parties     57       981       (924 )      120       1,766       (1,646 )    Consumer excise taxes     1,428       1,269       159       2,808       2,478       330     Depreciation and amortization     236       218       18       466       434       32     Selling, general and administrative expenses     376       288       88       639       505       134     Other taxes     64       59       5       138       127       11                                                                   Total costs and expenses     18,950       19,469       (519 )      38,269       36,521       1,748                                                                   Income from operations     1,307       1,325       (18 )      2,263       2,144       119     Related party net interest and other financial income     —        18       (18 )      —        35       (35 )    Net interest and other financial income (costs)     (17 )      (10 )      (7 )      (39 )      (24 )      (15 )                                                                  Income before income taxes     1,290       1,333       (43 )      2,224       2,155       69     Provision for income taxes     476       531       (55 )      814       824       (10 )                                                                  Net income   $ 814     $ 802     $ 12     $ 1,410     $ 1,331     $ 79                                                                  Consolidated net income was $12 million and $79 million higher in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, primarily due to a higher Refining & Marketing gross margin, which increased to $11.13 and $9.76 per barrel in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 from $10.78 and $8.78 per barrel in the second quarter and first six months of 2011.  Total revenues and other income decreased $537 million in the second quarter and increased $1.87 billion in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, primarily due to changes in refined product selling prices.  Sales to related parties decreased $25 million in the second quarter and $47 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011 primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil sales volumes. The crude oil sales in 2011 were to Marathon Oil, which are not classified as related party sales in periods subsequent to the Spinoff.  Income from equity method investments decreased $8 million in the second quarter and $15 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, primarily due to $7 million and $12 million decreases in income from our investment in LOOP and $4 million and $5 million decreases in income from our ethanol investments. These impacts were partially offset in the second quarter of 2012 by a $3 million decrease in losses from our investment in Centennial. LOOP experienced reductions in shipment volumes in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. At June 30, 2012, Centennial was not shipping product; therefore, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial and concluded that no impairment was required.  Other income decreased $9 million in the second quarter and $22 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, primarily due to a decrease in income from transition services provided to the buyer of the Minnesota Assets and a decrease in dividends received from our investment in a pipeline company. The decrease for the first six months of 2012 was also due to a decrease in sales of Renewable Identification Numbers.    31    Table of Contents Cost of revenues increased $2.89 billion in the first six months of 2012 compared to the first six months of 2011. The increase in the first six months of 2012 was primarily due to higher acquisition costs of crude oil and refined products in the Refining & Marketing segment, which resulted from increased volumes. The increase in crude oil volumes was partially due to purchases from Marathon Oil not being classified as related party purchases in periods subsequent to the Spinoff. These impacts were partially offset by decreased acquisition costs of other charge and blendstocks, primarily due to decreased volumes. In the first six months of 2012, crude oil volumes were up 11 percent, refined product volumes were up 16 percent and other charge and blendstocks volumes were down 20 percent.  Purchases from related parties decreased $924 million in the second quarter and $1.65 billion in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011. The decreases were primarily due to purchases of crude oil from Marathon Oil after the Spinoff not being classified as related party transactions.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $88 million in the second quarter and $134 million first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011. Employee compensation and benefits expenses comprised $81 million and $110 million of the increases, which was primarily due to $83 million of pension settlement expenses that were recognized in the second quarter of 2012. Contract service expenses increased $19 million and $42 million primarily due to higher information technology costs associated with being a separate stand-alone company and higher refinery-related contract services. These impacts were partially offset by lower shared services costs and having no allocations from Marathon Oil subsequent to the Spinoff.  Related party net interest and other financial income decreased $18 million in the second quarter and $35 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, due to our short-term investments in PFD Preferred Stock being redeemed prior to the Spinoff. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment in PFD Preferred Stock.  Net interest and other financial costs increased $7 million in the second quarter and $15 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, primarily reflecting decreased foreign currency gains and increased bank service and other fees. We capitalized third-party interest of $36 million in the second quarter and $66 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to $28 million and $48 million in the same periods of 2011. The capitalized interest is primarily associated with the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project.  Provision for income taxes decreased $55 million in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011, primarily due to the $43 million decrease in income before income taxes and lower state income taxes. During the second quarter of 2011, state income tax legislative changes were enacted, primarily in Michigan, resulting in an increase in tax expense of $17 million. The effective income tax rate was 37 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 40 percent in the second quarter of 2011. The provision for income taxes for the second quarter of 2011, which was prior to the Spinoff, was computed as if we were a stand-alone company. See Note 10 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further details.

Our average refined product selling prices were $3.01 per gallon and $3.04 per gallon in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to $3.15 per gallon and $2.95 per gallon in the second quarter and first six months of 2011. The table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas.

Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 678 million gallons in the second quarter and 1.29 billion gallons in the first six months of 2012 compared to 660 million gallons in the second quarter and 1.27 billion gallons in the first six months of 2011.  Speedway segment revenues increased $50 million in the second quarter and $350 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, primarily due to higher gasoline and distillates sales, which increased $13 million and $271 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2012, and higher merchandise sales, which increased $33 million and $65 million in the same periods. The increase in gasoline and distillates sales in the second quarter was primarily due to higher sales volumes partially offset by lower selling prices while the increase in the first six months of 2012 was primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher selling prices. Our gasoline and distillates sales volumes increased 31 million gallons and 44 million gallons in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. Our gasoline and distillates selling prices averaged $3.62 per gallon and $3.57 per gallon in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to $3.76 per gallon and $3.49 per gallon in the second quarter and first six months of 2011.

(c)   Blended Chicago/USGC crack spread is 52%/48% in 2012 and 53%/47% in 2011 based on MPC’s refining capacity by region in each period.    (d)   LLS (prompt)—[delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].  Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $65 million in the second quarter and $206 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, primarily due to a higher Refining & Marketing gross margin per barrel, which averaged $11.13 per barrel in the second quarter and $9.76 per barrel in the first six months of 2012 compared to $10.78 per barrel in the second quarter and $8.78 per barrel in the first six months of 2011. Our realized Refining & Marketing gross margin for the second quarter and first six months of 2012 improved from the same periods of 2011 primarily due to larger Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spreads. The increase in the first six months of 2012 was also due to wider differentials between WTI and other light sweet crudes such as LLS and an increase in WTI-priced crude oil volumes. The blended crack spread increased $2.93 per barrel and $2.46 per barrel in the second quarter and first six months of 2012, and we estimate this had positive impacts on our Refining & Marketing gross margin of $341 million and $590 million, respectively. The discount of WTI to LLS increased $1.15 per barrel in the first six months of 2012 as a result of logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets. We estimate this had a $207 million positive impact on our Refining & Marketing gross margin in the first six months of 2012.  For the second quarter 2012, the positive impacts on the Refining & Marketing gross margin were partially offset by a narrower sweet/sour differential, a reduced contango market structure and other unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs, as well as higher direct operating costs, primarily associated with higher planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses at our Robinson, Illinois refinery. For the first six months 2012, the positive impacts on the Refining & Marketing gross margin were partially offset by a decrease in the volume of sour crude oil processed, a reduced contango market structure and other unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs.  Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 54 percent and 50 percent of our crude oil processed in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to 54 percent in each of the same periods of 2011.  The 1,208 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) of crude oil refined in the second quarter and 1,177 mbpd in the first six months of 2012 was higher than the 1,196 mbpd in the second quarter and 1,155 mbpd in the first six months of 2011. Other charge and blendstocks throughput decreased 45 mbpd and 39 mbpd in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011, primarily due to a combination of increased crude oil throughput and operational economics at our Garyville, Louisiana refinery.    34    Table of Contents The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment:                             Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,        2012     2011     2012     2011     Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel) (a)   $ 11.13     $ 10.78     $ 9.76     $ 8.78     Direct operating costs in Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel): (b)                       Planned turnaround and major maintenance   $ 0.88     $ 0.65     $ 0.96     $ 0.94     Depreciation and amortization     1.39       1.26       1.39       1.29     Other manufacturing (c)     3.05       2.94       3.11       3.23                                               Total   $ 5.32     $ 4.85     $ 5.46     $ 5.46                                               Refined product sales volumes (thousands of barrels per day) (d)     1,571       1,561       1,551       1,551        (a)   Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization, divided by Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes.

Speedway segment income from operations increased $27 million in the second quarter and $44 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, primarily due to increases in merchandise gross margin and gasoline and distillates gross margin, partially offset by increases in operating expense attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores. Merchandise gross margin was $203 million in the second quarter and $382 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to $178 million in the second quarter and $336 million in the first six months of 2011. The increases in the merchandise gross margin were primarily due to margin expansion resulting from higher merchandise and food sales system wide. Same-store merchandise sales increased 2.2 percent and 2.1 percent in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011.  Speedway’s gasoline and distillates gross margin per gallon averaged 16.39 cents in the second quarter and 13.77 cents in the first six months of 2012, compared with 15.02 cents in the second quarter and 12.88 cents in the first six months of 2011. Same-store gasoline sales volume increased 2.1 percent and 0.5 percent in the second quarter and first six months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. The primary factor affecting higher same-store gasoline sales volume in the second quarter of 2012 was the lower average retail price of gasoline.  Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations decreased $4 million in the second quarter and $13 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011. The decrease primarily reflects a reduction in income from pipeline affiliates due to reduced shipment volumes.  Corporate and other unallocated expenses increased $23 million in the second quarter and $35 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2011, primarily due to our administrative units realizing the impact of being a stand-alone company in 2012 compared to expenses incurred prior to the June 30, 2011 Spinoff.  During the second quarter of 2012, we recorded pretax cumulative pension settlement expenses of $83 million resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions occurring in 2012. We anticipate recording additional pension settlement expenses of approximately $25 million in the third quarter 2012 based on lump sum distributions to be made during the quarter. However, this expected increase in pension expenses will be partially offset by an approximately $19 million reduction in pension expenses in the third quarter of 2012 associated with pension plan amendments made in the second quarter of 2012. See Note 18 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the pension plan amendments.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash Flows  Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.90 billion at June 30, 2012 compared to $3.08 billion at December 31, 2011. The change in cash and cash equivalents was due to the factors discussed below.  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $616 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to $952 million in the first six months of 2011. The $336 million decrease was primarily due to increases in working capital, partially offset by    35    Table of Contents  higher noncash income adjustments. Changes in working capital were a net $1.86 billion use of cash in the first six months of 2012 compared to a net $882 million use of cash in the first six months of 2011. The $1.86 billion use of cash in the first six months of 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from decreases in crude oil payable volumes and prices, and an increase in inventories resulting primarily from increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was a decrease in accounts receivable primarily caused by lower crude oil receivable volumes and prices. The $882 million use of cash in the first six months of 2011 was primarily due to the impact of increased crude oil and refined product prices on accounts receivable, the impact of decreased crude oil volumes on accounts payable and the impact of increased crude oil and refined product inventory volumes, partially offset by the impact of increased crude oil prices on accounts payable.  Net cash used in investing activities totaled $798 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $1.94 billion in the first six months of 2011. The $2.74 billion change was primarily due to net redemptions of related party debt securities in the first six months of 2011.  Net investments in related party debt securities was a source of cash of $2.40 billion in the first six months of 2011. All such activity reflected the net cash flow from redemptions and purchases of PFD Preferred Stock. Prior to the Spinoff, all investments in PFD Preferred Stock were redeemed, and the agreement with PFD was terminated. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in PFD Preferred Stock.  The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash.

(b)   Includes capitalized interest of $66 million and $58 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project comprised 60 percent and 61 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in the first six months of 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Cash used in acquisitions increased $89 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the first six months of 2011, primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores acquired by Speedway LLC, which acquired 87 convenience stores in May 2012 and 23 convenience stores in May 2011.  Cash provided by asset disposals decreased $127 million in the first six months of 2012 compared to the first six months of 2011, primarily due to the collection of a receivable in the first six months of 2011 related to the sale of our Minnesota Assets in December 2010.    36    Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.00 billion in the first six months of 2012 and $1.39 billion in the first six months of 2011. The net use of cash in the first six months of 2012 was primarily due to the common stock repurchases under our ASR program and dividend payments. The net use of cash in the first six months of 2011 was primarily due to the net repayment of debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries and net distributions to Marathon Oil, partially offset by cash provided by the issuance of long-term debt. These activities were undertaken to effect the Spinoff. See Note 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on our long-term debt.  Net borrowings and repayments under our long-term debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries was a use of cash of $3.62 billion in the first six months of 2011. The agreements with Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries were terminated in 2011. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these financing agreements.  Distributions to Marathon Oil totaled $699 million in the first six months of 2011, primarily related to net cash distributions paid to Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff, partially offset by income taxes it incurred on our behalf.  Derivative Instruments  See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.  Capital Resources  As of June 30, 2012, our liquidity totaled $4.90 billion consisting of:             (In millions)   June 30,2012     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 1,895     Revolving credit agreement     2,000     Trade receivables securitization facility     1,000                 Total   $ 4,895                At June 30, 2012, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreement or our trade receivables securitization facility.  Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.  Our revolving credit agreement, as amended and effective July 1, 2011 (the “Credit Agreement”), contains covenants that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a maximum ratio of Net Consolidated Indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for each consecutive four fiscal quarter period of 3.0 to 1.0 and a minimum ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for each consecutive four fiscal quarter period of 3.5 to 1.0. As of June 30, 2012, we were in compliance with these debt covenants with a ratio of Net Consolidated Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 0.6 to 1.0 and a ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 79.1 to 1.0.  As of June 30, 2012, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows:           Rating Agency     Rating    Moody’s   Baa2 (stable outlook)   Standard & Poor’s   BBB (stable outlook)  The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.    37    Table of Contents Neither our Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under our Credit Agreement and trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility.  Debt-to-Total-Capital Ratio  Our debt-to-total-capital ratio (total debt to total debt plus stockholders’ equity) was 24 percent at June 30, 2012 and 26 percent at December 31, 2011 as shown in the calculation below.

Approximately 25% of the 2012 budget is for continuation of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, which is expected to complete construction in the third quarter of 2012 with full integration into the refinery by year-end 2012. The budget also includes spending on other refining, transportation, logistics and marketing projects, spending for new construction and acquisitions to expand our Speedway segment, and amounts designated for corporate activities. There have been no material changes to our 2012 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital and investment budget and make changes as conditions warrant.  As of June 30, 2012, we plan to make additional contributions of approximately $125 million to our funded pension plans in 2012.  On July 25, 2012, our board of directors approved a 35 cents per share dividend, payable September 10, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 16, 2012.  On February 1, 2012, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan, enabling us to purchase up to $2.0 billion of MPC common stock over a two-year period. We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, ASRs or open market solicitations for shares. On February 3, 2012, we entered into an $850 million ASR program with a major financial institution as part of this authorization. Under the ASR program, we received 17,581,344 shares of MPC common stock in the first quarter of 2012. On July 25, 2012, an additional 2,776,036 shares were delivered to us, for a total of 20,357,380 repurchased shares, which concluded the ASR program. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR program was based on the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the repurchase period, subject to provisions that set a minimum and maximum number of shares. Upon final settlement, the average per share amount paid for all shares purchased under the ASR program was $41.75. The ASR program is accounted for as treasury stock purchase transactions, reducing the weighted average number of basic and diluted common shares outstanding by the shares repurchased, and as a forward contracts indexed to our common stock. After the effects of our ASR program, $1.15 billion of the $2.0 billion amount authorized by our board of directors was available for share repurchases at June 30, 2012. The timing of repurchases, if any, outside of the ASR program will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.    38    Table of Contents The above discussion includes forward-looking statements with respect to the share repurchase plan. Factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity, and the market price of our common stock.  Contractual Cash Obligations  As of June 30, 2012, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. There were no material changes to these obligations since December 31, 2011 outside the ordinary course of business.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.  We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with the Spinoff, we entered into arrangements with Marathon Oil providing various indemnities and guarantees. These arrangements are described in Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include, but are not limited to, our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.  Transactions with Related Parties  Following completion of the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in us and is no longer a related party.  For the six months ended June 30, 2011, purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil accounted for five percent or less of the combined total of cost of revenues and purchases from related parties. Related party purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil were at market-based contract prices. The crude oil prices were based on indices that represented market value for time and place of delivery and that were also used in third-party contracts. The natural gas prices equaled the price at which Marathon Oil purchased the natural gas from third parties plus the cost of transportation.  We believe that transactions with related parties, other than certain transactions with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and related to the provision of administrative services, were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.  On May 25, 2011, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and to provide a framework for our relationship with Marathon Oil. Because the terms of our separation from Marathon Oil and these agreements were entered into in the context of a related party transaction, the terms may not be comparable to terms that would be obtained in a transaction between unaffiliated parties.    39    Table of Contents Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs  We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.  There have been no significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the six months ended June 30, 2012.  Critical Accounting Estimates  There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the six months ended June 30, 2012.  Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which gives an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, through the qualitative assessment, an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, the quantitative impairment test must then be performed. The accounting standards update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this accounting standards update is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  In December 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires disclosure of additional information related to recognized financial and derivative instruments that are offset or are not offset but are subject to an enforceable netting agreement. The purpose of the requirement is to help users evaluate the effect or potential effect of offsetting and related netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. The update is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods that begin on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods. Adoption of this update is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.    40    Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  See Notes 14 and 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. During the first quarter 2012, we terminated our interest rate swap agreements, which we had designated as fair value hedges.  Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of June 30, 2012 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.  We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after June 30, 2012 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.  Sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point shift in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2012 is provided in the following table.                 (In millions)   Fair Value     IncrementalChange inFair Value     Financial assets (liabilities)(a)             Long-term debt(b)   $ (3,359 ) (c)    $ (336 ) (d)       (a)  Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.    (b)  Excludes capital leases.    (c)  Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.    (d)   Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at June 30, 2012.  At June 30, 2012, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments. Therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value.    41    Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2012, the end of the period covered by this report.  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  During the quarter ended June 30, 2012, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    42    Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited)                             Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,     (In millions)   2012     2011     2012     2011     Income from Operations by segment                       Refining & Marketing   $ 1,325     $ 1,260     $ 2,268     $ 2,062     Speedway     107       80       157       113     Pipeline Transportation     50       54       92       105     Items not allocated to segments:                       Corporate and other unallocated items     (92 )      (69 )      (171 )      (136 )    Pension settlement expenses     (83 )      —        (83 )      —                                                Income from operations   $ 1,307     $ 1,325     $ 2,263     $ 2,144                                               Capital Expenditures and Investments(a)                       Refining & Marketing   $ 178     $ 220     $ 331     $ 376     Speedway (b)     187       97       198       102     Pipeline Transportation     60       24       98       38     Corporate and Other(c)     56       44       94       73                                               Total   $ 481     $ 385     $ 721     $ 589                                                  (a)   Capital expenditures include changes in capital accruals.

Legal Proceedings  We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal proceedings involving a variety of matters, including matters relating to environmental laws and regulations. Any specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.  Litigation  We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The resolution of some of these lawsuits and proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, be material. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these lawsuits and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Environmental Proceedings  As reported in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, in September 2011, Marathon Petroleum Company LP received an Enforcement Notice from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”) regarding a product release at a facility in Stockbridge, Michigan. In the Enforcement Notice, MDEQ alleges certain environmental violations involving Michigan’s water protection laws. In March 2012, the MDEQ issued a draft Administrative Consent Order to resolve these alleged violations. In August 2012, we tentatively agreed to pay a civil penalty of $186,000 and are working with the MDEQ to finalize the terms of the Administrative Consent Order.  We are involved in a number of other environmental enforcement proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Administrative Proceedings  As reported in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty and Proposed Compliance Order (“NOPV”) to our subsidiary Marathon Pipe Line LLC (“MPL”) on August 24, 2010 related to a March 10, 2009 incident at St. James, Louisiana. The NOPV included a proposed civil penalty of approximately $1 million. On April 30, 2012, we signed a Consent Agreement and Order to resolve this matter with PHMSA. The Consent Agreement and Order requires MPL to pay a civil penalty of $842,650 and to undertake and complete a Supplemental Safety and Environmental Project with a minimum cost of $305,000. The civil penalty of $842,650 was paid in May 2012.  Item 1A. Risk Factors  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    45    Table of Contents Item 2.
