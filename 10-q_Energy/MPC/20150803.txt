Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail marketing and pipeline transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,760 convenience stores in 22 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,500 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience merchandise in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. •Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX.27Table of Contents Executive SummaryResultsSelect results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions, except per share data) 2015 2014 2015 2014Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing$1,206 $1,260 $2,522 $1,622Speedway127 94 295 152Pipeline Transportation79 81 146 153Net income attributable to MPC$826 $855 $1,717 $1,054Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$1.51 $1.48 $3.14 $1.80Net income attributable to MPC was $826 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in the second quarter and $1.72 billion, or $3.14 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2015 compared to $855 million, or $1.48 per diluted share, and $1.05 billion, or $1.80 per diluted share, for the same periods of 2014.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $54 million in the second quarter and increased $900 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014. The decrease in the second quarter was primarily due to a $1.18 per barrel decrease in gross margin, resulting from less favorable product price realizations compared to the spot market reference prices and less favorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil. Results were also affected by a charge of $46 million to recognize estimated costs for compliance with the recently proposed renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015, particularly those for bio-mass based diesel and advanced biofuels. These decreases were almost completely offset by the favorable effects that market structure had on crude oil acquisition prices and lower direct operating costs. The higher year to date results were primarily due to higher U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) crack spreads and lower turnaround and other direct operating costs. Speedway segment income from operations increased $33 million in the second quarter and $143 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014. The increases in both periods were primarily the result of higher merchandise and light product margins and the addition of newly acquired locations, partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations decreased $2 million in the second quarter and $7 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, primarily due to lower equity affiliate income and increases in various operating expenses, partially offset by increases in pipeline transportation revenue reflecting higher crude and refined product throughput across the system.MPLX LPWe own a 71.5 percent interest in MPLX, including the two percent general partner interest. Effective March 1, 2014, we sold MPLX a 13 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings for $310 million. MPLX financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit agreement. On December 1, 2014, we sold and contributed interests in Pipe Line Holdings totaling 30.5 percent to MPLX for $600 million in cash and 2.9 million MPLX common units valued at $200 million. MPLX financed the sales portion of this transaction with $600 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.The following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during the first six months of 2015 and 2014.  Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions) 2015 2014Cash distributions received from MPLX:   General partner distributions, including incentive distribution rights$6 $1Limited partner distributions45 35Total$51 $3628Table of Contents The market value of the 19,980,619 MPLX common units and 36,951,515 MPLX subordinated units we owned at June 30, 2015 was $4.1 billion based on the June 30, 2015 closing unit price of $71.38. Over time, we believe there will be substantial value attributable to our general partnership interests.On July 21, 2015, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.4400 per unit, totaling $42 million. This distribution will be paid on August 14, 2015. MPC’s portion of this cash distribution is approximately $31 million. As a result, upon payment of the second-quarter distribution, the financial tests required for conversion of all of the MPLX subordinated units, which are owned by a subsidiary of MPC, will have been met. Accordingly, the subordinated units will convert into common units on a one-for-one basis effective Aug. 17, 2015, the first business day following the payment of the second quarter distribution.On July 11, 2015, MPLX and MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. (“MWE”) entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby MWE would become a wholly owned subsidiary of MPLX. Under the terms of the agreement, each common unit of MWE issued and outstanding will be converted into the right to receive 1.09 common units of MPLX representing limited partner interests in MPLX, plus a one-time cash payment to MWE unitholders. As of the close of trading on Friday, July 10, 2015, the implied total enterprise value for MWE was approximately $20 billion, including the assumption of debt of approximately $4.2 billion. MPC would contribute $675 million of cash to MPLX to fund the one-time cash payment. The transaction between MPLX and MWE, which is subject to approval by MWE unitholders and to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2015. Following completion of the transaction, we expect to continue to consolidate MPLX’s financial results.The combination of MWE and MPLX defers the need for the recently proposed sale of MPC's marine business to MPLX in 2015. As a result, that transaction has been indefinitely postponed.On February 12, 2015, MPLX completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of MPLX Senior Notes. See Note 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information.Acquisitions and InvestmentsOn September 30, 2014, we acquired from Hess all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40,000 barrels per day on Colonial Pipeline for $2.82 billion. We refer to these assets as “Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets” and substantially all of these assets are part of our Speedway segment. This acquisition significantly expands our Speedway presence from nine to 22 states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow higher-valued, stable cash flow businesses. This acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for an incremental 200 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) of assured sales from our refining system. The transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition.In July 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.’s SAX pipeline through our investment in Illinois Extension Pipeline. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we made contributions of $94 million to Illinois Extension Pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs for the SAX project. We have contributed $214 million since project inception. See Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information regarding our future contributions to the SAX pipeline project.In March 2014, we acquired from Chevron Raven Ridge Pipe Line Company an additional seven percent interest in Explorer for $77 million, bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent. Due to this increase in our ownership percentage, we now account for our investment in Explorer using the equity method of accounting and report Explorer as a related party. Explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Hammond, Indiana.Share Repurchases and DividendsSince January 1, 2012, we have repurchased a total of $6.89 billion of our common stock, leaving $1.11 billion available for repurchases as of June 30, 2015. On July 29, 2015, our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization expiring in July 2017, bringing the total share repurchase authorizations to $10.0 billion. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.On July 29, 2015, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.32 per share on common stock, a 28 percent increase in its quarterly dividend over the first quarter of 2015, after adjusting to reflect the two-for-one stock split that occurred in the second quarter. The dividend is payable September 10, 2015, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 19, 2015. 29Table of Contents LiquidityAs of June 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.88 billion, an unused $2.5 billion revolving credit agreement, and $1.2 billion of availability under our $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility based on eligible trade receivables. At June 30, 2015, MPLX had no borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under its $1 billion credit agreement. Employees New collective bargaining agreements for the hourly refinery workers at our Canton, Catlettsburg and Texas City refineries were ratified in March and April, 2015. The agreements for Canton and Catlettsburg are scheduled to expire on January 31, 2019, and the agreement for Texas City is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2019. The labor agreement for our Galveston Bay refinery was ratified on June 23, 2015 and will expire on January 31, 2019.Stock Split On April 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend, which was distributed on June 10, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2015. The total number of authorized common shares and common stock par value remained unchanged. All historical share and per share data included in this report has been retroactively restated on a post-split basis.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the impact of the acquisition of Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets, the proposed transaction between MPLX and MWE, the estimated construction costs and completion of the SAX pipeline project and the share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the impact of the acquisition of Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets include, but are not limited to, our ability to successfully integrate the acquired Hess retail operations and achieve the strategic and other expected objectives related to the acquisition. Factors that could affect the proposed transaction between MPLX and MWE include, but are not limited to, the ability of MPLX and MWE to complete the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timetable, the ability to obtain approval of the proposed transaction by the unitholders of MWE and satisfy other conditions to the closing of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement, the ability to obtain governmental approvals of the proposed transaction based on the proposed terms and schedule, and any conditions imposed on the combined company in connection with consummation of the proposed transaction. Factors that could affect the estimated construction costs, timing and completion of the SAX pipeline project, include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.30Table of Contents Refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like Brent crude. In recent years, domestic U.S. crude oils, such as West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) and LLS, traded at prices less than Brent due to the growth in U.S. crude oil production, logistical constraints and other market factors. These price discounts compared to Brent favorably impacted the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. During the first half of 2013, WTI traded at prices significantly less than Brent and LLS, which favorably impacted our Refining & Marketing gross margin. The differential between WTI and LLS significantly narrowed during the second half of 2013 with a further narrowing broadly continuing until late 2014. Since late 2014, LLS has seen volatile differentials to both WTI and Brent. The spread between domestic crude oils and Brent could narrow further if there is a change in existing U.S. energy policy regarding crude oil exports, or if low crude oil prices reduce U.S. crude oil production growth substantially. If either were to occur, it could reduce our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax)  LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)$450Sweet/sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)200LLS-WTI differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)100Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change)140(a) Weighted 38 percent Chicago and 62 percent USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.(b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].(c) Assumes 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;•our refinery yields;•the selling prices realized for refined products;•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; •the cost of products purchased for resale; •the potential impact of lower of cost or market adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices; and•the impact of liquidations of last in, first out (“LIFO”) inventory layers with costs significantly above current market prices.Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of our crude oil and refined product inventories is determined under the LIFO method. During periods of rapidly declining prices, the LIFO cost basis of our crude oil and refined product inventories may have to be written down to market value. During the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a permanent reduction in our refined product inventories for LIFO accounting purposes. The cost of these inventories was based on prices in early 2014, which were much higher than current prices. As a result, we recognized a pre-tax charge of approximately $30 million in connection with this LIFO inventory reduction.31Table of Contents Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Costs for planned turnaround, major maintenance and engineering projects are expensed in the period incurred. We had significantly less planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Galveston Bay, Texas and Robinson, Illinois refineries during the first six months of 2015 compared to same period in 2014. SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway’s gross margin. Speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items. Approximately two-thirds of Speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in the second quarter of 2015 which is consistent with the same period of 2014. For the first six months of 2015, approximately half of Speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales compared to two-thirds in the same period of 2014. This change is the result of higher light product gross margins during the first six months of 2015 and the effects of the recently acquired Hess convenience stores. Pipeline TransportationThe profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.32Table of Contents Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions) 2015 2014 Variance 2015 2014 VarianceRevenues and other income:           Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$20,537 $26,844 $(6,307) $37,728 $50,129 $(12,401)Income from equity method investments20 57 (37) 35 92 (57)Net gain (loss) on disposal of assets (1) 11 (12) 4 12 (8)Other income25 21 4 54 45 9Total revenues and other income20,581 26,933 (6,352) 37,821 50,278 (12,457)Costs and expenses:           Cost of revenues (excludes items below)16,366 23,096 (6,730) 29,410 43,636 (14,226)Purchases from related parties82 130 (48) 158 289 (131)Consumer excise taxes1,939 1,599 340 3,771 3,114 657Depreciation and amortization362 325 37 725 645 80Selling, general and administrative expenses393 316 77 751 662 89Other taxes104 98 6 201 202 (1)Total costs and expenses19,246 25,564 (6,318) 35,016 48,548 (13,532)Income from operations1,335 1,369 (34) 2,805 1,730 1,075Net interest and other financial income (costs)(64) (48) (16) (145) (94) (51)Income before income taxes1,271 1,321 (50) 2,660 1,636 1,024Provision for income taxes432 457 (25) 918 565 353Net income839 864 (25) 1,742 1,071 671Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests13 9 4 25 17 8Net income attributable to MPC$826 $855 $(29) $1,717 $1,054 $663Net income attributable to MPC decreased $29 million in the second quarter and increased $663 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations, which decreased $54 million in the second quarter and increased $900 million in the first six months compared to the same periods of 2014. Additionally, our Speedway segment income increased $33 million in the second quarter and $143 million in the first six months. The decrease for the Refining & Marketing segment in the second quarter was primarily due to a $1.18 per barrel decrease in gross margin, resulting from less favorable product price realizations compared to the spot market reference prices and less favorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil. Results were also affected by a charge of $46 million to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance with the recently proposed renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015, particularly those for bio-mass based diesel and advanced biofuels. These decreases were almost completely offset by the favorable effects that market structure had on crude oil acquisition prices and lower direct operating costs. The year to date increase was primarily due to higher USGC crack spreads and lower turnaround and other direct operating costs. The increases in Speedway segment income for both periods were primarily the result of higher merchandise and light product margins and the addition of newly acquired locations, partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses.Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $6.31 billion in the second quarter and $12.40 billion in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014. The decreases were primarily due to lower refined product sales prices partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes. For the second quarter and first six months of 2015, average refined product sales prices decreased $1.00 per gallon and $1.07 per gallon, respectively, and refined product sales volumes increased 184 mbpd and 233 mbpd, respectively.33Table of Contents Income from equity method investments decreased $37 million in the second quarter and $57 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, primarily due to decreases in income from our ethanol affiliates of $27 million and $45 million, respectively, and decreases in income from LOOP of $11 million for both periods. The decreased results from our ethanol affiliates was mainly due to lower ethanol prices.Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $12 million in the second quarter and $8 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, primarily due to the sale of two terminals in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the sale of one terminal in the first quarter of 2015.Other income increased $4 million in the second quarter and $9 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, primarily due to an $11 million impairment of an investment in a company accounted for using the cost method in the second quarter of 2014, offset by gains on the sales of excess Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) in the second quarter and first six months of 2015. Cost of revenues decreased $6.73 billion in the second quarter and $14.23 billion in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014. The decreases were primarily due to:•decreases in refined product cost of sales of $6.92 billion and $14.32 billion, respectively, primarily due to decreases in raw material costs, partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes; and •decreases in refinery direct operating costs, including costs associated with significant planned turnaround activity, of $131 million, or $1.17 per barrel of total refinery throughput, and $633 million, or $2.58 per barrel of total refinery throughput, respectively. Purchases from related parties decreased $48 million in the second quarter and $131 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, primarily due to:•decreases in prices and volumes for ethanol purchases from TAME, TACE, and TAAE of $51 million for the second quarter and $79 million in the first six months of 2015; and •increase in volume purchased from LOOP and Centennial of $3 million in the second quarter and a decrease of $46 million in the first six months of 2015.Depreciation and amortization increased $37 million in the second quarter and $80 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, primarily due to depreciation of the assets acquired from Hess by our Speedway segment and projects placed into service in the Refining & Marketing segment.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $77 million in the second quarter and $89 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014 primarily due to increases in employee benefit costs, contract services and additional expenses related to the convenience stores acquired from Hess. These increases in the first six months were partially offset by decreased pension settlement expenses of $67 million.Other taxes increased $6 million in the second quarter and decreased $1 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014. In the second quarter and first six months of 2015, property taxes increased, primarily attributable the Hess convenience stores acquired in September 2014, partially offset by decreases in sales and use taxes resulting from decreased maintenance work at various refineries. In the first six months, this net increase was offset by tax credits received in the first quarter of 2015. Net interest and other financial costs increased $16 million in the second quarter and $51 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014 primarily due to increased borrowings on the MPC senior notes, MPLX revolver and the MPLX and MPC term loans. The MPC senior notes and term loan were used to fund the acquired Hess convenience stores in September 2014 and the MPLX revolver and term loans were used to fund its acquisitions of additional interest in Pipeline Holdings.Provision for income taxes decreased $25 million in the second quarter and increased $353 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, primarily due to a decrease of $50 million in income before income taxes in the second quarter and an increase of $1.02 billion in income before taxes for the first six months. The effective tax rates for the second quarter of both 2015 and 2014 are equivalent to or slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. 34Table of Contents Segment ResultsRevenuesRevenues, including intersegment sales, are summarized by segment in the following table.

The increases in intersegment refined product sales volumes were primarily due to the acquisition of convenience stores from Hess, partially offset by lower refined product sales prices. The table below shows our Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment.

The increases in gasoline and distillate sales were primarily due to volume increases of 708 million gallons and 1.37 billion gallons, respectively, primarily due to increases in the number of convenience stores resulting from the acquisition of convenience stores from Hess on September 30, 2014, partially offset by a decrease in average gasoline and distillate selling prices of $1.07 per gallon and $1.08 per gallon, respectively. The increase in merchandise sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores.The following table includes certain revenue statistics for the Speedway segment and includes results of the convenience stores acquired from Hess on September 30, 2014.

Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $54 million in the second quarter and increased $900 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014. The decrease in the second quarter was primarily due to a $1.18 per barrel decrease in gross margin, resulting from less favorable product price realizations compared to the spot market reference prices and less favorable crude oil acquisition costs relative to benchmark Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil. Results were also affected by a charge of $46 million to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance with the recently proposed renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015, particularly those for bio-mass based diesel and advanced biofuels. These decreases were almost completely offset by the favorable effects that market structure had on crude oil acquisition prices and lower direct operating costs. The year to date increase was primarily due to higher USGC crack spreads and lower turnaround and other direct operating costs. 37Table of Contents The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment’s business.

The spread decreased $0.60 per barrel for the first six months, however, volume increases offset the narrowing crack spread resulting in a positive impact on segment income of $37 million for the first six months.•The sweet/sour crude oil differential decreased by $1.47 per barrel for the second quarter and $1.30 per barrel for the first six months which had a negative impact on segment income of $88 million for the second quarter and $33 million for the first six months. In both periods, the narrowing differentials were partially offset by increased volumes.•The LLS-WTI crude oil differential increased $2.43 per barrel for the second quarter and $0.53 per barrel for the first six months had a positive impact on segment income of $93 million for the second quarter and $67 million for the first six months.The above market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, mix and crude costs as well as other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had estimated negative impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income of $458 million for the second quarter and $565 million for the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel)(a)$14.84 $16.02 $15.47 $15.28Refinery direct operating costs (dollars per barrel):(b)       Planned turnaround and major maintenance$0.66 $0.94 $0.73 $1.98Depreciation and amortization1.33 1.39 1.38 1.47Other manufacturing(c)3.94 4.77 4.08 5.32Total$5.93 $7.10 $6.19 $8.77(a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by total refinery throughputs.(b) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs.(c) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs.Refinery direct operating costs decreased $1.17 per barrel in the second quarter and $2.58 per barrel in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, reflecting decreases in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of $0.28 per barrel and $1.25 per barrel, respectively, and decreases in other manufacturing costs of $0.83 per barrel and $1.24 per barrel, respectively. The decreases in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs were primarily attributable to significant turnaround costs incurred by the Robinson refinery in the second quarter of 2014 and the Galveston Bay refinery in the first six months of 2014. The decreases in other manufacturing costs were primarily attributable to lower costs for energy, catalyst and routine maintenance. We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with purchased RINs increased to $75 million in the second quarter and $117 million in the first six months of 2015 from $22 million in the second quarter and $93 million in the first six months of 2014, primarily due to $46 million charge in the second quarter to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance with the recently proposed renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015, particularly those for bio-mass based diesel and advanced biofuels. For the first six months, this increase was partially offset by lower average costs of biodiesel RINs. The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment. Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014Gasoline & distillate gross margin (dollars per gallon)(a)$0.1351 $0.1282 $0.1652 $0.1220Merchandise gross margin (in millions)$359 $224 $670 $416Merchandise gross margin percent28.5% 27.1% 28.2% 26.8%(a) The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, divided by gasoline and distillate sales volume.Speedway segment income from operations increased $33 million in the second quarter and $143 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014. The increases in segment income were primarily due to increases in our merchandise gross margin of $135 million and $254 million, respectively, and increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $101 million, or $0.0069 per gallon, and $294 million, or $0.0432 per gallon, respectively, partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses. Merchandise, gasoline and distillate gross margins along with operating and administrative expenses were higher primarily due to the results of the acquired convenience stores from Hess. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations decreased $2 million in the second quarter and $7 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the same periods of 2014, primarily due to lower equity affiliate income and increases in various operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in pipeline transportation revenue reflecting higher crude and refined product throughput across the system.Corporate and other unallocated items increased $15 million in the second quarter of 2015, largely due to increased annual pension expense resulting from updates to actuarial estimates. In addition, for the first six months of 2015, the $28 million increase also reflected lower allocated employee benefit costs.39Table of Contents We recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $1 million in the second quarter and $2 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to $5 million in the second quarter and $69 million in the first six months of 2014 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during those periods.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.88 billion at June 30, 2015 compared to $1.49 billion at December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first six months of 2015 and 2014 are presented in the following table.

Changes in working capital were a net $292 million use of cash in the first six months of 2015 compared to a net $92 million use of cash in the first six months of 2014. The net $292 million use of cash in the first six months of 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventory. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt. Changes from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable decreased $436 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil prices.•Current receivables decreased $182 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil prices. •Inventories decreased $102 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to decreases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. The net $92 million use of cash from working capital changes in the first six months of 2014 was primarily due to increases in inventories and current receivables, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Changes from December 31, 2013 to June 30, 2014 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Inventories increased $932 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to an increase in crude oil inventory volumes. •Current receivables increased $166 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product prices, partially offset by lower outstanding refined product volumes. •Accounts payable increased $700 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher crude oil payable prices and volumes.Net cash used in investing activities was $175 million higher in the first six months of 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014, primarily due to an increase in additions to property, plant and equipment, partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions and investments in affiliates.The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows.40Table of Contents   Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions) 2015 2014Additions to property, plant and equipment per consolidated statements of cash flows$764 $569Non-cash additions to property, plant and equipment4 4Acquisitions— 27Asset retirement expenditures— 1Decrease in capital accruals(20) (31)Total capital expenditures748 570Investments in equity method investees149 164Total capital expenditures and investments$897 $734Capital expenditures and investments are summarized by segment below.

The increase in capital expenditures for our Speedway segment is primarily due to the conversion of convenience stores acquired from Hess in September 2014. The increase in capital expenditures for our Pipeline Transportation segment primarily reflects increased spending on the Robinson butane cavern, Patoka tank farm expansion and Cornerstone pipeline projects. Net cash used in equity method investments decreased $16 million for the first six months of 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of an additional seven percent interest in Explorer for $77 million and contributions to North Dakota Pipeline of $75 million to fund our portion of the Sandpiper pipeline project in the first six months of 2014, as compared to our contributions to Illinois Extension Pipeline of $94 million to fund the SAX pipeline project and $44 million to North Dakota Pipeline to fund our portion of the Sandpiper pipeline project in the first six months of 2015. Financing activities were a net $941 million use of cash in the first six months of 2015 compared to a net $1.13 billion use of cash in the first six months of 2014. The uses of cash for both periods included common stock repurchases under our share repurchase authorizations and dividend payments offset by sources of cash from net borrowing activity. In addition, in the first six months of 2015, uses of cash also included a significant portion of the contingent consideration payment to the seller of the Galveston Bay refinery.Long-term debt borrowings and repayments were a net $101 million source of cash in the first six months of 2015 compared to a net $244 million source of cash in the first six months of 2014. During the first six months of 2015, MPLX used proceeds from its $500 million of MPLX Senior Notes to repay $385 million outstanding under the MPLX Credit Agreement. During the first six months of 2014, MPLX borrowed $270 million under its revolving credit facility to fund MPLX’s acquisition of an additional interest in Pipe Line Holdings.41Table of Contents Cash used in common stock repurchases decreased $531 million in the first six months of 2015 compared to the first six months of 2014. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases for these periods. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase authorizations.

Our dividend payments were $0.50 per common share in the first six months of 2015 compared to $0.42 per common share in the first six months of 2014.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.Capital ResourcesOur liquidity totaled $5.58 billion at June 30, 2015 consisting of:  June 30, 2015(In millions) Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings AvailableCapacityRevolving credit agreement(a)$2,500 $— $2,500Trade receivables securitization facility(b)1,203 — 1,203Total$3,703 $— $3,703Cash and cash equivalents    1,881Total liquidity    $5,584(a) Excludes MPLX’s $1 billion revolving credit agreement, which had $1 billion available as of June 30, 2015.(b) Availability under our $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility is a function of eligible trade receivables, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products. As of July 31, 2015, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $906 million.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.The MPC term loan agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”), MPC Credit Agreement and MPLX Credit Agreement contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of June 30, 2015, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.30 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. As of June 30, 2015, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.1 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.42Table of Contents Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of June 30, 2015, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.Rating AgencyRatingMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook)FitchBBB (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.Neither the Term Loan Agreement, MPC Credit Agreement, MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the Term Loan Agreement, the MPC Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 35 percent at June 30, 2015 and 37 percent at December 31, 2014.(In millions)June 30, 2015 December 31, 2014Long-term debt due within one year$780 $27Long-term debt5,918 6,575Total debt$6,698 $6,602Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$6,698 $6,602Total equity12,290 11,390Total capital$18,988 $17,992Debt-to-total-capital ratio35% 37%Capital RequirementsWe have a capital and investment budget for 2015 of $2.53 billion, excluding capitalized interest. This budget also does not include the $675 million contribution to MPLX in connection with the pending merger with MWE. The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, our capital expenditures and investments were $881 million, excluding capitalized interest. There have been no material changes to our 2015 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.During 2014, we worked on a front-end engineering and design study and procured certain long lead time items for a residual fuel hydrocracker project at our Garyville refinery, with estimated total costs of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion, intended to increase margins by upgrading residual fuel to ULSD and gas oil. We are deferring a final investment decision on this project as we further evaluate the implications of current market conditions on the project. As of June 30, 2015, we have capitalized $136 million of costs associated with this project. If a decision is made to not pursue this project, there could be a future impairment of the costs incurred for the project.43Table of Contents Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we may be required to pay the seller a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In June 2015 and July 2014, we paid $189 million and $180 million for the first and second year’s contingent earnout, respectively. We currently estimate the fair value of the remaining payments to be $307 million. See Note 14 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the second quarter of 2015. At June 30, 2015, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If market conditions were to change and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of June 30, 2015, our equity investment in Centennial was $36 million and we had a $36 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial’s outstanding debt. See Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we did not make any contributions to our funded pension plans. While we have no required contributions, we may make additional contributions to our funded pension plans in 2015 depending on the anticipated funding status and plan asset performance.On July 29, 2015, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.32 per share on common stock, a 28 percent increase in its quarterly dividend over the first quarter of 2015, after adjusting to reflect the two-for-one stock split that occurred in the second quarter. The dividend is payable September 10, 2015, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 19, 2015. During the first six months of 2015, we paid $617 million to acquire 12 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $49.75 per delivered share. At June 30, 2015, we also had agreements to repurchase additional common shares for $9 million, which were settled in July 2015. As of June 30, 2015, we had $1.11 billion of remaining share repurchase authorization. On July 29, 2015, our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization expiring in July 2017. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.We may utilize various methods to effect additional share repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future share repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to a decision on the residual fuel hydrocracker project at our Garyville refinery, the contingent earnout payment to the seller of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment, future contributions to our funded pension plans and share repurchases. Forward-looking statements about our capital requirements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking statements regarding capital requirements include the availability of liquidity, business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets, market price of our common stock, prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Contractual Cash Obligations As of June 30, 2015, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first six months of 2015, our long-term debt commitments increased $154 million. The increase was due to the issuance of MPLX senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of the MPLX Credit Agreement. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.44Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million (“ppm”) beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards. There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the six months ended June 30, 2015.Critical Accounting EstimatesThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the six months ended June 30, 2015.Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted As discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future.45Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.See Notes 14 and 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of June 30, 2015 is provided in the following table.  Change in IFO from aHypothetical PriceIncrease of Change in IFO from aHypothetical PriceDecrease of(In millions) 10% 25% 10% 25%As of June 30, 2015       Crude$(70) $(174) $78 $199Refined products15 37 (15) (37)We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity. Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after June 30, 2015 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt, including the portion classified as current and excluding capital leases, as of June 30, 2015 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(In millions) Fair Value as of June 30, 2015(a) Change inFair Value(b) Change in Net Income for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015(c)Long-term debt     Fixed-rate$5,587  $556 n/aVariable-rate950 n/a 5(a) Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(b) Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at June 30, 2015.(c) Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2015. At June 30, 2015, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX term loan agreement. There were no borrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2015. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX Credit Agreement, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.46Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2015, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.47Table of Contents           Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions)2015 2014 2015 2014Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing$1,206 $1,260 $2,522 $1,622Speedway127 94 295 152Pipeline Transportation(a)79 81 146 153Items not allocated to segments:        Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(76) (61) (156) (128) Pension settlement expenses(1) (5) (2) (69)Income from operations$1,335 $1,369 $2,805 $1,730Capital Expenditures and Investments(b)       Refining & Marketing$207 $235 $436 $413Speedway100 44 145 76Pipeline Transportation157 64 238 194Corporate and Other(c)49 20 78 51Total$513 $363 $897 $734(a) Corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX are included in the Pipeline Transportation segment.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.LitigationIn July 2015, a purported class action lawsuit asserting claims challenging the proposed merger of MPLX and MWE was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by a purported unitholder of MWE. The lawsuit alleges that the individual members of the board of directors of MarkWest Energy GP, L.L.C. the general partner of MWE, breached their fiduciary and/or contractual duties to the unitholders of MWE and that MPLX, MPC and Sapphire Holdco LLC, a subsidiary of MPLX, aided and abetted those breaches. The complaint seeks to enjoin the proposed merger or, if the merger is consummated, to rescind the transaction or recover rescission damages. The lawsuit also seeks an accounting and recovery of attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, and other litigation costs. We believe the allegations in the complaint are without merit. In May 2015, the Kentucky attorney general filed a lawsuit against our wholly owned subsidiary, Marathon Petroleum Company LP (“MPCLP”) in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky asserting claims under federal and state antitrust statutes, the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, and state common law. The complaint, as amended in July 2015, alleges that MPCLP used deed restrictions, supply agreements with customers and exchange agreements with competitors to unreasonably restrain trade in areas within Kentucky and seeks declaratory relief, unspecified damages, civil penalties, restitution and disgorgement of profits. At this early stage, the ultimate outcome of this litigation remains uncertain, and neither the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome nor the ultimate liability, if any, can be determined, and we are unable to estimate a reasonably possible loss (or range of loss) for this matter. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter.We are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Environmental ProceedingsAs reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, in January 2011, the EPA notified us of alleged violations of various statutory and regulatory provisions related to motor fuels, some of which we had previously self-reported to the EPA. Subsequently, we self-reported four additional alleged Clean Air Act violations related to motor fuels to the EPA. In July 2014, we tentatively agreed to pay a $2.75 million civil penalty as well as undertake certain projects to reduce emissions and retire sulfur credits. In August and December 2014, we self-reported three similar alleged violations to the EPA. The EPA agreed to include these incidents in the consent decree and increased the civil penalty to $2.9 million. We finalized the consent decree with the agency in May 2015.We are involved in a number of other environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. 51Table of Contents Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
