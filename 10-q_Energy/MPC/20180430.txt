Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.CORPORATE OVERVIEWWe are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream services company. We currently own and operate six refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.9 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Northeast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services provided by our Midstream segment. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,740 convenience stores in 21 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established transportation fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,600 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 20 states and the District of Columbia.Through our ownership interest in MPLX, we own and operate significant midstream energy infrastructure assets. We are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the United States and the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets. Our midstream gathering and processing operations include: approximately 5.9 bcf/d of gathering capacity, 8.4 bcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 610 mbpd of NGL fractionation capacity. We also own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 10,800 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines, as well as refining logistics assets, including tanks, docks and loading racks located at our six refineries. We distribute our refined products through one of the largest terminal operations in the United States and one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. In addition, MPLX provides scheduling and marketing services (“fuels distribution services”) to our Refining & Marketing segment.Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our six refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services provided by our Midstream segment. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets. •Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience merchandise in retail markets in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. •Midstream – gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs; and transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for the Refining & Marketing segment via refining logistics assets, pipelines, terminals, towboats and barges. The Midstream segment primarily reflects the results of MPLX, our sponsored master limited partnership. Recent DevelopmentsOn April 29, 2018, MPC and Andeavor (“ANDV”) entered into a definitive merger agreement under which MPC will acquire all of ANDV’s outstanding shares, representing a total equity value of $23.3 billion and a total enterprise value of $35.6 billion 32Table of Contents based on MPC’s April 27, 2018, closing price of $81.43. Under the terms of the agreement, ANDV shareholders will have the option to choose 1.87 shares of MPC stock or $152.27 in cash subject to a proration mechanism that achieves an aggregate consideration mix of 85 percent equity and 15 percent cash. MPC and ANDV shareholders will own approximately 66 percent and 34 percent of the combined company, respectively. This anticipated transaction combines two strong, complementary companies to create a leading U.S. refining, marketing, and midstream company with an enterprise value of over $90 billion based on the closing share/unit price of MPC/MPLX and ANDV/ANDX on April 27, 2018. The proposed combination substantially increases MPC’s geographic diversification and scale and strengthens each of our operating segments by: diversifying our refining portfolio into attractive markets while also increasing access to advantaged feedstocks, enhancing our midstream footprint in the Permian basin, and creating a nationwide retail and marketing portfolio that is expected to substantially improve efficiencies and enhance our ability to serve customers. We expect the combination to generate approximately $1 billion in tangible annual run-rate cost and operating synergies within the first three years, significantly enhancing our long-term cash flow generation profile. In connection with this strategic combination, on April 30, 2018, we also announced that our board authorized an incremental $5 billion of share repurchases. Following the combination, we plan to continue our balanced approach to investing in the business and returning cash to our investors, while maintaining our commitment to an investment-grade credit profile.The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory and other customary closing conditions, including approvals from both MPC and ANDV shareholders. The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the proposed transaction between MPC and ANDV. Factors that could affect the proposed transaction between MPC and ANDV include, but are not limited to, the ability of MPC and ANDV to complete the proposed transaction on the anticipated terms and timetable; the ability to obtain shareholder and government approval; the ability to satisfy various other conditions to the closing of the proposed transaction; the risk that the cost savings and any other synergies from the proposed transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; disruption from the proposed transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; and risks relating to any unforeseen liabilities of ANDV. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied in the forward-looking statements regarding the benefits of the proposed transaction include: future levels of revenues, refining and marketing margins, operating costs, retail gasoline and distillate margins, merchandise margins, income from operations, net income or earnings per share; the regional, national and worldwide availability and pricing of refined products, crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and other feedstocks; consumer demand for refined products; our ability to manage disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit rating; future levels of capital, environmental or maintenance expenditures, general and administrative and other expenses; the success or timing of completion of ongoing or anticipated capital or maintenance projects; the reliability of processing units and other equipment; business strategies, growth opportunities and expected investment; MPC’s share repurchase authorizations, including the timing and amounts of any common stock repurchases; the adequacy of our capital resources and liquidity, including but not limited to, availability of sufficient cash flow to execute our business plan and to effect any share repurchases, including within the expected timeframe; the effect of restructuring or reorganization of business components; the potential effects of judicial or other proceedings on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; continued or further volatility in and/or degradation of general economic, market, industry or business conditions; compliance with federal and state environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations, including the cost of compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard, and/or enforcement actions initiated thereunder; the anticipated effects of actions of third parties such as competitors, activist investors or federal, foreign, state or local regulatory authorities or plaintiffs in litigation; and the impact of adverse market conditions or other similar risks to those identified herein affecting MPLX and ANDX.

Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Dec. 31, 2017.33Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARYResultsSelect results are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions, except per share data) 2018 2017Income (loss) from operations by segment   Refining & Marketing$(133) $(70)Speedway95 135Midstream567 309Items not allocated to segments(89) (83)Income from operations$440 $291Provision for income taxes$22 $41Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests$182 $55Net income attributable to MPC$37 $30Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$0.08 $0.06Net income attributable to MPC was $37 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $30 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Refining & Marketing segment loss from operations was $133 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with a loss from operations of $70 million in the same quarter of 2017. The decrease in segment results was primarily due to the February 1, 2018, dropdown of refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX. These businesses were reported in the Midstream segment prospectively from February 1, resulting in a net reduction of $181 million to Refining & Marketing segment results and a net increase to Midstream segment results of the same amount. No effect was given to prior periods as these entities were not considered businesses prior to February 1, 2018.The change in Refining & Marketing segment results also reflects the benefits of increased refinery throughputs, lower direct operating costs and the retroactive enactment of a biodiesel blending tax credit for 2017, offset by lower product price realizations as compared with spot market reference prices. Refinery throughputs totaled 1.9 million barrels per day in first quarter 2018, an increase of almost 12 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The USGC and Chicago LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $7.70 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $7.72 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017. Speedway segment income from operations decreased $40 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Speedway’s light product margin was 15.61 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 15.66 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in segment results was primarily due to higher operating expense, largely related to labor costs, and accelerated depreciation. The accelerated depreciation resulted from Speedway’s upgrade of dispenser technology to provide marketing earnings enhancements and strengthen customer bank card security in advance of the required timeframe. In addition, during the quarter, multiple storms in the Northeast and Midwest markets resulted in reduced traffic at Speedway stores. Midstream segment income from operations increased $258 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the February 1, 2018 dropdown discussed above and higher gathered, processed and fractionated volumes resulting from new processing facilities.Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $127 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to the February 1, 2018 dropdown, which increased MPLX net income, partially offset by the GP/IDR Exchange. MPLX noncontrolling interest ownership decreased to 36.4 percent at March 31, 2018 from 72.2 percent at March 31, 2017.MPLX LP As of March 31, 2018, we owned 63.6 percent of the outstanding MPLX common units and control MPLX through our ownership of the general partner interest in MPLX.34Table of Contents MPLX Highlights•On February 1, 2018, we completed the dropdown of the remaining identified assets related to our strategic actions to enhance shareholder value announced in January 2017. We contributed our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX in exchange for $4.1 billion in cash and approximately 114 million newly issued MPLX units. •Immediately following the dropdown, our IDRs were cancelled and our economic general partner interest was converted into a non-economic general partner interest, all in exchange for 275 million newly issued MPLX common units.•MPLX financed the cash portion of the February 1, 2018 dropdown with its $4.1 billion 364-day term loan facility, which was entered into on January 2, 2018. •On February 8, 2018, MPLX issued $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering. MPLX used $4.1 billion of the net proceeds of the offering to repay the 364-day term-loan facility. The remaining proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under MPLX’s revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with us and for general partnership purposes.•On September 1, 2017, we contributed our joint-interest ownership in certain pipelines and storage facilities to MPLX in exchange for $420 million in cash and approximately 19 million MPLX units.•On March 1, 2017, we contributed certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX in exchange for $1.5 billion in cash and approximately 13 million MPLX units.•On February 10, 2017, MPLX issued $2.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering. The net proceeds were used to fund the $1.5 billion cash portion of the consideration MPLX paid MPC for the dropdown of assets on March 1, 2017, as well as for general partnership purposes.Distributions from MPLXThe following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2018 2017Cash distributions received from MPLX:   General partner distributions, including IDRs$— $57Limited partner distributions171 45Total$171 $102We owned approximately 505 million MPLX common units at March 31, 2018 valued at $16.68 billion based on the March 29, 2018 closing unit price of $33.04. On April 25, 2018, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.6175 per common unit payable on May 15, 2018. As a result, MPLX will make distributions totaling $467 million to its common unitholders. MPC’s portion of these distributions, less an agreed waiver of approximately $24 million, is approximately $288 million. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.Acquisitions and InvestmentsOur acquisition and investment activity in 2017 was primarily focused on our Midstream segment as follows:•On March 1, 2017, MPLX purchased the Ozark pipeline from Enbridge Pipelines (Ozark) LLC for approximately $219 million. •On February 15, 2017, MPLX acquired a partial, indirect equity interest in the Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company Pipeline (“ETCOP”) projects, collectively referred to as the Bakken Pipeline system, through a joint venture with Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. (“Enbridge Energy Partners”). MPLX holds, through a subsidiary, a 25 percent interest in MarEn Bakken, which equates to an approximate 9.2 percent indirect equity interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. •Effective January 1, 2017, MarkWest, and Antero Midstream formed a joint venture, Sherwood Midstream, to support the development of Antero Resources Corporation’s Marcellus Shale acreage in West Virginia. MarkWest has a 50 percent ownership interest in Sherwood Midstream. In connection with this transaction, MarkWest contributed certain gas processing plants currently under construction at the Sherwood Complex with a fair value of approximately $134 million and cash of approximately $20 million and sold Class A Interests in MarkWest Ohio Fractionation to 35Table of Contents Sherwood Midstream for $126 million in cash. Sherwood Midstream Holdings, a joint venture with MarkWest and Sherwood Midstream, was also formed to own, operate and maintain certain assets owned by Sherwood Midstream and MarkWest. MarkWest contributed certain real property, equipment and facilities with a fair value of approximately $209 million to Sherwood Midstream Holdings in exchange for a 79 percent initial ownership interest. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, MarkWest Liberty Midstream sold to Sherwood Midstream 6 percent of their equity ownership in Sherwood Midstream Holdings for $15 million. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions and investments and Note 6 for additional information related to the investments in Sherwood Midstream, Ohio Fractionation and Sherwood Midstream Holdings. Share Repurchases During the quarter, we repurchased 19 million common shares at an average cost per share of $68.74 funded primarily by after tax proceeds from the February 1, 2018 dropdown. Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $13.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $11.14 billion of our common stock, leaving $1.86 billion available for repurchases. See Note 9 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.LiquidityAs of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.65 billion, excluding MPLX's cash and cash equivalents, $3.5 billion of unused bank revolving credit facilities and full availability under our $750 million trade receivables facility. As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2018, MPLX had cash and cash equivalents of $2 million and approximately $2.25 billion available through its bank revolving credit facility and $500 million available through its credit facility with MPC. Subsequent to quarter end, MPLX’s credit facility with MPC was amended to increase its capacity to $1 billion to allow additional flexibility to MPLX.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our business strategies and our share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect our business strategies include, but are not limited to, our ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic initiatives; the impact of adverse market conditions affecting MPC’s and MPLX’s midstream businesses; adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, our ability to generate sufficient income and cash flow to effect the intended share repurchases, including within the expected timeframe; our ability to manage disruption in credit markets or changes to our credit rating; business conditions; availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.OVERVIEW OF SEGMENTSRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ULSD and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing margin.Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.36Table of Contents The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax)  LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)$590Sweet/sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)300LLS-WTI differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)90Natural gas price sensitivity(d) (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change)200(a) Weighted 40 percent Chicago and 60 percent USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.(b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars] and assumes approximately 58 percent of crude throughput are sour based.(c) Assumes 17 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.(d) This is consumption based exposure for our Refining & Marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our Midstream segment.In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing margin is impacted by factors such as: •the selling prices realized for refined products;•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;•our refinery yields;•the cost of products purchased for resale; •the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;•the potential impact of LCM adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices; and•the minimum commitments under certain agreements with MPLX.Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Costs for planned turnaround, major maintenance and engineering projects are expensed in the period incurred. We have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with MPLX. Under these agreements, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, provides transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to our Refining & Marketing segment. Certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, refined products and butane. Certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets. SpeedwayOur retail marketing margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, transportation fuel prices, seasonal demand fluctuations, availability of wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway’s margin. Speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.37Table of Contents MidstreamNGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our Midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.Our Midstream segment transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for our Refining & Marketing segment. The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. The profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. The profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products. The profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our Refining & Marketing segment and our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our Refining & Marketing segment. As discussed above in the Refining & Marketing section, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, has various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements related to services provided to our Refining & Marketing segment. Under these agreements, MPLX has received various commitments of minimum throughput, storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport, store, distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. 38Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Financial Statements and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance. Consolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2018 2017 VarianceRevenues and other income:     Sales and other operating revenues(a)$18,694 $16,134 $2,560Sales to related parties172 154 $18Income from equity method investments86 57 29Net gain on disposal of assets2 5 (3)Other income30 43 (13)Total revenues and other income18,984 16,393 2,591Costs and expenses:     Cost of revenues (excludes items below)(a)17,370 14,946 2,424Purchases from related parties141 122 19Depreciation and amortization528 536 (8)Selling, general and administrative expenses402 390 12Other taxes103 108 (5)Total costs and expenses18,544 16,102 2,442Income from operations440 291 149Net interest and other financial costs183 149 34Income before income taxes257 142 115Provision for income taxes22 41 (19)Net income235 101 134Less net income attributable to:     Redeemable noncontrolling interest16 16 —Noncontrolling interests182 55 127Net income attributable to MPC$37 $30 $7(a) We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue - Revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606), as of Jan. 1, 2018, and elected to report certain taxes on a net basis. We applied the standard using the modified retrospective method and, therefore, comparative information continues to reflect certain taxes on a gross basis.Net income attributable to MPC increased $7 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to an increase in income from operations offset by an increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Sales and other operating revenues increased $2.56 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices, which increased $0.25 per gallon, and an increase in refined product sales volumes in the first quarter of 2018. These increases were partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under ASC 606 prospectively from January 1, 2018, which resulted in a decrease in revenues of $1.25 billion in the first quarter of 2018. See Notes 2 and 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.Sales to related parties increased $18 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, due to increased sales to PFJ Southeast, our travel center joint venture. 39Table of Contents Income from equity method investments increased $29 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to an increase in income from pipeline and gathering and processing affiliates. Other income decreased $13 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a decrease in RIN sales.Cost of revenues increased $2.42 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to:•an increase in refined product cost of sales of $3.37 billion, primarily due to higher raw material costs; and•a decrease in certain taxes of $1.25 billion in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under ASC 606 prospectively from January 1, 2018. For the first quarter of 2017, certain taxes continue to be presented on a gross basis and are included in cost of revenues. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on recently adopted accounting standards.Purchases from related parties increased $19 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, largely due to:•an increase in ethanol volumes purchased from TAME, TACE and TAAE of $6 million; and•an increase in crude oil volume purchased from LOOP of $4 million; and•an increase in transportation services provided by our marine joint ventures of $3 million.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to higher contract services and employee benefit costs. Net interest and other financial costs increased $34 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to increased MPLX borrowings. Provision for income taxes decreased $19 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate under the TCJA. The combined federal, state and foreign income tax rate was 9 percent and 29 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was less than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to certain permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, state and local deferred tax benefits primarily resulting from the February 1 dropdown and GP/IDR Exchange and equity compensation. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily certain permanent tax differences related to equity compensation, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest and the domestic manufacturing deduction offset by state and local tax expense.Segment ResultsNon-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP (“non-GAAP”). We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to its most comparable GAAP financial measure, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures we use are as follows:Refining & Marketing MarginRefining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes any LCM inventory market adjustment.Speedway Gasoline and Distillate MarginSpeedway gasoline and distillate margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees and excluding any LCM inventory market adjustment.Speedway Merchandise MarginSpeedway merchandise margin is defined as the price paid by consumers less the cost of merchandise.See the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures in the following segment discussions.40Table of Contents Refining & Marketing  Three Months Ended  March 31,Key Financial and Operating Data 2018 2017Refining & Marketing revenues (in millions)(a)$15,961 $13,963Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to Speedway (in millions)(a)$2,379 $2,590Refining & Marketing intersegment fees paid to Midstream (in millions)$631 $344Refining & Marketing income (loss) from operations (in millions) $(133) $(70)Refined product sales volumes (thousands of barrels per day)(b)2,261 2,070Refined product intersegment sales volumes to Speedway (millions of gallons)1,332 1,336Refined product sales destined for export (thousands of barrels per day)265 226Average refined product sales prices (dollars per gallon)(c)$1.93 $1.68Average refined product intersegment sales prices to Speedway (dollars per gallon)(c)$2.19 $1.93Refinery throughputs (thousands of barrels per day):   Crude oil refined 1,745 1,511Other charge and blendstocks 160 197Total 1,905 1,708Sour crude oil throughput percent 52 67WTI-priced crude oil throughput percent26 15Refining & Marketing margin (dollars per barrel)(d)$10.58 $11.65Refinery direct operating costs (dollars per barrel):(e)   Planned turnaround and major maintenance$2.22 $3.10Depreciation and amortization 1.37 1.63Other manufacturing(e) 4.09 4.72Total $7.68 $9.45(a) We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue - Revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606), as of January 1, 2018, and elected to report certain taxes on a net basis.

The increase was primarily due to increases in refined product sales prices and refined product sales volumes in the first quarter of 2018. These increases were partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under ASC 606 prospectively from January 1, 2018, which resulted in a decrease in Refining & Marketing segment revenues of $1.06 billion in the first quarter of 2018. See Notes 2 and 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment decreased $211 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. An increase in refined product sales prices to Speedway of $0.26 per gallon was more than offset by our election to present revenues net of consumer excise taxes under ASC 606 prospectively from January 1, 2018. See Notes 2 and 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.Refining & Marketing intersegment fees paid to our Midstream segment increased $287 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the February 1, 2018 dropdown of fuels distribution and refining logistics services. These charges do not impact Refining & Marketing margin but reduce Refining & Marketing segment results with a corresponding increase to Midstream segment results. 42Table of Contents Refining & Marketing segment loss from operations was $133 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with a loss from operations of $70 million in the same quarter of 2017. The decrease in segment results was primarily due to the February 1, 2018, dropdown of refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX. These businesses were reported in the Midstream segment prospectively from February 1, resulting in a net reduction of $181 million to Refining & Marketing segment results and a net increase to Midstream segment results of the same amount. No effect was given to prior periods as these entities were not considered businesses prior to February 1, 2018. The change in segment results also reflects a benefit related to the retroactive enactment of a biodiesel blending tax credit for 2017. Based on the changes in the market indicators shown above, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales, we estimate a positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of $189 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including the effects of product price realizations, the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had an estimated negative impact on Refining & Marketing segment income of $166 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Crude oil throughputs increased 234 mbpd in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Refinery throughputs totaled 1.9 million barrels per day in first quarter of 2018, an increase of almost 12 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the first quarter of 2018 is primarily due to decreased turnaround activity at our Garyville refinery in the first quarter of 2018 in addition to operational efficiencies resulting from turnaround activity performed in the first quarter of 2017 at our Galveston Bay and Catlettsburg refineries. Refinery direct operating costs decreased $1.77 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to a decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance of $0.88 per barrel, largely attributable to lower turnaround costs incurred by the Garyville refinery. Other manufacturing costs and depreciation and amortization decreased $0.63 per barrel and $0.26 per barrel, respectively, primarily as a result of the dropdown of refining logistics assets to MPLX on February 1, 2018. Subsequent to February 1, 2018, these costs are reported in the Midstream segment. Higher crude throughputs during the first quarter of 2018 also reduced refinery direct operating costs per barrel.We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with RINs decreased to $89 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $97 million in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a decrease in RINs prices, partially offset by an increase in RINs purchased.Speedway  Three Months Ended  March 31,Key Financial and Operating Data  2018 2017Speedway revenues (in millions)(a) $4,572 $4,384Speedway income from operations (in millions)$95 $135Convenience stores at period-end 2,742 2,731Gasoline & distillate sales (millions of gallons)1,393 1,393Average gasoline & distillate sales prices (dollars per gallon)$2.52 $2.25Gasoline and distillate margin (dollars per gallon)(b)$0.1561 $0.1566Merchandise sales (in millions)(a) $1,129 $1,127Merchandise margin (in millions)(c)$319 $320Merchandise margin percent28.3% 28.4%Same store gasoline sales volume (period over period)(1.5%) (1.0%)Same store merchandise sales (period over period)(d)2.3% 2.1%(a) We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue - Revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606), as of Jan. 1, 2018, and elected to report certain taxes on a net basis.

The increase in revenues in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in gasoline and distillate sales of $374 million resulting from a $0.27 per gallon increase in average gasoline and distillate sales prices, partially offset by our election to present revenues net of certain taxes under ASC 606 prospectively from January 1, 2018, which resulted in a decrease in Speedway segment revenues of $193 million in the first quarter of 2018. See Notes 2 and 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.Speedway segment income from operations decreased $40 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Speedway’s light product margin was 15.61 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 15.66 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in segment results was primarily due to higher operating expense, largely related to labor costs, and accelerated depreciation. The accelerated depreciation resulted from Speedway’s upgrade of dispenser technology to provide marketing earnings enhancements and strengthen customer bank card security in advance of the required timeframe. In addition, during the quarter, multiple storms in the Northeast and Midwest markets resulted in reduced traffic at Speedway stores. 44Table of Contents Midstream  Three Months Ended  March 31,Key Financial and Operating Data  2018 2017Midstream third party revenues (in millions)(a)$713 $532Midstream intersegment sales to Refining & Marketing (in millions)631 344 Total Midstream revenues (in millions)$1,344 $876Midstream income from operations (in millions)567 309Crude oil and refined product pipeline throughputs (mbpd)(b)3,459 2,888Average crude oil and refined products tariff rates (dollars per barrel)(c)$0.59 $0.65Terminal throughput (mbpd)1,445 1,424Gathering system throughput (MMcf/d)4,171 3,184Natural gas processed (MMcf/d)6,629 6,132C2 (ethane) + NGLs (natural gas liquids) fractionated (mbpd)423 367     Benchmark Prices    Natural Gas NYMEX HH ($ per MMBtu)$2.85 $3.06C2 + NGL Pricing ($ per gallon)(d)$0.73 $0.64(a) We adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue - Revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606), as of Jan. 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method.

Refining logistics contains the integrated tank farm assets that support MPC’s refining operations. These logistics assets include: 619 tanks, with approximately 56 million barrels of storage capacity (for crude, finished products and intermediates), 32 rail and truck racks and 18 docks. Fuels distribution is structured to provide a broad range of scheduling and marketing services as MPC’s sole and exclusive agent. These new businesses were reported in the Midstream segment prospectively from February 1, 2018, resulting in a net increase to Midstream segment results of $181 million and a net reduction to Refining & Marketing segment results of the same amount. No effect was given to prior periods as these entities were not considered businesses prior to February 1, 2018.Midstream segment revenue and segment income from operations increased $468 million and $258 million in the first quarter of 2018, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increases were primarily due to the February 1, 2018 dropdown to MPLX and higher gathered, processed and fractionated volumes resulting from new processing facilities. Additionally, revenues increased by approximately $117 million due to ASC 606 gross ups. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.Intersegment sales to our Refining & Marketing segment increased primarily due to fees charged for fuels distribution and refining logistics services during the first quarter of 2018 following the February 1, 2018 dropdown to MPLX.

Changes in working capital, excluding changes in short-term debt, were a net $933 million use of cash in the first three months of 2018 compared to a net $410 million source of cash in the first three months of 2017. The changes in working capital for the first three months of 2018 were primarily due to a decrease in accounts payables and accrued liabilities partially offset by decreases in inventories and current receivables. Changes from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable decreased $1.23 billion from year-end 2017, primarily due lower crude oil volumes purchased slightly offset by higher crude oil prices.•Inventories decreased $439 million from year-end 2017, due to decreases in crude, refined products and materials and supplies inventories. •Current receivables decreased $82 million from year-end 2017, primarily due to lower refined product volumes slightly offset by higher prices.The net $410 million source of cash in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to decreases in current receivables and inventories partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Changes from December 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Current receivables decreased $333 million from year-end 2016, primarily due to lower refined product volumes, partially offset by higher prices.•Inventories decreased $264 million from year-end 2016, primarily due to decreases in refined product, material and supplies, and crude oil inventories. •Accounts payable decreased $250 million from year-end 2016, primarily due to the timing of costs incurred for certain major maintenance activity and capital projects, partially offset by increases in crude purchase prices and volumes.Net cash used in investing activities was $575 million lower in the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017, primarily due to the following:•MPLX’s investment of $500 million for a partial interest in the Bakken Pipeline system in the first three months of 2017. •MPLX’s acquisition of the Ozark pipeline for $220 million in the first three months of 2017.•Additions to property, plant and equipment increased $145 million primarily due to increased capital expenditures in our Midstream segment. 46Table of Contents The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash.

Financing activities were a net $2.56 billion source of cash in the first three months of 2018 compared to a net $1.52 billion source of cash in the first three months of 2017. •Long-term debt borrowings and repayments, including debt issuance costs, were a net $4.29 billion source of cash in the first three months of 2018 compared to a net $2.01 billion source of cash in the first three months of 2017. During the first three months of 2018, MPLX issued $5.5 billion of senior notes, we redeemed $600 million of our senior notes and MPLX repaid $505 million in outstanding borrowings under the MPLX revolving credit facility. During the first three months of 2017, MPLX issued $2.25 billion of senior notes and we repaid the remaining $200 million balance under the MPC term loan agreement. •Cash used in common stock repurchases increased $907 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017. Share repurchases totaled $1.33 billion in the first three months of 2018 compared to $420 million in the first three months of 2017. See Note 9 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase authorizations.•Cash provided by the issuance of MPLX common units decreased $148 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017 as we did not issue any MPLX common units in the first three months of 2018.•Cash provided by contributions from noncontrolling interests decreased $125 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017, primarily due to MPLX’s sale of a noncontrolling interest in Ohio Fractionation to Sherwood Midstream in the first three months of 2017 for $126 million. •Cash used in distributions to noncontrolling interests increased $37 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017, primarily due to an increase in MPLX’s distribution per common unit. •Cash used in dividend payments increased $29 million in the first three months of 2018 compared to the first three months of 2017, primarily due to a $0.10 per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our dividend payments were $0.46 per common share in the first three months of 2018 compared to $0.36 per common share in the first three months of 2017.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3.

On January 2, 2018, MPLX entered into a $4.1 billion 364-day term-loan facility to fund the cash portion of the February 1, 2018 dropdown consideration.On February 8, 2018, MPLX issued $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering, consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375 percent unsecured senior notes due March 2023, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.000 percent unsecured senior notes due March 2028, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500 percent unsecured senior notes due April 2038, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.700 percent unsecured senior notes due April 2048, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.900 percent unsecured senior notes due April 2058. MPLX used $4.1 billion of the net proceeds of the offering to repay the 364-day term-loan facility. The remaining proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under MPLX’s revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with us and for general partnership purposes. Subsequent to quarter end, MPLX’s credit facility with MPC was amended to increase its capacity to $1 billion to allow additional flexibility to MPLX.On March 15, 2018, we redeemed all of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.700 percent senior notes due December 2018. The 2018 senior notes were redeemed at a price equal to par plus a make whole premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The make whole premium of $2.5 million was calculated based on the market yield of the applicable treasury issue as of the redemption date as determined in accordance with the indenture governing the 2018 senior notes. We established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2018, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. See Note 17 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt.The MPC credit agreements contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC credit agreements requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC credit agreements) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of March 31, 2018, we were in compliance with this financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.07 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPC bank revolving credit facility.48Table of Contents The MPLX credit agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The MPLX credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. Other covenants restrict MPLX and/or certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of March 31, 2018, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.6 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX credit agreement.As disclosed in Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, we expect the adoption of the lease accounting standard update to result in the recognition of a significant lease obligation. The MPC credit agreements and the MPLX credit agreement both contain provisions under which the effects of the new accounting standard are not recognized for purposes of financial covenant calculations.Our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. As of March 31, 2018, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. CompanyRating AgencyRatingMPCMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook) FitchBBB (stable outlook)MPLXMoody’sBaa3 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook) FitchBBB- (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Neither the MPC credit agreements, MPLX credit agreement nor our trade receivables facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the MPC credit agreements, MPLX credit agreement, our trade receivables facility and debt held by our ocean vessel joint venture with Crowley. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis or result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.Capital RequirementsCapital SpendingMPC’s capital investment plan, excluding MPLX, totals approximately $1.6 billion in 2018 for capital projects and investments, excluding capitalized interest and acquisitions. This budget includes spending on refining and marketing, retail and non-MPLX midstream projects as well as amounts designated for corporate projects. The remaining midstream projects are included in the MPLX investment plan which includes $2.2 billion of organic growth capital and approximately $190 million of maintenance capital. There have been no material changes to our 2018 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant. 49Table of Contents Capital expenditures and investments are summarized by segment below.

(b) Includes capitalized interest of $18 million and $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2018 were primarily for Midstream projects including the completion of a butane cavern in Robinson, Illinois, the addition of gas processing plants, three of which were commissioned during the first quarter of 2018, continued work on the expansion of the Ozark pipeline system and expansion of the marine fleet. Other Capital RequirementsDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we made no contributions to our funded pension plans. We have no required funding for 2018, but may make voluntary contributions for future years at our discretion depending on the funding status and the plan asset performance. On April 25, 2018, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.46 per share on common stock. The dividend is payable June 11, 2018, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2018. We may, from time to time, repurchase our senior notes in the open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.Share RepurchasesSince January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $13.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $11.14 billion of our common stock, leaving $1.86 billion available for repurchases at March 31, 2018. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 9 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions, except per share data)2018 2017Number of shares repurchased19 9Cash paid for shares repurchased$1,327 $420Average cost per share$68.74 $50.15We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.Contractual Cash Obligations As of March 31, 2018, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first three months of 2018, our long-term debt commitments increased $9.39 billion due to the public offering of the MPLX senior notes in February 2018, partially offset by the redemption of $600 million of MPC senior notes and repayment of $505 million in outstanding borrowings under the MPLX revolving credit facility.There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.50Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under U.S. GAAP. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital requirements, including our capital budget and investment spending, costs for projects under construction, project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth, upgrades and expansion, the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment, future contributions to our funded pension plans and share repurchases. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking statements regarding capital requirements include: the availability of liquidity; business conditions; a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Capline’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets; a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets; our ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic initiatives discussed herein; adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters; our ability to generate sufficient income and cash flow to effect the intended share repurchases, including within the expected timeframe; our ability to manage disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit rating; the potential impact on our share price if we are unable to effect the intended share repurchases; changes to the expected construction costs and timing of projects; delays in obtaining third-party approvals; changes in labor, materials and equipment costs and availability; planned and unplanned outages; the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects; project cost overruns; disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor or unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response; civil protests and resulting legal/regulatory uncertainty regarding environmental and social issues, including pipeline infrastructure, may prevent or delay the construction and operation of such infrastructure and realization of associated revenues; continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions; the availability and pricing of crude oil and other feedstocks; slower growth in domestic and Canadian crude supply; completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the U.S. Midwest; consumer demand for refined products; transportation logistics; the reliability of processing units and other equipment; MPC's ability to successfully implement growth opportunities; modifications to MPLX earnings and distribution growth objectives; compliance with federal and state environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations, including the cost of compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard, and/or enforcement actions initiated thereunder; adverse results in litigation; changes to MPC's capital budget; other risk factors inherent to MPC's industry. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIESWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE COSTSWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.51Table of Contents On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $650 million between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures to comply with these standards, which includes estimated capital expenditures of approximately $400 million in 2018-2019.There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2018.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2018. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTEDAs discussed in Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future.52Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.See Notes 15 and 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of March 31, 2018 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after March 31, 2018 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt, including the portion classified as current and excluding capital leases, as of March 31, 2018 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(In millions) Fair Value as of March 31, 2018(a) Change inFair Value(b) Change in Net Income for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018(c)Long-term debt     Fixed-rate$17,893  $1,823 n/aVariable-rate— n/a 1(a) Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(b) Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at March 31, 2018.(c) Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under our variable-rate debt, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.53Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2018, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.54Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions)2018 2017Income (Loss) from Operations by Segment   Refining & Marketing(a)$(133) $(70)Speedway95 135Midstream(a)567 309Items not allocated to segments:    Corporate and other unallocated items(88) (83) Pension settlement expenses(1) —Income from operations$440 $291Capital Expenditures and Investments(b)   Refining & Marketing$191 $192Speedway39 35Midstream(c)482 1,070Corporate and Other(d)36 28Total$748 $1,325(a) On February 1, 2018, we contributed certain refining logistics assets and fuels distributions services to MPLX.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. As previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, MarkWest Liberty Midstream and its affiliates agreed in principle to pay a cash penalty of approximately $0.6 million and to undertake certain supplemental environmental projects with an estimated cost of approximately $2.4 million, related to civil enforcement allegations associated with permitting and other regulatory obligations for launcher/receiver and compressor station facilities in southeastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. On April 24, 2018, MarkWest Liberty Midstream and its affiliates entered into a Consent Decree with the EPA and PADEP resolving these issues, subject to a 30-day public comment period, pursuant to which MarkWest Liberty Midstream will pay a penalty of $0.6 million and undertake certain supplemental environmental projects with an estimated cost of approximately $2.4 million, in addition to other related projects that are substantially complete. Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A.
