Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  The Spinoff and Basis of Presentation  On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its RM&T Business into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil common stock. In accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between Marathon Oil and MPC, the distribution of MPC common stock was made on June 30, 2011, with Marathon Oil stockholders receiving one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon Oil common stock. Following the Spinoff, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in MPC, and each company had separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. On July 1, 2011, our common stock began trading “regular-way” on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “MPC”.  Prior to the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, our results of operations and cash flows consisted of the RM&T Business, which represented a combined reporting entity. Subsequent to the Spinoff, our results of operations and cash flows consist of consolidated MPC activities. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The consolidated statements of income for periods prior to the Spinoff include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by Marathon Oil, including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, procurement and information technology. Those allocations were based primarily on specific identification, headcount or computer utilization. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from Marathon Oil, are reasonable. However, the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a stand-alone company during those periods presented prior to the Spinoff and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Subsequent to the Spinoff, we are performing these functions using internal resources or services provided by third parties, certain of which were provided by Marathon Oil during a transition period pursuant to a transition services agreement, which terminated on June 30, 2012.  Corporate Overview  We are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. We currently own and operate six refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.2 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered.  Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer.    30        •    Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our six refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway segment and to dealers and jobbers who operate Marathon® retail outlets;        •    Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway® convenience stores; and        •    Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes, among other transportation-related assets, a majority interest in LOOP, which is the owner and operator of the only U.S. deepwater oil port.  We reported net income of $1.22 billion and $2.63 billion, or $3.59 and $7.65 per diluted share, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to net income of $1.13 billion and $2.46 billion, or $3.16 and $6.88 per diluted share, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The increase in the third quarter of 2012 was primarily due to a gain associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets of $183 million recognized in the third quarter of 2012, partially offset by increases in income taxes of $35 million and pension settlement expenses of $33 million. The increase in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to an increase in our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of $186 million and a gain associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets of $183 million, partially offset by pension settlement expenses of $116 million.  Our Refining & Marketing segment generated income from operations of $1.69 billion in the third quarter of 2012, nearly equal to the $1.71 billion of income generated in the third quarter of 2012. The slight decrease was primarily due to higher crude oil acquisition costs and lower wholesale price realizations compared to market indicators, partially offset by a larger Chicago and U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil (“LLS”) 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread.  Our Refining & Marketing segment generated income from operations of $3.96 billion in the first nine months of 2012 compared to $3.77 billion in the first nine months of 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in our Refining & Marketing gross margin, which averaged $10.92 per barrel in the first nine months of 2012 compared to $10.30 per barrel in the first nine months of 2011. This was primarily a result of a larger USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread, partially offset by unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs.  The Detroit, Michigan refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project has been a significant portion of our 2012 capital spending. The project is nearly complete and on budget. In early September 2012, we began a 70-day turnaround with the expanded Detroit refinery anticipated to be online in November 2012.  Our Speedway segment generated income from operations of $76 million and $233 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to income from operations of $85 million and $198 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The decrease in the third quarter of 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in our gasoline and distillates gross margin and an increase in expenses, partially offset by an increase in our merchandise gross margin. The increase in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to an increase in our merchandise gross margin, partially offset by an increase in expenses.  In July 2012, Speedway LLC acquired 10 convenience stores located in the northern Kentucky and southwestern Ohio regions from Road Ranger LLC in exchange for cash and a truck stop location in the Chicago metropolitan area. In May 2012, Speedway LLC acquired 87 convenience stores situated throughout Indiana and Ohio from GasAmerica Services, Inc. These acquisitions support our strategic initiative to increase Speedway segment sales and complement our existing network of assets.  Our Pipeline Transportation segment generated income from operations of $52 million and $144 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to income from operations of $56 million and $161 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The decreases primarily reflect reductions in income from pipeline affiliates due to reduced shipment volumes and dividend income.    31    On October 7, 2012, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with BP to purchase certain refining assets and related logistics and marketing assets, which we refer to collectively as the BP Texas City assets. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, the assets to be acquired include BP’s 451,000 barrel per calendar day Texas City, Texas refinery, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, an allocation of BP’s Colonial Pipeline Company shipper history, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites and a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility. The base purchase price is $598 million plus the value of inventories at the time of closing, which at current prices is estimated at approximately $1.2 billion. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay to BP a contingent earnout up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. The BP Texas City assets complement our current geographic footprint and align with our strategic initiative of growing in existing and contiguous markets to enhance our portfolio. The transaction is expected to be funded with cash on hand, and is anticipated to close early in 2013, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.  On September 27, 2012, we signed a letter of intent with Harvest Pipeline Company, agreeing to jointly develop infrastructure that will facilitate transportation of hydrocarbon liquids production from the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The proposed project is expected to result in up to 24,000 barrels per day of truck unloading capacity and a terminal capable of loading up to 50,000 barrels per day onto barges on the Ohio River at Wellsville, Ohio.  In 2012, we formed MPLX to own, operate, develop and acquire crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based product pipelines and other midstream assets. Headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, MPLX’s initial assets consist of a 51 percent indirect interest in a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and a 100 percent interest in a butane cavern in West Virginia. On October 31, 2012, MPLX closed its initial public offering of 19,895,000 common units at a price of $22.00 per unit, which included 2,595,000 units purchased by the underwriters through an over-allotment option. Net proceeds to MPLX from the sale of the units was approximately $405 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, structuring fees and estimated offering expenses of $31 million and financing costs of $2 million. MPLX contributed approximately $192 million to Pipe Line Holdings, a subsidiary of MPLX, which Pipe Line Holdings will retain on behalf of MPLX and us to fund our respective pro rata portions of certain estimated expansion capital expenditures. MPLX distributed net proceeds to us of $203 million, in partial consideration of assets contributed and to reimburse us for certain capital expenditures incurred with respect to these assets. MPLX GP LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC, serves as the general partner of MPLX. We own a 73.6 percent interest in MPLX, including the general partner interest. The initial public offering represented the sale of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX.  On February 1, 2012, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan, enabling us to purchase up to $2.0 billion of MPC common stock over a two-year period. On February 3, 2012, we entered into an $850 million ASR program with a major financial institution as part of this authorization. Under the ASR program, we received 17,581,344 shares of MPC common stock in the first quarter of 2012. On July 25, 2012, an additional 2,776,036 shares were delivered to us, for a total of 20,357,380 repurchased shares, which concluded the ASR program. Upon final settlement, the average per share amount paid for all shares purchased under the ASR program was $41.75.  On November 5, 2012, we announced that we entered into a $500 million ASR program. This ASR is the second tranche of share repurchases under the $2 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors in February 2012. The total number of shares to be repurchased will be based generally on the volume-weighted average price of MPC common stock during the repurchase period. It is anticipated that all market repurchases under the ASR will be completed before the end of the first quarter of 2013. As received, we will record the shares acquired as treasury stock. The total value of share repurchases pursuant to the two ASR programs implemented by MPC in 2012 is approximately $1.35 billion, with $650 million remaining under the current authorization.  On September 14, 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement with an initial borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion and terminated our previous revolving credit agreement. On September 14, 2012, MPLX Operations LLC, an affiliate of MPC and wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX following the consummation of the MPLX initial public offering, as the borrower, and MPLX, as the parent guarantor, entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with an initial borrowing loan capacity of $500 million. The agreement became effective upon MPLX’s initial public offering and will provide MPLX with an independent source of liquidity.  The collective bargaining agreement for the hourly workers at our Catlettsburg refinery expired in January 2012. The agreement was temporarily extended while negotiations continued on a new collective bargaining agreement. The union ratified a new agreement in August 2012 and agreed to dismiss the unfair labor practice charges filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The new agreement is scheduled to expire in January 2015.    32    The above discussion includes forward-looking statements that relate to our expectations with respect to the Detroit refinery turnaround, the pending acquisition of the BP Texas City assets, the proposed project with Harvest Pipeline Company and the share repurchase plan. Factors that could affect the Detroit refinery turnaround include, but are not limited to, transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and other risks customarily associated with major maintenance activities. Factors that could affect the pending acquisition of the BP Texas City assets, include, but are not limited to, our ability to successfully complete the acquisition of the BP Texas City assets, including, without limitation, the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Factors that could affect the proposed project with Harvest Pipeline Company, include, but are not limited to, our ability to reach a definitive agreement with Harvest Pipeline Company and the timing and extent of hydrocarbon liquids production and demand from the Utica Shale. Factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing, include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Overview of Segments  Refining & Marketing  Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.  Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent sulfur residual fuel) are used for these crack spread calculations.  Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads which are calculated by reference to light sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.  Historically, West Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”) has traded at prices similar to LLS. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 and 2011, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our Refining & Marketing gross margin.  The following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions:             (In millions, after-tax)         LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity (a) (per $1.00/barrel change)   $ 300     Sweet/sour differential sensitivity (b) (per $1.00/barrel change)     150     LLS-WTI spread sensitivity (c) (per $1.00/barrel change)     65        (a)   Weighted 52% Chicago and 48% USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.    (b)   LLS (prompt)—[delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].    (c)   Assumes 25% of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.  In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:        •    the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;    33        •    the selling prices realized for refined products;        •    the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to manage price risk;        •    the cost of products purchased for resale; and        •    changes in manufacturing costs, which include depreciation and amortization.  Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery, and we charge the related costs to expense when they are incurred. We had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Detroit, Michigan; Garyville, Louisiana and Robinson, Illinois refineries during the first nine months of 2012. During the first nine months of 2011, significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities occurred at our Canton, Ohio refinery.  Speedway  Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation and consumer excise taxes, and the cost of bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillates demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillates generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile.  Pipeline Transportation  The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common-carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillates peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.    34    Results of Operations  Consolidated Results of Operations                                    Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,     (In millions)   2012     2011     Variance     2012     2011     Variance     Revenues and other income:                                 Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)   $ 21,047     $ 20,614     $ 433     $ 61,551     $ 59,165     $ 2,386     Sales to related parties     2       2       —        6       53       (47 )    Income from equity method investments     7       15       (8 )      18       41       (23 )    Net gain on disposal of assets     175       5       170       178       10       168     Other income     18       17       1       28       49       (21 )                                                                  Total revenues and other income     21,249       20,653       596       61,781       59,318       2,463                                                                   Costs and expenses:                                 Cost of revenues (excludes items below)     17,190       16,896       294       51,288       48,107       3,181     Purchases from related parties     84       80       4       204       1,846       (1,642 )    Consumer excise taxes     1,463       1,329       134       4,271       3,807       464     Depreciation and amortization     246       227       19       712       661       51     Selling, general and administrative expenses     305       299       6       944       804       140     Other taxes     66       63       3       204       190       14                                                                   Total costs and expenses     19,354       18,894       460       57,623       55,415       2,208                                                                   Income from operations      1,895       1,759       136       4,158       3,903       255     Related party net interest and other financial income     1       —        1       1       35       (34 )    Net interest and other financial income (costs)     (26 )      (15 )      (11 )      (65 )      (39 )      (26 )                                                                  Income before income taxes     1,870       1,744       126       4,094       3,899       195     Provision for income taxes     646       611       35       1,460       1,435       25                                                                   Net income   $ 1,224     $ 1,133     $ 91     $ 2,634     $ 2,464     $ 170                                                                  Consolidated net income was $91 million and $170 million higher in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The increase in the third quarter of 2012 was primarily due to a gain associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets of $183 million recognized in the third quarter of 2012, partially offset by an increase in income taxes of $35 million and pension settlement expenses of $33 million. The increase in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to an increase in our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of $186 million and a gain associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets of $183 million recognized in the first nine months of 2012, partially offset by increases in pension settlement expenses of $116 million and net interest expense of $60 million. The increase in our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to a higher Refining & Marketing gross margin, which increased to $10.92 per barrel in the first nine months of 2012 from $10.30 per barrel in the first nine months of 2011.  Total revenues and other income increased $596 million in the third quarter and $2.46 billion in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, primarily due to increases in refined product selling prices, crude oil and refinery feedstock sales volumes and consumer excise taxes. The first nine months of 2012 also had an increase in refined product sales volumes compared to the first nine months of 2011.  Sales to related parties decreased $47 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011 primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil sales volumes. The crude oil sales in 2011 were to Marathon Oil, which are not classified as related party sales in periods subsequent to the June 30, 2011 Spinoff.  Income from equity method investments decreased $8 million in the third quarter and $23 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The $8 million decrease in the third quarter of 2012 was primarily due to a $6 million decrease in income from our ethanol investments and a $2 million increase in losses from our investment in Centennial. The $23 million decrease in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to a $13 million decrease in income from our investment in LOOP and an $11 million decrease in income from our ethanol investments. Our ethanol investments experienced lower product margins in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 and LOOP experienced reductions in shipment volumes in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. At September 30, 2012, Centennial was not shipping product; therefore, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial and concluded that no impairment was required.    35    Net gain on disposal of assets increased $170 million in the third quarter and $168 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, primarily due to the $171 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets, which included $86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Other income decreased $21 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011, primarily due to a decrease in income from transition services provided to the buyer of our Minnesota Assets, a decrease in dividends received from our investment in a pipeline company and a decrease in sales of Renewable Identification Numbers. These decreases were partially offset by $12 million of dividend income recognized in the first nine months of 2012 from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our Minnesota Assets, which were paid in connection with our settlement agreement with the buyer. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Minnesota Assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer.  Cost of revenues increased $3.18 billion in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011. The increase in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to higher acquisition costs of crude oil and refined products in the Refining & Marketing segment, which resulted from increased volumes and increased crude oil prices. The increase in crude oil volumes was partially due to purchases from Marathon Oil not being classified as related party purchases in periods subsequent to the Spinoff. These impacts were partially offset by decreased acquisition costs of other charge and blendstocks, primarily due to decreased volumes. In the first nine months of 2012, crude oil volumes were up 6 percent, refined product volumes were up 12 percent and other charge and blendstocks volumes were down 15 percent.  Purchases from related parties decreased $1.64 billion in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011, primarily due to purchases of crude oil from Marathon Oil after the June 30, 2011 Spinoff not being classified as related party transactions.  Consumer excise taxes increased $134 million in the third quarter and $464 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011, primarily due to the December 31, 2011 expiration of the federal excise tax blender’s credits for ethanol and biodiesel.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $140 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011. Employee compensation and benefits expenses comprised $132 million of the increase, which was primarily due to $116 million of pension settlement expenses that were recognized in the first nine months of 2012. Contract service expenses increased $51 million primarily due to higher information technology costs associated with being a separate stand-alone company and higher refinery-related contract services. These impacts were partially offset by lower shared services costs and having no allocations from Marathon Oil subsequent to the Spinoff.  Related party net interest and other financial income decreased $34 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011, primarily due to our short-term investments in PFD Preferred Stock being redeemed prior to the Spinoff. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment in PFD Preferred Stock.  Net interest and other financial costs increased $11 million in the third quarter and $26 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, primarily reflecting decreased foreign currency gains and increased bank service and other fees. We capitalized third-party interest of $29 million in the third quarter and $95 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to $28 million and $76 million in the same periods of 2011. The capitalized interest is primarily associated with the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project.    36    Segment Results  Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table:                             Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,     (In millions)   2012     2011     2012     2011     Refining & Marketing   $ 19,631     $ 19,244     $ 57,359     $ 55,261     Speedway     3,788       3,668       10,706       10,236     Pipeline Transportation     116       107       324       302                                               Segment revenues     23,535       23,019       68,389       65,799     Elimination of intersegment revenues     (2,485 )      (2,403 )      (6,829 )      (6,581 )                                              Total revenues   $ 21,050     $ 20,616     $ 61,560     $ 59,218                                               Items included in both revenues and costs:                       Consumer excise taxes   $ 1,463     $ 1,329     $ 4,271     $ 3,807    Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $387 million in the third quarter and $2.10 billion in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, primarily due to increases in refined product selling prices, crude oil sales volumes and consumer excise taxes. Our average refined product selling prices, including consumer excise taxes, were $3.05 per gallon and $3.04 per gallon in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to $3.01 per gallon and $2.97 per gallon in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas.

Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 714 million gallons in the third quarter and 2.00 billion gallons in the first nine months of 2012 compared to 715 million gallons in the third quarter and 1.99 billion gallons in the first nine months of 2011.  Speedway segment revenues increased $120 million in the third quarter and $470 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, primarily due to higher gasoline and distillates sales, which increased $84 million and $355 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, and higher merchandise sales, which increased $29 million and $94 million in the same periods. The increase in gasoline and distillates sales in the third quarter was primarily due to higher selling prices while the increase in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to higher selling prices and higher sales volumes. Our gasoline and distillates sales volumes increased 48 million gallons in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011, primarily attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores. Our gasoline and distillates selling prices averaged $3.63 per gallon and $3.59 per gallon in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to $3.55 per gallon and $3.51 per gallon in the third quarter and first nine months of 2011.    37    Income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table:                             Three Months Ended September 30,      Nine Months Ended September 30,      (In millions)    2012       2011       2012       2011      Income from operations by segment:                       Refining & Marketing   $ 1,691     $ 1,711     $ 3,959     $ 3,773     Speedway     76       85       233       198     Pipeline Transportation     52       56       144       161     Items not allocated to segments:                       Corporate and other unallocated items (a)     (74 )      (93 )      (245 )      (229 )    Minnesota Assets sale settlement gain     183       —        183       —      Pension settlement expenses     (33 )      —        (116 )      —                                                Income from operations     1,895       1,759       4,158       3,903     Net interest and other financial income (costs) (b)     (25 )      (15 )      (64 )      (4 )                                              Income before income taxes   $ 1,870     $ 1,744     $ 4,094     $ 3,899                                                  (a)   Corporate and other unallocated items consists primarily of MPC’s corporate administrative expenses, including allocations from Marathon Oil for the periods prior to the Spinoff and costs related to certain non-operating assets.

The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment’s business.

(c)   Blended Chicago/USGC crack spread is 52%/48% in 2012 and 53%/47% in 2011 based on MPC’s refining capacity by region in each period.    (d)   LLS (prompt)—[delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].  Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $20 million in the third quarter and increased $186 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011, primarily due to changes in the Refining & Marketing gross margin per barrel, which averaged $13.12 per barrel in the third quarter and $10.92 per barrel in the first nine months of 2012 compared to $13.18 per barrel in the third quarter and $10.30 per barrel in the first nine months of 2011. Our realized Refining & Marketing gross margin for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 benefited from increases in the Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread of $5.83 per barrel and $3.58 per barrel in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, and we estimate this had positive impacts on our Refining & Marketing gross margin of $709 million and $1.29 billion, respectively.  The positive impacts on the Refining & Marketing gross margin for both the three and nine months of 2012 compared to same periods in 2011 were offset by narrower crude oil differentials compared to the benchmark LLS crude oil and other unfavorable crude oil acquisition costs, lower wholesale price realizations compared to the market indicators , as well as higher direct operating costs, primarily associated with higher planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses. The Robinson refinery turnaround initiated in the second quarter was completed in July 2012. We began the Detroit refinery turnaround in early September 2012.    38    The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs:                             Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,         2012       2011       2012       2011      Refinery Throughputs (thousands of barrels per day):                       Crude oil refined     1,186       1,201       1,180       1,171     Other charge and blendstocks     159       167       155       183                                               Total     1,345       1,368       1,335       1,354                                              The decrease in crude oil refined throughput in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011 was primarily due to the planned turnarounds at the Detroit and Robinson refineries in the third quarter of 2012. The decreases in other charge and blendstocks throughput in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011 were primarily due to the aforementioned planned turnarounds in the third quarter of 2012 and a combination of increased crude oil throughput and feedstock economics at our Garyville refinery in the first nine months of 2012.  Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 56 percent and 52 percent of our crude oil processed in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to 50 percent and 53 percent in the same periods of 2011.  The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment:                             Three Months EndedSeptember 30,     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,         2012       2011       2012       2011      Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel) (a)   $ 13.12     $ 13.18     $ 10.92     $ 10.30     Direct operating costs in Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel): (b)                       Planned turnaround and major maintenance   $ 1.18     $ 0.36     $ 1.04     $ 0.74     Depreciation and amortization     1.44       1.28       1.40       1.29     Other manufacturing (c)     3.16       3.11       3.13       3.19                                               Total   $ 5.78     $ 4.75     $ 5.57     $ 5.22                                               Refined product sales volumes (thousands of barrels per day) (d)     1,605       1,610       1,569       1,571        (a)   Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs, purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization, divided by Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes.

Speedway segment income from operations decreased $9 million in the third quarter and increased $35 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The decrease in the third quarter of 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in our gasoline and distillates gross margin attributable to higher prices paid for gasoline and distillates purchases and an increase in expenses primarily attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores. Partially offsetting these decreases in segment income is an increase in our merchandise gross margin primarily attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores. The increase in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise gross margin, partially offset by an increase in expenses primarily attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores. Merchandise gross margin was $217 million in the third quarter and $599 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to $200 million in the third quarter and $536 million in the first nine months of 2011. The increases in the merchandise gross margin were primarily due to margin expansion resulting from higher merchandise and food sales along with an increase in the number of convenience stores. Same-store merchandise sales decreased 0.8 percent in the third quarter and increased 1.0 percent in first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011.  Speedway’s gasoline and distillates gross margin per gallon averaged 11.00 cents in the third quarter and 12.81 cents in the first nine months of 2012, compared with 12.57 cents in the third quarter and 12.77 cents in the first nine months of 2011. Same-store gasoline sales volume decreased 3.9 percent and 1.1 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 compared to the same periods of 2011. The primary factor affecting lower same-store gasoline sales volume in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 was the higher average retail price of gasoline.    39    Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations decreased $17 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011. The decrease primarily reflects a reduction in income from pipeline affiliates due to reduced shipment volumes and dividend income.  Corporate and other unallocated expenses decreased $19 million in the third quarter and increased $16 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2011. The decrease in the third quarter of 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment initiated in the second quarter of 2012. The increase in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to our administrative units realizing the impact of being a stand-alone company in 2012 compared to expenses incurred prior to the June 30, 2011 Spinoff, partially offset by lower pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment in the second quarter of 2012.  We recognized a gain of $183 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets, which included $86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Minnesota Assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer.  We recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $33 million in the third quarter and $116 million in the first nine months of 2012 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred in those periods. See Note 18 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the pension plan amendments.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash Flows  Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $3.39 billion at September 30, 2012 compared to $3.08 billion at December 31, 2011. The change in cash and cash equivalents was due to the factors discussed below.  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.45 billion in the first nine months of 2012, compared to $2.67 billion in the first nine months of 2011. The $0.22 billion decrease was primarily due to an increase in cash used in working capital, partially offset by increases in cash provided by net income. Changes in working capital were a net $1.35 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2012 compared to a net $644 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2011. The $1.35 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from a reduction in crude oil payable volumes and an increase in inventories resulting primarily from interim seasonal increases in refined products and crude oil inventory volumes. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was a decrease in accounts receivable primarily caused by lower crude oil receivable volumes, partially offset by higher refined products receivables. The $644 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2011 was primarily due to the impact of increased crude oil and refined product prices on accounts receivable and the impact of increased crude oil inventory volumes, partially offset by the impact of increased crude oil prices on accounts payable.  Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.03 billion in the first nine months of 2012, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $1.64 billion in the first nine months of 2011. The $2.67 billion change was primarily due to net redemptions of related party debt securities in the first nine months of 2011.  Net investments in related party debt securities was a source of cash of $2.40 billion in the first nine months of 2011. All such activity reflected the net cash flow from redemptions and purchases of PFD Preferred Stock. Prior to the Spinoff, all investments in PFD Preferred Stock were redeemed, and the agreement with PFD was terminated. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in PFD Preferred Stock.    40    The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. The following table reconciles additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments:                     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,     (In millions)   2012     2011     Additions to property, plant and equipment   $ 966     $ 844     Acquisitions(a)     180       74     Decrease in capital accruals     (77 )      (31 )                          Total capital expenditures     1,069       887     Investments in equity method investees     12       7                           Total capital expenditures and investments   $ 1,081     $ 894                              (a)   Excludes inventory acquired and liability assumed in 2012.  Capital expenditures and investments are summarized by segment below:                     Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,     (In millions)   2012     2011     Refining & Marketing   $ 513     $ 600     Speedway(a)     257       121     Pipeline Transportation     169       69     Corporate and Other (b)     142       104                           Total   $ 1,081     $ 894                              (a)  Includes acquisitions of 97 convenience stores in 2012 and 23 convenience stores in 2011.    (b)  Includes capitalized interest of $95 million and $86 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project comprised 56 percent and 61 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in the first nine months of 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Cash used in acquisitions, as presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows, increased $116 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011, primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores acquired by Speedway LLC, which acquired 97 convenience stores in the first nine months of 2012 and 23 convenience stores in the first nine months of 2011.  Cash provided by disposal of assets decreased $89 million in the first nine months of 2012 compared to the first nine months of 2011, primarily due to the collection of a receivable in the first nine months of 2011 related to the sale of our Minnesota Assets in December 2010.  Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.11 billion in the first nine months of 2012 and $1.47 billion in the first nine months of 2011. The net use of cash in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to the common stock repurchases under our ASR program and dividend payments. The net use of cash in the first nine months of 2011 was primarily due to the net repayment of debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries and net distributions to Marathon Oil, partially offset by cash provided by the issuance of long-term debt. These activities were undertaken to effect the Spinoff. See Note 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on our long-term debt.  Net borrowings and repayments under our long-term debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries was a use of cash of $3.62 billion in the first nine months of 2011. The financing agreements with Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries were terminated in 2011. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these financing agreements.  Distributions to Marathon Oil totaled $699 million in the first nine months of 2011, primarily related to net cash distributions paid to Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff, partially offset by income taxes it incurred on our behalf.    41    Derivative Instruments  See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.  Capital Resources  As of September 30, 2012, our liquidity totaled $6.39 billion consisting of:             (In millions)   September 30,2012     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 3,387     Revolving credit agreement(a)     2,000     Trade receivables securitization facility     1,000                 Total   $ 6,387                    (a)   Excludes the MPLX Credit Agreement.  At September 30, 2012, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreement or our trade receivables securitization facility.  Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund our current operations, and also meet our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.  On September 14, 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders and terminated our previous revolving credit agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, we have an initial borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion. We have the right to seek to increase the total amount available under the Credit Agreement to $2.5 billion, subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. The Credit Agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $2.0 billion and swingline loan capacity of up $100 million. We may, subject to certain conditions, request that the term of the Credit Agreement be extended for up to two additional one-year periods. Each such extension would be subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding, and the commitment of any lender that does not consent to an extension of the maturity date will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date.  The Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of this type. The financial covenant included in the Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2012, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.02 to 1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes limitations on the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement and our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to incur liens on property or assets or enter into certain transactions with affiliates.  Borrowings of revolving loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at either (i) the sum of the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging between 1.00 percent to 2.00 percent, depending on our credit ratings, or (ii) the sum of the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging between zero percent to 1.00 percent, depending on our credit ratings. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees, annual commitment fees ranging from 0.10 percent to 0.35 percent, depending on our credit ratings, on the unused portion, fees in respect to letters of credit and other fees.  On September 14, 2012, MPLX Operations LLC, an affiliate of MPC and wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX following the consummation of the MPLX initial public offering, as the borrower, and MPLX, as the parent guarantor, entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement (“MPLX Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, which will provide MPLX with an independent source of liquidity following the MPLX initial public offering. The MPLX Credit Agreement has an initial borrowing loan capacity of $500 million. MPLX has the right to seek to increase the total amount available under the MPLX Credit Agreement to $800 million, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. The MPLX Credit Agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $250 million and swingline loan capacity up to $50 million. MPLX may, subject to certain conditions, request that the term of the MPLX    42     Credit Agreement be extended for up to two additional one-year periods. Each such extension would be subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding, and the commitment of any lender that does not consent to an extension of the maturity date will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date.  The MPLX Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of that type. The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions).  Borrowings of revolving loans under the MPLX Credit Agreement bear interest, at either (i) the sum of the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging from 1.00 percent to 2.00 percent, or (ii) the sum of the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement), plus a margin ranging from zero percent to 1.00 percent. Prior to MPLX receiving a rating from Standard & Poor’s Rating Group or Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. for its Index Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement), the margin that is added to the applicable interest rate is based on MPLX’s ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters. Once MPLX receives a rating, the margin added to the applicable interest rate will be based on MPLX’s credit ratings. The MPLX Credit Agreement also provides for customary fees, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees ranging from 0.10 percent to 0.35 percent of the unused portion, depending on MPLX’s ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters prior to the rating date, or MPLX’s credit ratings subsequent to the rating date, fronting and issuance fees in respect to letters of credit and other fees.  As of September 30, 2012, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows:           Rating Agency     Rating    Moody’s   Baa2 (stable outlook)   Standard & Poor’s   BBB (stable outlook)  The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.  Neither our Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under our Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility.  Debt-to-Total-Capital Ratio  Our debt-to-total-capital ratio (total debt to total debt plus stockholders’ equity) was 23 percent at September 30, 2012 and 26 percent at December 31, 2011 as shown in the calculation below.                 (In millions)   September 30,2012     December 31,2011     Long-term debt due within one year   $ 20     $ 15     Long-term debt     3,329       3,292                           Total debt   $ 3,349     $ 3,307                           Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:             Total debt   $ 3,349     $ 3,307     Plus stockholders’ equity     11,467       9,505                           Total debt plus stockholders’ equity   $ 14,816     $ 12,812                           Debt-to-total-capital ratio     23 %      26 %     43    Capital Requirements  We have a capital and investment budget of $1.42 billion, excluding capitalized interest, for 2012. Approximately 25% of the 2012 budget has been for the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, which was nearly complete by the end of the third quarter of 2012. The budget also includes spending on other refining, transportation, logistics and marketing projects, spending for new construction and acquisitions to expand our Speedway segment, and amounts designated for corporate activities. There have been no material changes to our 2012 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital and investment budget and make changes as conditions warrant.  During the first nine months of 2012, we made contributions of approximately $127 million to our funded pension plans in 2012. We do not expect to make additional funding contributions to our funded pension plans over the remainder of 2012.  On October 31, 2012, our board of directors approved a 35 cents per share dividend, payable December 10, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 21, 2012.  On February 1, 2012, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan, enabling us to purchase up to $2.0 billion of MPC common stock over a two-year period. We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, ASRs or open market solicitations for shares. On February 3, 2012, we entered into an $850 million ASR program with a major financial institution as part of this authorization. Under the ASR program, we received 17,581,344 shares of MPC common stock in the first quarter of 2012. On July 25, 2012, an additional 2,776,036 shares were delivered to us, for a total of 20,357,380 repurchased shares, which concluded the ASR program. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR program was based on the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the repurchase period, subject to provisions that set a minimum and maximum number of shares. Upon final settlement, the average per share amount paid for all shares purchased under the ASR program was $41.75. The shares repurchased under the ASR program were accounted for as treasury stock purchase transactions, reducing the weighted average number of basic and diluted common shares outstanding by the shares repurchased, and as forward contracts indexed to our common stock.  On November 5, 2012, we announced that we entered into a $500 million ASR program. This ASR is the second tranche of share repurchases under the $2 billion share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors in February 2012. The total number of shares to be repurchased will be based generally on the volume-weighted average price of MPC common stock during the repurchase period. It is anticipated that all market repurchases under the ASR will be completed before the end of the first quarter of 2013. As received, we will record the shares acquired as treasury stock. The total value of share repurchases pursuant to the two ASR programs implemented by MPC in 2012 is approximately $1.35 billion, with $650 million remaining under the current authorization. The timing of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.  The above discussion includes forward-looking statements that relate to our expectations with respect to the share repurchase plan. Factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Contractual Cash Obligations  As of September 30, 2012, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. There were no material changes to these obligations since December 31, 2011 outside the ordinary course of business.  On October 7, 2012, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to purchase the BP Texas City assets. The base purchase price is $598 million plus the value of inventories at the time of closing, which at current prices is estimated at approximately $1.2 billion. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay to BP a contingent earnout up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. The transaction is expected to be funded with cash on hand, and is anticipated to close early in 2013, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.  The above discussion includes forward-looking statements that relate to our expectations with respect to the pending acquisition of the BP Texas City assets. Factors that could affect the pending acquisition of the BP Texas City assets, include, but are not limited to, our ability to successfully complete the acquisition of the BP Texas City assets, including, without limitation, the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.    44    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.  We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with the Spinoff, we entered into arrangements with Marathon Oil providing various indemnities and guarantees. These arrangements are described in Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include, but are not limited to, our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks, natural gas and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.  Transactions with Related Parties  Following completion of the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in us and is no longer a related party.  Purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil accounted for five percent or less of the combined total of cost of revenues and purchases from related parties for periods prior to the Spinoff. Related party purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil were at market-based contract prices. The crude oil prices were based on indices that represented market value for time and place of delivery and that were also used in third-party contracts. The natural gas prices equaled the price at which Marathon Oil purchased the natural gas from third parties plus the cost of transportation.  We believe that transactions with related parties, other than certain transactions with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and related to the provision of administrative services, were conducted under terms comparable to those with unaffilated parties.  On May 25, 2011, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and to provide a framework for our relationship with Marathon Oil. Because the terms of our separation from Marathon Oil and these agreements were entered into in the context of a related party transaction, the terms may not be comparable to terms that would be obtained in a transaction between unaffiliated parties.  Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs  We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.    45    There have been no significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2012.  Critical Accounting Estimates  There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2012.  Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  In July 2012, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that gives an entity the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, through the qualitative assessment, an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, the quantitative impairment test must then be performed. The accounting standards update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this accounting standards update is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  In December 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires disclosure of additional information related to recognized financial and derivative instruments that are offset or are not offset but are subject to an enforceable netting agreement. The purpose of the requirement is to help users evaluate the effect or potential effect of offsetting and related netting arrangements on an entity’s financial position. The update is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods that begin on or after January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods. Adoption of this update is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.    46    Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.  See Notes 14 and 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. During the first quarter of 2012, we terminated our interest rate swap agreements, which we had designated as fair value hedges.  Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of September 30, 2012 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.  We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after September 30, 2012 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.  Sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point shift in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2012 is provided in the following table.                 (In millions)   Fair Value     IncrementalChange inFair Value     Financial assets (liabilities)(a)             Long-term debt(b)   $ (3,489 ) (c)    $ (357 ) (d)       (a)   Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.    (b)   Excludes capital leases.    (c)   Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.    (d)   Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at September 30, 2012.  At September 30, 2012, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments. Therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value.    47    Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2012, the end of the period covered by this report.

Legal Proceedings  We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal proceedings involving a variety of matters, including matters relating to environmental laws and regulations. Any specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.  Litigation  We are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Environmental Proceedings  As reported in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, we engaged in discussions with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to proactively enter into a consent decree regarding the operation of flares at our six refineries in order to minimize flare emissions. The resulting Flare Consent Decree was executed by us on February 24, 2012 and lodged in Federal District Court in Michigan on April 5, 2012. The Flare Consent Decree included a civil penalty of $460,000, as well as injunctive relief designed to ensure that good combustion and flare minimizations practices are employed at the 22 flares located at our six refineries. It is anticipated that this consent decree will reduce emissions by approximately 5,400 tons per year. In August 2012, the Flare Consent Decree was signed and entered by the court and we paid the civil penalty of $460,000 in September 2012.  As reported in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, in September 2011, Marathon Petroleum Company LP received an Enforcement Notice from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (“MDEQ”) regarding a product release at a facility in Stockbridge, Michigan. In the Enforcement Notice, MDEQ alleged certain environmental violations involving Michigan’s water protection laws. In September 2012, we agreed to and paid a civil penalty of $186,000 in accordance with the terms of an agreed upon Administrative Consent Order.  We are involved in a number of other environmental enforcement proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Item 1A. Risk Factors  We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    51    Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
