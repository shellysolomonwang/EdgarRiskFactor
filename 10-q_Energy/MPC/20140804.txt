Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered.Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets;•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway® convenience stores; and•Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX and MPC’s retained pipeline assets and investments.Executive SummarySelect results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions, except per share data) 2014 2013 2014 2013Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing$1,260 $903 $1,622 $2,008Speedway94 123 152 190Pipeline Transportation81 58 153 109Net income attributable to MPC$855 $593 $1,054 $1,318Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$2.95 $1.83 $3.60 $4.01Net income attributable to MPC increased $262 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2014 and decreased $264 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment.27Table of ContentsRefining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $357 million in the second quarter and decreased $386 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The increase in the second quarter was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and a higher U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) crack spread, partially offset by a narrower Light Louisiana Sweet ("LLS") - West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil differential and a lower Chicago crack spread. The decrease in the first six months was primarily due to an increase in refinery direct operating costs, a narrower LLS-WTI crude oil differential and a lower sweet/sour crude oil differential, partially offset by more favorable net product price realizations and a higher USGC crack spread.Speedway segment income from operations decreased $29 million in the second quarter and $38 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to decreases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin and increases in operating expenses, partially offset by increases in our merchandise gross margin. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $23 million in the second quarter and $44 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to higher pipeline transportation revenue and increases in equity affiliate income from our investment in LOOP.On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites, a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 thousand barrel per day ("mbpd") allocation of space on the Colonial Pipeline. We refer to these assets as the “Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.” We paid $1.49 billion for these assets, which included $935 million for inventory. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In July 2014, we paid BP $180 million for the first period's contingent earnout. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Our financial results and operating statistics for the period prior to the acquisition does not include amounts for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition.On May 21, 2014, Speedway entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Hess Corporation to purchase Hess Retail. This acquisition will incorporate all of Hess' retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40 mbpd on Colonial Pipeline. The total consideration is $2.874 billion comprised of a cash purchase price of $2.37 billion, an estimated $230 million of net working capital and $274 million of capital leases. The acquisition is expected to be funded with a combination of debt and available cash and is anticipated to close later this year, subject to customary closing conditions. This acquisition will significantly expand our retail presence from nine to 23 states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow higher-valued, stable cash flow businesses. This acquisition will also enable us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for an incremental 200 mbpd of assured sales from our refining system.Effective March 1, 2014, we sold MPLX a 13 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings for $310 million, increasing MPLX's ownership interest in Pipe Line Holdings to 69 percent. MPLX financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit agreement. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.In March 2014, we acquired from Chevron Raven Ridge Pipe Line Company an additional seven percent interest in Explorer for $77 million, bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent. Due to this increase in our ownership percentage, we now account for our investment in Explorer using the equity method of accounting and report Explorer as a related party. Explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Hammond, Indiana.In 2013, we agreed with Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. ("Enbridge") to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline, which will run from Beaver Lodge, North Dakota to Superior, Wisconsin and is targeted to be operational in early 2016. We also agreed to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project, which is currently estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. We made contributions of $75 million during the first six months of 2014 and have contributed $99 million since project inception. In exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge's North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service. Enbridge's North Dakota System currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long. We will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements. See Notes 4 and 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.28Table of ContentsIn July 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.'s SAX pipeline through our investment in Illinois Extension Pipeline. The SAX pipeline will run from from Flanagan, Illinois to Patoka, Illinois and is targeted to be operational in mid 2015. We agreed to fund 35 percent of the estimated $850 million construction costs for the SAX pipeline project, of which approximately $295 million is our share. In July, we made an initial contribution of $69 million to fund our portion of the construction costs for the project.During the first six months of 2014, we paid $1.15 billion to acquire 13 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $87.82 per delivered share. At June 30, 2014, we also had agreements to repurchase additional common shares for $12 million, which were settled in early July 2014. As of June 30, 2014, we had an outstanding repurchase authorization of $709 million, which expires in September 2015. On July 30, 2014, our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization expiring in July 2016. See Note 7 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the pending acquisition of Hess Retail, the estimated construction costs and completion of the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects and the share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the pending acquisition of Hess Retail include, but are not limited to, our ability to successfully complete the pending acquisition of Hess Retail, including, without limitation, the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Factors that could affect the estimated construction costs and completion of the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects, include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of purchased products. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Historically, WTI has traded at prices similar to LLS. During 2011 and continuing through the first half of 2013, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our Refining & Marketing gross margin. Logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets and other market factors acted to keep the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions. However, due to a variety of domestic and international market conditions including the growth in pipeline capacity from Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast region, the differential between WTI and LLS significantly narrowed during the second half of 2013 with a further narrowing broadly continuing through the first half of 2014. Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors.29Table of ContentsThe following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.

Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. We had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Galveston Bay, Texas; Garyville, Louisiana and Robinson, Illinois refineries during the first six months of 2014 compared to activities at our Catlettsburg, Garyville and Galveston Bay refineries during the first six months of 2013.SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway's gross margin. Approximately two-thirds of Speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in the second quarter and first six months of 2014. Speedway's convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.Pipeline TransportationThe profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.30Table of ContentsResults of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions) 2014 2013 Variance 2014 2013 VarianceRevenues and other income:           Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$26,844 $25,677 $1,167 $50,129 $49,007 $1,122Income from equity method investments57 7 50 92 7 85Net gain on disposal of assets11 1 10 12 2 10Other income21 18 3 45 32 13Total revenues and other income26,933 25,703 1,230 50,278 49,048 1,230Costs and expenses:           Cost of revenues (excludes items below)23,096 22,320 776 43,636 42,354 1,282Purchases from related parties130 79 51 289 151 138Consumer excise taxes1,599 1,596 3 3,114 3,054 60Depreciation and amortization325 302 23 645 589 56Selling, general and administrative expenses316 358 (42) 662 607 55Other taxes98 88 10 202 177 25Total costs and expenses25,564 24,743 821 48,548 46,932 1,616Income from operations1,369 960 409 1,730 2,116 (386)Net interest and other financial income (costs)(48) (45) (3) (94) (93) (1)Income before income taxes1,321 915 406 1,636 2,023 (387)Provision for income taxes457 316 141 565 694 (129)Net income864 599 265 1,071 1,329 (258)Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests9 6 3 17 11 6Net income attributable to MPC$855 $593 $262 $1,054 $1,318 $(264)Net income attributable to MPC increased $262 million in the second quarter and decreased $264 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations, which increased $357 million in the second quarter and decreased $386 million in the first six months. The increase in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations in the second quarter was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and a higher USGC crack spread, partially offset by a narrower LLS-WTI crude oil differential and a lower Chicago crack spread. The decrease in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations in the first six months was primarily due to an increase in refinery direct operating costs, a narrower LLS-WTI crude oil differential and a lower sweet/sour crude oil differential, partially offset by more favorable net product price realizations and a higher USGC crack spread.Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $1.17 billion in the second quarter and $1.12 billion in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to an increase in refined product sales prices in the second quarter and higher refined product sales volumes in the first six months.Income from equity method investments increased $50 million in the second quarter and $85 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to increases in income from our ethanol affiliates of $32 million and $61 million, respectively, and increases in income from our pipeline affiliates of $17 million and $24 million, respectively. The increases in income from our ethanol affiliates includes the affects of our acquisition of interests in TAAE, TACE and The Andersons Ethanol Investment LLC in August 2013. The higher income from our pipeline affiliates is primarily due to increases from LOOP, as well as income from Explorer, which is now reflected in our results following our acquisition of an increased ownership interest in this pipeline company. 31Table of ContentsCentennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the first six months of 2014. At June 30, 2014, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If current business conditions remain unchanged and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of June 30, 2014, our equity investment in Centennial was $35 million and we had a $40 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial's outstanding debt. See Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.Net gain on disposal of assets increased $10 million for both the second quarter and first six months of 2014 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2013, primarily due to the sale of two terminals.Other income increased $3 million in the second quarter and $13 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to higher gains on sales of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) of $19 million and $30 million, respectively, partially offset by an $11 million impairment of an investment in a company accounted for using the cost method and the absence of dividends received from Explorer, which were recorded as other income in 2013. Cost of revenues increased $776 million in the second quarter and $1.28 billion in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The increases were primarily due to:•increases in refined product cost of sales of $607 million for the second quarter and $691 million for the first six months, primarily due to higher raw material costs and sales volumes for the second quarter and higher sales volumes partially offset by lower raw material costs for the first six months; and•increases in refinery direct operating costs, including costs associated with significant turnaround activity at the Galveston Bay refinery, of $153 million, or $1.03 per barrel of total refinery throughput, for the second quarter and $774 million, or $2.55 per barrel of total refinery throughput, for the first six months.Purchases from related parties increased $51 million in the second quarter and $138 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to:•acquisitions of ownership interests in TAAE and Explorer, resulting in purchases from these companies totaling $35 million and $64 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, being reported as purchases from related parties while purchases from these companies during the second quarter and first six months of 2013 were reported as cost of revenues;•an increase in purchases from LOOP of $44 million in the first six months of 2014; and •increases in purchases from TAME and TACE of $17 million for the second quarter and $22 million for the first six months.Depreciation and amortization increased $23 million in the second quarter and $56 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to accelerated depreciation of equipment at two refineries and the implementation of corporate-level information technology projects, partially offset by an impairment of a light products terminal in 2013.Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $42 million in the second quarter and increased $55 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The decrease in the second quarter was primarily due to a decrease in pension settlement expenses of $55 million resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during those periods, partially offset by an increase in contract services. The increase in the first six months was primarily due to an increase in contract services, an increase in employee compensation and benefit expenses and an increase in pension settlement expenses of $9 million.Other taxes increased $10 million in the second quarter and $25 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to increases in payroll taxes and sales and use tax expense. Provision for income taxes increased $141 million in the second quarter and decreased $129 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to changes in income before income taxes, which increased $406 million in the second quarter and decreased $387 million in the first six months. The effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of both 2014 and 2013 are equivalent to or slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense.32Table of ContentsThe above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment. Factors that could affect the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment include, but are not limited to, a change in business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Segment ResultsRevenues, including intersegment sales, are summarized by segment in the following table.

These expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $357 million in the second quarter and decreased $386 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The increase in the second quarter was primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and a higher USGC crack spread, partially offset by a narrower LLS-WTI crude oil differential and a lower Chicago crack spread. The decrease in the first six months was primarily due to an increase in refinery direct operating costs, a narrower LLS-WTI crude oil differential and a lower sweet/sour crude oil differential, partially offset by more favorable net product price realizations and a higher USGC crack spread. The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment’s business.

Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, mix and crude costs as well as other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had estimated positive impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income of $657 million for the second quarter and $833 million for the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. We believe product price realizations as compared to spot market values comprised a significant portion of the increases in segment income for both the second quarter and the first six months. We also believe the product price realizations as compared to spot market values in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 were negatively impacted by volatility in the Chicago market and effects of the Renewable Fuel Standard. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

The increases in other manufacturing costs were primarily attributable to higher energy and routine maintenance costs for both periods and higher catalyst expenses for the first six months. The increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for the first six months was primarily due to significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at the Galveston Bay refinery. We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with purchased RINs decreased to $22 million in the second quarter and $93 million in the first six months of 2014 from $65 million in the second quarter and $107 million in the first six months of 2013. The decrease in the second quarter was primarily due to decreases in the average cost of ethanol and biomass-based biodiesel RINs. The decrease in the first six months was primarily due to a decrease in the average cost of biomass-based biodiesel RINs and a decrease in our estimated advanced biofuel obligation volume, partially offset by an increase in the average cost of ethanol RINs.36Table of ContentsSpeedway segment income from operations decreased $29 million in the second quarter and $38 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The severe weather conditions in the Midwest impacted all aspects of the business for the first quarter of 2014. The decreases in segment income were primarily due to decreases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin and increases in operating expenses, partially offset by increases in our merchandise gross margin. Speedway's gasoline and distillate gross margin decreased $32 million, or $0.0456 per gallon, for the second quarter and $40 million, or $0.0305 per gallon, for the first six months. Operating expenses were higher primarily due to an increase in the number of stores, as well as due to weather conditions for the six months. Our merchandise gross margin increased $12 million for the second quarter and $20 million for the first six months primarily due to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins.The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment.

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first six months of 2014 and 2013 are presented in the following table.  Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions) 2014 2013Net cash provided by (used in):   Operating activities$1,644 $1,643Investing activities(a)(681) (1,918)Financing activities(1,130) (1,516)Total$(167) $(1,791)(a) The six months ended June 30, 2013 includes the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. Net cash provided by operating activities remained flat in the first six months of 2014 compared to the first six months of 2013. Net income decreased $258 million for the first six months, but was partially offset by favorable changes in working capital period over period of $170 million. Changes in working capital were a net $92 million use of cash in the first six months of 2014 compared to a net $262 million use of cash in the first six months of 2013. The net $92 million use of cash in the first six months of 2014 was primarily due to increases in inventories and current receivables, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Changes from December 31, 2013 to June 30, 2014 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Inventories increased $932 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to an increase in crude oil inventory volumes. •Current receivables increased $166 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher crude oil and refined product prices, partially offset by lower outstanding refined product volumes. •Accounts payable increased $700 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher crude oil payable prices and volumes.37Table of ContentsThe net $262 million use of cash in the first six months of 2013 was primarily due to increases in current receivables and inventories, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Changes from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Current receivables increased $1.55 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes. •Inventories, excluding the impact of the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, increased $455 million from year-end 2012, primarily due to increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. •Accounts payable increased $1.82 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes related to the requirements of the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013 and lower crude oil purchases at the end of 2012 in preparation for turnaround and major maintenance activity. In addition, accounts payable increased from year-end 2012 due to higher crude oil prices at the end of the second quarter of 2013 compared to year-end 2012. Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of 2014 was $1.24 billion lower than the first six months of 2013, primarily due to the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets acquisition in February 2013, partially offset by higher capital expenditures in our Refining & Marketing segment in the first six months of 2014.The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows.

The uses of cash for both periods were primarily for common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plans and dividend payments, partially offset in the first six months of 2014 by net long-term debt borrowings by MPLX.Cash used in common stock repurchases in the first six months of 2014 was $165 million lower than the first six months of 2013. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases. See Note 7 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.

Cash used in dividend payments increased $16 million in the first six months of 2014 compared to the first six months of 2013, primarily due to an increase in our dividend payments of $0.14 per common share, from $0.70 per share to $0.84 per share, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases.Long-term debt borrowings and repayments was a net $244 million source of cash in the first six months of 2014 compared to a $10 million use of cash in the first six months of 2013. During the first six months of 2014, MPLX borrowed $270 million under its revolving credit agreement to fund the acquisition of an additional interest in Pipe Line Holdings and subsequently repaid $15 million. Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.Capital ResourcesOur liquidity totaled $5.93 billion at June 30, 2014 consisting of:  June 30, 2014(In millions) Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings AvailableCapacityRevolving credit agreement(a)$2,500 $— $2,500Trade receivables securitization facility1,300 — 1,300Total$3,800 $— $3,800Cash and cash equivalents    2,125Total liquidity    $5,925(a) Excludes MPLX’s $500 million revolving credit agreement, which had $245 million available as of June 30, 2014.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.Our revolving credit agreement (the “MPC Credit Agreement”) and the MPLX Credit Agreement contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of June 30, 2014, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.17 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPC Credit Agreement.39Table of ContentsThe financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). As of June 30, 2014, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 1.8 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of June 30, 2014, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.Rating AgencyRatingMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.Neither the MPC Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the MPC Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 25 percent at June 30, 2014 and 23 percent at December 31, 2013.(In millions)June 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Long-term debt due within one year$26 $23Long-term debt3,612 3,373Total debt$3,638 $3,396Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$3,638 $3,396Total equity11,037 11,332Total capital$14,675 $14,728Debt-to-total-capital ratio25% 23%Capital RequirementsWe have a capital and investment budget for 2014 of $2.43 billion, excluding capitalized interest and the pending acquisition of Hess Retail, as discussed below. The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, our capital expenditures and investments were $721 million, excluding capitalized interest. Other than the pending acquisition of Hess Retail, there have been no material changes to our 2014 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we may be required to pay to the seller a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In July 2014, we paid BP $180 million for the first period's contingent earnout. See Notes 4 and 13 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.40Table of ContentsOn May 21, 2014, Speedway entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Hess Corporation to purchase Hess Retail for total consideration of $2.874 billion, comprised of a cash purchase price of $2.37 billion, an estimated $230 million of net working capital and $274 million of capital lease obligations. The acquisition is expected to be funded with a combination of debt and available cash and is anticipated to close later this year, subject to customary closing conditions.MPLX had $255 million in borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit agreement at June 30, 2014.During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we made no contributions to our funded pension plans. We have no required funding for 2014, but may do so at our discretion.On July 30, 2014, our board of directors approved a $0.50 per share dividend, payable September 10, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 20, 2014.During the first six months of 2014, we paid $1.15 billion to acquire 13 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $87.82 per delivered share. At June 30, 2014, we also had agreements to repurchase additional common shares for $12 million, which were settled in early July 2014. As of June 30, 2014, we had an outstanding repurchase authorization of $709 million, which expires in September 2015. On July 30, 2014, our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization expiring in July 2016.We may utilize various methods to effect additional repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to share repurchase authorizations and the pending acquisition of Hess Retail. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. Factors that could affect the pending acquisition of Hess Retail include, but are not limited to, our ability to successfully complete the pending acquisition of Hess Retail, including, without limitation, the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Contractual Cash ObligationsAs of June 30, 2014, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first six months of 2014, contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment increased $2.37 billion, other purchase obligations increased $230 million and capital lease obligations increased $274 million due to the pending acquisition of Hess Retail. Additionally, the MPLX Credit Agreement committed payments increased $265 million due to outstanding borrowings on the MPLX Credit Agreement, including interest and fees. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.41Table of ContentsOur opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million ("ppm") beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards. There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the six months ended June 30, 2014.Critical Accounting EstimatesThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the six months ended June 30, 2014.Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedIn June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update for the elimination of the concept of development stage entity ("DSE") from U.S. GAAP and removes the related incremental reporting. The standards update eliminates the additional financial statement requirements specific to a DSE. In addition, it amends the consolidation model by eliminating the special provisions in the variable interest entity rules for assessing the sufficiency of the equity of a DSE. The portion of the accounting standards update related to the amendment to the consolidation guidance will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The portion of the accounting standards update related to the removal of the DSE reporting requirements will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of this standards update in the first quarters of 2015 and 2016 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.42Table of ContentsIn May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update for revenue recognition that is aligned with the International Accounting Standards Board's revenue recognition standard issued on the same day. The guidance in the update states that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service. Recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach including identifying the contract, identifying the separate performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations are satisfied. Additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized. The accounting standards update will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with no early adoption permitted. At this point, a final determination has not been made as to the impact of the adoption of this standards update in the first quarter of 2017. However, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that redefines the criteria for determining discontinued operations and introduces new disclosures related to these disposals. The updated definition of a discontinued operation is the disposal of a component(s) of an entity or the classification of a component(s) of an entity as held for sale that represents a strategic shift for an entity and has (or will have) a major impact on an entity's operations and financial results. The standard requires disclosure of additional financial information for discontinued operations and individually material components not qualifying for discontinued operation presentation, as well as information regarding an entity's continuing involvement with the discontinued operation. The accounting standards update is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this standards update in the first quarter of 2015 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.43Table of ContentsItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.See Notes 13 and 14 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of June 30, 2014 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after June 30, 2014 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt as of June 30, 2014 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(In millions) Fair Valueas ofJune 30, 2014(b) Change inFair Value Change in NetIncome for theSix Months EndedJune 30, 2014 Long-term debt(a)      Fixed-rate$3,436  $317(c)  n/a Variable-rate255 n/a 1(d) (a) Excludes capital leases.(b) Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(c) Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at June 30, 2014.(d) Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2014. At June 30, 2014, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.44Table of ContentsItem 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2014, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2014, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.45Table of ContentsSupplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  June 30, Six Months Ended  June 30,(In millions)2014 2013 2014 2013Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing$1,260 $903 $1,622 $2,008Speedway94 123 152 190Pipeline Transportation(a)81 58 153 109Items not allocated to segments:        Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(61) (64) (128) (131) Pension settlement expenses(5) (60) (69) (60)Income from operations$1,369 $960 $1,730 $2,116Capital Expenditures and Investments(b)(c)       Refining & Marketing$235 $134 $413 $1,554Speedway44 76 76 112Pipeline Transportation64 41 194 131Corporate and Other(d)20 32 51 60Total$363 $283 $734 $1,857(a) Corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX are included in the Pipeline Transportation segment.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.LitigationWe are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Environmental ProceedingsAs reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, in January 2011, the EPA notified us of alleged violations of various statutory and regulatory provisions related to motor fuels, some of which we had previously self-reported to the EPA. Subsequently, we self-reported four additional alleged Clean Air Act violations related to motor fuels to the EPA. As a result of these allegations, we recently agreed to pay a $2.75 million civil penalty as well as undertake certain projects to reduce environmental emissions. The complaint and final settlement decree are not yet finalized, but the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.We are involved in a number of other environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A.
