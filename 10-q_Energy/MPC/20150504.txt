Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail marketing and pipeline transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,750 convenience stores in 22 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,500 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. •Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX.24Table of Contents Executive SummaryResultsSelect results for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions, except per share data) 2015 2014Income from Operations by segment   Refining & Marketing$1,316 $362Speedway168 58Pipeline Transportation67 72Net income attributable to MPC$891 $199Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$3.24 $0.67Net income attributable to MPC was $891 million, or $3.24 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $199 million, or $0.67 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2014.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $954 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) and Chicago crack spreads and lower turnaround and other direct operating costs. Speedway segment income from operations increased $110 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to increases in our gasoline, distillate and merchandise gross margins, partially offset by higher operating expenses, all of which reflect the results of the recently acquired Hess convenience stores. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations decreased $5 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and lower pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher transportation revenue.MPLX LPWe own a 71.5 percent interest in MPLX, including the two percent general partner interest. Effective March 1, 2014, we sold MPLX a 13 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings for $310 million. MPLX financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit agreement. On December 1, 2014, we sold and contributed interests in Pipe Line Holdings totaling 30.5 percent to MPLX for $600 million in cash and 2.9 million MPLX common units valued at $200 million. MPLX financed the sales portion of this transaction with $600 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.On April 29, 2015, our board of directors authorized the sale of its marine business to MPLX. Subject to the approval of the MPLX board of directors, the negotiation of a definitive agreement and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the next several months. Upon completion, we will account for this sale as a transaction between entities under common control and will not record a gain or loss. On April 20, 2015, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.4100 per unit, totaling $37 million. This distribution will be paid on May 15, 2015. MPC’s portion of this cash distribution is approximately $27 million.On February 12, 2015, MPLX completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of MPLX Senior Notes. See Note 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information.25Table of Contents The following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during the first quarter of 2015 and 2014.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2015 2014Cash distributions received from MPLX:   General partner distributions, including incentive distribution rights$2 $1Limited partner distributions22 17Total$24 $18The market value of the 19,980,619 MPLX common units and 36,951,515 MPLX subordinated units we owned at March 31, 2015 was $4.2 billion based on the March 31, 2015 closing unit price of $73.26. Over time, we believe there will be substantial value attributable to our general partnership interests.Acquisitions and InvestmentsOn September 30, 2014, we acquired from Hess all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40,000 barrels per day on Colonial Pipeline for $2.82 billion. We refer to these assets as “Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets” and substantially all of these assets are part of our Speedway segment. This acquisition significantly expands our Speedway presence from nine to 22 states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow higher-valued, stable cash flow businesses. This acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for an incremental 200 mbpd of assured sales from our refining system. The transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for Hess’ Retail Operations and Related Assets. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition.In July 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.’s SAX pipeline through our investment in Illinois Extension Pipeline. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we made contributions of $37 million to Illinois Extension Pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs for the SAX project. We have contributed $157 million since project inception. In March 2014, we acquired from Chevron Raven Ridge Pipe Line Company an additional seven percent interest in Explorer for $77 million, bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent. Due to this increase in our ownership percentage, we now account for our investment in Explorer using the equity method of accounting and report Explorer as a related party. Explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Hammond, Indiana.See Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information regarding our future contributions to the SAX pipeline project.Share RepurchasesAs of March 31, 2015, our board of directors had approved $8.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations. Since January 1, 2012, we have repurchased a total of $6.48 billion of our common stock, leaving $1.52 billion available for repurchases. Through March 31, 2015, we have acquired 92 million shares at an average cost per share of $70.95 under these authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. LiquidityAs of March 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.08 billion, an unused $2.5 billion revolving credit agreement, and $978 million of availability under our $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility based on eligible trade receivables. At March 31, 2015, MPLX had no borrowings and no letters of credit outstanding under its $1 billion credit agreement. Employees New collective bargaining agreements for the hourly refinery workers at our Canton, Catlettsburg and Texas City refineries were ratified in March and April, 2015, and are scheduled to expire on January 31, 2019 in Canton and Catlettsburg, and March 31, 2019 in Texas City. The labor agreement for our Galveston Bay refinery expired on January 31, 2015 and no successor agreement has been finalized. The work stoppage continues at this facility. 26Table of Contents Stock Split On April 29, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend, which will be distributed on June 10, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2015. The total number of authorized common shares and common stock par value remain unchanged. The stock split will require retroactive restatement of all historical shares and per share data beginning in the second quarter ending June 30, 2015. All shares and per share data information included in this report are presented on a pre-split basis. The pro forma basic earnings per share on a post-split basis were $1.63 and $0.34 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, respectively, and diluted earnings per share were $1.62 and $0.34 for the same time periods. The stock is expected to trade on a split-adjusted basis beginning June 11, 2015.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the estimated construction costs and completion of the SAX pipeline project and the share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the estimated construction costs, timing and completion of the SAX pipeline project, include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. Light Louisiana Sweet (“LLS”) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like Brent crude. In recent years, domestic U.S. crude oils, such as West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) and LLS, traded at prices less than Brent due to the growth in U.S. crude oil production, logistical constraints and other market factors. These price discounts compared to Brent favorably impacted the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. During 2011 and continuing through the first half of 2013, WTI traded at prices significantly less than Brent and LLS, which favorably impacted our Refining & Marketing gross margin. The differential between WTI and LLS significantly narrowed during the second half of 2013 with a further narrowing broadly continuing until late 2014. Since late 2014, LLS has seen volatile differentials to both WTI and Brent. The spread between domestic crude oils and Brent could narrow if there is a change in existing U.S. energy policy regarding crude oil exports, or if low crude oil prices reduce U.S. crude oil production growth substantially. If either were to occur, it could reduce our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.27Table of Contents The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax)  LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)$450Sweet/sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)200LLS-WTI differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)100Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change)140(a) Weighted 38 percent Chicago and 62 percent USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.(b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].(c) Assumes 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;•our refinery yields;•the selling prices realized for refined products;•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; •the cost of products purchased for resale; •the potential impact of lower of cost or market adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices; and•the impact of liquidations of last in, first out (“LIFO”) inventory layers with costs significantly above current market prices.Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The cost of our crude oil and refined product inventories is determined under the LIFO method. During periods of rapidly declining prices, the LIFO cost basis of our crude oil and refined product inventories may have to be written down to market value. During the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a permanent reduction in our refined product inventories for LIFO accounting purposes. The cost of these inventories was based on prices in early 2014, which were much higher than current prices. As a result, we recognized a pre-tax charge of approximately $30 million in connection with this LIFO inventory reduction.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. We had significantly less planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Galveston Bay, Texas and Garyville, Louisiana refineries during the first quarter of 2015 compared to activities at our Galveston Bay, Texas; Garyville, Louisiana; Robinson, Illinois and Catlettsburg, Kentucky refineries during the first quarter of 2014. SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway’s gross margin. During the first quarter of 2015, approximately half of Speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales as compared to two-thirds during the same period in 2014. This change is the result of higher light product gross margins during the first quarter of 2015 and the effect of the recently acquired Hess convenience stores. Speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.28Table of Contents Pipeline TransportationThe profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2015 2014 VarianceRevenues and other income:     Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$17,191 $23,285 $(6,094)Income from equity method investments15 35 (20)Net gain on disposal of assets5 1 4Other income29 24 5Total revenues and other income17,240 23,345 (6,105)Costs and expenses:     Cost of revenues (excludes items below)13,044 20,540 (7,496)Purchases from related parties76 159 (83)Consumer excise taxes1,832 1,515 317Depreciation and amortization363 320 43Selling, general and administrative expenses358 346 12Other taxes97 104 (7)Total costs and expenses15,770 22,984 (7,214)Income from operations1,470 361 1,109Net interest and other financial income (costs)(81) (46) (35)Income before income taxes1,389 315 1,074Provision for income taxes486 108 378Net income903 207 696Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests12 8 4Net income attributable to MPC$891 $199 $692Net income attributable to MPC increased $692 million in the first  quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations, which increased $954 million in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Additionally, our Speedway segment income increased $110 million during the same period. The increase in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was primarily due to higher USGC and Chicago crack spreads and lower turnaround and other direct operating costs while the increase in Speedway segment income is a result of higher light product and merchandise margins, partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses, all of which reflect the results of the recently acquired Hess convenience stores.29Table of Contents Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $6.1 billion in the first quarter of 2015  compared to first quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil sales prices partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes.Income from equity method investments decreased $20 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to decreases in income from our ethanol affiliates of $18 million.Net gain on disposal of assets increased $4 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to the sale of a terminal.Other income increased $5 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to higher gains on sales of excess Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”). Cost of revenues decreased $7.50 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily due to:•a decrease in refined product cost of sales of $7.42 billion primarily due to a decrease in raw material costs, partially offset by an increase in refined product sales volumes; and •a decrease in refinery direct operating costs, including costs associated with significant planned turnaround activity in the first quarter of 2014, of $503 million, or $4.18 per barrel of total refinery throughput. Purchases from related parties decreased $83 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to:•decreases in volumes purchased from LOOP and Centennial of $40 million and $9 million, respectively; and•decreases in prices for ethanol purchases from TAME and TACE of $14 million and $11 million, respectively. Depreciation and amortization increased $43 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to depreciation of the assets acquired from Hess by our Speedway segment and projects placed into service in the Refining & Marketing segment.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $12 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to increases in salaries and wages of $41 million, contract services of $24 million and employee benefit costs of $11 million, partially offset by a decrease in pension settlement expenses of $63 million. Excluding pension settlement expenses, these increases in selling, general and administrative expenses reflect the acquisition of convenience stores from Hess. We recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $64 million in the first quarter of 2014 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during these periods.Other taxes decreased $7 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in sales and use taxes and other tax expenses of $15 million, offset by increases in property taxes of $8 million. The decreases in sales and use taxes and other tax expenses were primarily attributable to tax credits received in the first quarter of 2015 and reduced turnaround and maintenance work at various refineries. The increase in property taxes was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the Hess assets.Provision for income taxes increased $378 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to an increase of $1.07 billion in income before income taxes. The effective tax rates for the first quarter of both 2015 and 2014 are equivalent to or slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. 30Table of Contents Segment ResultsRevenues, including intersegment sales, are summarized by segment in the following table.

The increase in gasoline and distillate sales was primarily due to a volume increase of 659 million gallons, primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores, partially offset by a decrease in average gasoline and distillate selling prices of $1.09 per gallon. The increase in merchandise sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores. The number of convenience stores increased primarily due to the acquisition of convenience stores from Hess on September 30, 2014.The following table includes certain revenue statistics for the Speedway segment.

The result was a positive impact on segment income of $66 million. •The LLS-WTI crude oil differential narrowed $1.45 per barrel in 2015 compared to 2014, which had a negative impact on segment income of $31 million.The above market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and products sold. Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, mix and crude costs as well as other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had estimated negative impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income of $104 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

The decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs was primarily attributable the Galveston Bay refinery, which incurred significant turnaround costs in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to lower costs for energy, catalyst and routine maintenance. We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with purchased RINs decreased to $41 million in the first quarter of 2015 from $71 million in the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to the lower average cost of biodiesel RINs in the first quarter of 2015 as compared to the first quarter of 2014. The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment. Three Months Ended  March 31, 2015 2014Gasoline & distillate gross margin (dollars per gallon)(a)$0.1970 $0.1156Merchandise gross margin (in millions)$311 $192Merchandise gross margin percent28.0% 26.5%(a) The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, divided by gasoline and distillate sales volume.Speedway segment income from operations increased $110 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014. The increase in segment income was primarily due to an increase in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $193 million, or $0.0814 per gallon, and an increase in our merchandise gross margin of $119 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Gasoline, distillate and merchandise gross margins along with operating expenses were higher primarily due to the results of the acquired convenience stores from Hess. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations decreased $5 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to an increase in various operating expenses and lower pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher transportation revenue.Corporate and other unallocated items increased $13 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, largely due to lower allocated employee benefit costs. We recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $1 million in the first quarter of 2015 and $64 million in the first quarter of 2014 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during these periods.34Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $2.08 billion at March 31, 2015 compared to $1.49 billion at December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 are presented in the following table.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2015 2014Net cash provided by (used in):   Operating activities$1,190 $766Investing activities(388) (360)Financing activities(218) (532)Total$584 $(126)Net cash provided by operating activities increased $424 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014 primarily due to an increase in net income of $696 million partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $180 million. Changes in working capital were a net $55 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2015 compared to a net $125 million source of cash in the first quarter of 2014. The net $55 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventory. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt. Changes from December 31, 2014 to March 31, 2015 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable decreased $1.27 billion from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil prices.•Current receivables decreased $694 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil prices. •Inventories decreased $205 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to decreases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. The net $125 million source of cash from working capital changes in the first quarter of 2014 was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in inventories. Changes from December 31, 2013 to March 31, 2014 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable increased $1.08 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes and prices at the end of the first quarter 2014 compared to year-end 2013. •Inventories increased $1.00 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to an increase in crude oil inventory volumes. •Current receivables decreased $139 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable volumes, partially offset by higher refined product and crude oil prices. Net cash used in investing activities was $28 million higher in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to an increase in additions to property, plant and equipment, partially offset by a decrease in investments in affiliates.The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows.

Net cash used in equity method investments decreased $82 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to our acquisition of an additional seven percent interest in Explorer for $77 million and contributions to North Dakota Pipeline of $37 million to fund our portion of the Sandpiper pipeline project in the first quarter of 2014, as compared to our contribution to Illinois Extension Pipeline of $37 million to fund the SAX pipeline project in the first quarter of 2015. Financing activities were a net $218 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2015 compared to a net $532 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2014. The uses of cash for both periods included common stock repurchases under our share repurchase authorizations and dividend payments offset by sources of cash from net borrowing activity. Long-term debt borrowings and repayments were a net $107 million source of cash in the first quarter of 2015 compared to a net $264 million source of cash in the first quarter of 2014. During the first quarter of 2015, MPLX used proceeds from its $500 million of MPLX Senior Notes to repay amounts outstanding under the MPLX Credit Agreement, as well as for general partnership purposes. During the first quarter of 2014, MPLX borrowed $270 million under its revolving credit facility to fund MPLX’s acquisition of an additional interest in Pipe Line Holdings.Cash used in common stock repurchases decreased $480 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase authorizations.

Our dividend payments were $0.50 per common share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.42 per common share in the first quarter of 2014.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.36Table of Contents Capital ResourcesOur liquidity totaled $5.56 billion at March 31, 2015 consisting of:  March 31, 2015(In millions) Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings AvailableCapacityRevolving credit agreement(a)$2,500 $— $2,500Trade receivables securitization facility(b)978 — 978Total$3,478 $— $3,478Cash and cash equivalents    2,078Total liquidity    $5,556(a) Excludes MPLX’s $1 billion revolving credit agreement, which had $1 billion available as of March 31, 2015.(b) Availability under our $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility is a function of refined product selling prices, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment. As of April 30, 2015, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $747 million.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.The MPC term loan agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”), MPC Credit Agreement and MPLX Credit Agreement contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of March 31, 2015, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.30 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. As of March 31, 2015, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.3 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of March 31, 2015, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.Rating AgencyRatingMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook)FitchBBB (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.Neither the Term Loan Agreement, MPC Credit Agreement, MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the Term Loan Agreement, the MPC Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.37Table of Contents Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 36 percent at March 31, 2015 and 37 percent at December 31, 2014.(In millions)March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014Long-term debt due within one year$776 $27Long-term debt5,967 6,610Total debt$6,743 $6,637Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$6,743 $6,637Total equity11,980 11,390Total capital$18,723 $18,027Debt-to-total-capital ratio36% 37%Capital RequirementsWe have a capital and investment budget for 2015 of $2.53 billion, excluding capitalized interest. The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, our capital expenditures and investments were $376 million, excluding capitalized interest. There have been no material changes to our 2015 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.During 2014, we worked on a front-end engineering and design study and procured certain long lead time items for a residual fuel hydrocracker project at our Garyville refinery, with estimated total costs of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion, intended to increase margins by upgrading residual fuel to ULSD and gas oil. We are deferring a final investment decision on this project as we further evaluate the implications of current market conditions on the project. As of March 31, 2015, we have capitalized $136 million of costs associated with this project. If a decision is made to not pursue this project, there could be a future impairment of the costs incurred for the project.Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we may be required to pay the seller a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In July 2014, we paid $180 million for the first year’s contingent earnout and we expect to pay approximately $189 million in 2015. See Note 14 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the first quarter of 2015. At March 31, 2015, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If market conditions were to change and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of March 31, 2015, our equity investment in Centennial was $36 million and we had a $37 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial’s outstanding debt. See Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we did not make any contributions to our funded pension plans. While we have no required contributions, we may make additional contributions to our funded pension plans in 2015 depending on the anticipated funding status and plan asset performance.On April 29, 2015, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.50 per share on common stock on a pre-split basis. The dividend is payable June 10, 2015, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 20, 2015. During the first three months of 2015, we paid $209 million to acquire 2 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $95.03 per delivered share. At March 31, 2015, we also had agreements to repurchase additional common shares for $9 million, which were settled in April 2015. As of March 31, 2015, we had $1.52 billion of remaining repurchase authorization. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.38Table of Contents We may utilize various methods to effect additional repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to a decision on the residual fuel hydrocracker project at our Garyville refinery, the contingent earnout payment to the seller of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment, future contributions to our funded pension plans and share repurchase authorizations. Forward-looking statements about our capital requirements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking statements regarding capital requirements include the availability of liquidity, business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets, market price of our common stock, prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Contractual Cash Obligations As of March 31, 2015, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first three months of 2015, our long-term debt commitments increased $286 million. The increase was due to the issuance of MPLX senior notes, partially offset by the repayment of the MPLX Credit Agreement. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.39Table of Contents Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million (“ppm”) beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards. There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2015.Critical Accounting EstimatesThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2015.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsIn June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update for the elimination of the concept of DSE from U.S. GAAP and removes the related incremental reporting. The standards update eliminates the additional financial statement requirements specific to a DSE and was adopted in the first quarter of 2015. In addition, the portion to amend the consolidation model that eliminates the special provisions in the VIE rules for assessing the sufficiency of the equity of a DSE is effective in the first quarter of 2016. Adoption of this standard update in the first quarter of 2015 and 2016 has not and is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that redefines the criteria for determining discontinued operations and introduces new disclosures related to these disposals. The updated definition of a discontinued operation is the disposal of a component (or components) of an entity or the classification of a component (or components) of an entity as held for sale that represents a strategic shift for an entity and has (or will have) a major impact on an entity’s operations and financial results. The standard requires disclosure of additional financial information for discontinued operations and individually material components not qualifying for discontinued operation presentation, as well as information regarding an entity’s continuing involvement with the discontinued operation. The accounting standards update was effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. Adoption of this standards update in the first quarter of 2015 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedIn April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update clarifying whether a customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as an acquisition of a software license or as a service arrangement by providing characteristics that a cloud computing arrangement must have in order to be accounted for as a software license acquisition. The change is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Retrospective or prospective application is allowed and early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.In April 2015, the FASB issued an update to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The update requires that all debt issue costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct reduction of the liability. The change is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Retrospective application is required and early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.40Table of Contents In February 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update making targeted changes to the current consolidation guidance. The new standard changes the way certain decisions are made related to substantive rights, related parties, and decision making fees when applying the VIE consolidation model and eliminates certain guidance for limited partnerships and similar entities under the voting interest consolidation model. The update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. At this point, we have not determined the impact of the new standards update on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update requiring management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Management will be required to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether management’s plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt. The accounting standards update will be effective for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted. In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update for revenue recognition that is aligned with the International Accounting Standards Board’s revenue recognition standard issued on the same day. The guidance in the update states that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service. Recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach including identifying the contract, identifying the separate performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations are satisfied. Additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized. The accounting standards update will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with no early adoption permitted. At this point, we have not determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 41Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.See Notes 14 and 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of March 31, 2015 is provided in the following table.

At March 31, 2015, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX term loan agreement. There were no borrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2015. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX Credit Agreement, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.42Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2015, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2015, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.43Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions)2015 2014Income from Operations by segment   Refining & Marketing$1,316 $362Speedway168 58Pipeline Transportation(a)67 72Items not allocated to segments:    Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(80) (67) Pension settlement expenses(1) (64)Income from operations$1,470 $361Capital Expenditures and Investments(b)   Refining & Marketing$229 $178Speedway45 32Pipeline Transportation81 130Corporate and Other(c)29 31Total$384 $371(a) Corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX are included in the Pipeline Transportation segment.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.LitigationWe are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Environmental ProceedingsAs reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, we have been subject to a pending enforcement matter with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois attorney general’s office since 2002 concerning self-reporting of possible emission exceedences and permitting issues related to storage tanks at the Robinson, Illinois refinery. As a result of these allegations, we settled with the agency in April 2015 and agreed to pay a $95,000 civil penalty and undertake a supplemental environmental project involving the installation of ambient air monitors at the refinery. We are involved in a number of other environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A.
