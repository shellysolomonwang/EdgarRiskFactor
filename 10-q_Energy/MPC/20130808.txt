Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.  Corporate Overview  We are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered.  Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer.        •    Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway business segment and to dealers and jobbers who operate Marathon® retail outlets;        •    Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway® convenience stores; and        •    Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX and MPC’s retained pipeline assets and investments.  Executive Summary  Net income attributable to MPC was $593 million and $1.32 billion, or $1.83 and $4.01 per diluted share, for the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to $814 million and $1.41 billion, or $2.38 and $4.07 per diluted share, for the second quarter and first six months of 2012. The decreases were primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment, which generated income from operations of $903 million and $2.01 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to $1.33 billion and $2.27 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2012.  The decreases in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations were primarily due to lower refining and marketing gross margins, which were $6.18 per barrel and $6.99 per barrel in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to $11.13 per barrel and $9.76 per barrel in the second quarter and first six months of 2012. These impacts were partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013.    29    Table of Contents Speedway segment income from operations increased $16 million and $33 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin and our merchandise gross margin, partially offset by higher expenses attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores.  Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $8 million and $17 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012. The increases primarily reflect higher transportation tariffs, partially offset by higher operating, including mechanical integrity, and depreciation expenses.  On February 1, 2013, we paid $1.49 billion to acquire from BP the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, an allocation of BP’s Colonial Pipeline Company shipper history, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites and a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility, as well as the inventory associated with these assets. We refer to these assets as the “Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets”. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Information for periods prior to the acquisition does not include amounts for these operations. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition.  On January 30, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The board also extended the remaining $650 million share repurchase authorization announced on February 1, 2012, for a total outstanding authorization of $2.65 billion through December 2014. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we paid $1.31 billion to repurchase our common shares, and received 17 million common shares through open market share repurchases and the final shares received under our November 2012 ASR program. The effective average cost was $80.54 per delivered share. At June 30, 2013, we also had agreements to repurchase additional common shares for $36 million, which were settled in early July 2013.  Overview of Segments  Refining & Marketing  Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining and marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.  Our refining and marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and refinery direct operating costs, including turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil (“LLS”) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent sulfur residual fuel) are used for these crack-spread calculations.  Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our refining and marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and marketing gross margin.    30    Table of Contents Historically, West Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”) has traded at prices similar to LLS. During the first six months of 2012 and in early 2013, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our refining and marketing gross margin. Logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets and other market factors acted to keep the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions. However, the differential between WTI and LLS significantly narrowed in the second quarter of 2013 due to a variety of domestic and international market conditions along with changes in logistical infrastructure. Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors.  The following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.             (In millions, after-tax)         LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity (a) (per $1.00/barrel change)   $ 425     Sweet/sour differential sensitivity (b) (per $1.00/barrel change)     225     LLS-WTI spread sensitivity (c) (per $1.00/barrel change)     75     Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change)     140        (a)   Weighted 38% Chicago and 62% USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.    (b)   LLS (prompt)—[delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].    (c)   Assumes 20% of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.  In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our refining and marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:        •    the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;        •    the selling prices realized for refined products;        •    the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;        •    the cost of products purchased for resale; and        •    changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses.  Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. We had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Garyville, Louisiana; and Galveston Bay refineries during the first six months of 2013 compared to activities at our Garyville and Robinson, Illinois refineries during the first six months of 2012.  Speedway  Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile. Approximately two-thirds of Speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in the second quarter and first six months of 2013.    31    Table of Contents Pipeline Transportation  The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. In the fourth quarter of 2012, new transportation services agreements were entered into between MPC and MPLX, which resulted in higher tariff rates. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillates peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.

These impacts were partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013.    32    Table of Contents Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $5.44 billion in the second quarter and $8.50 billion in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes, which increased to 2,135 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) and 2,016 mbpd in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 from 1,591 mbpd and 1,574 mbpd in the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013. This impact was partially offset by decreases in refined product selling prices.  Other income increased $14 million in the second quarter and $22 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to increases in sales of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) and dividends received from pipeline affiliates.  Cost of revenues increased $5.52 billion in the second quarter and $8.23 billion in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012. The increases were primarily due to increases in purchased crude oil volumes in the Refining & Marketing segment. Crude oil volumes increased 40 percent in the second quarter and 32 percent in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily associated with the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013.  Purchases from related parties increased $22 million in the second quarter and $31 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to higher acquisition costs of ethanol from our ethanol investments due to increases in ethanol volumes purchased and higher ethanol prices, partially offset by a decrease in purchases from Centennial in the first six months of 2013.  Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that continued through the first six months of 2013. At June 30, 2013, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial and concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on various uses of Centennial’s assets.  Consumer excise taxes increased $168 million in the second quarter and $246 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the same periods of 2012, primarily due to the increase in refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013.  Depreciation and amortization increased $66 million in the second quarter and $123 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan refinery and our acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.  Other taxes increased $24 million in the second quarter and $39 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to increases in personal property taxes and payroll taxes. These increases were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery, the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets and Speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012.  Net interest and other financial costs increased $28 million in the second quarter and $54 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily reflecting a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project in late 2012. We capitalized interest of $4 million in the second quarter and $8 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to $36 million in the second quarter and $66 million in the first six months of 2012.  Provision for income taxes decreased $160 million in the second quarter and $120 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to the $375 million and $201 million decreases in income before income taxes and decreases in the effective tax rates, which were 35 percent and 34 percent in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to 37 percent in the same periods of 2012. The effective tax rates in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 is equivalent to or slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, partially offset by state and local tax expense.

Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 745 million gallons in the second quarter and 1.43 billion gallons in the first six months of 2013 compared to 678 million gallons in the second quarter and 1.29 billion gallons in the first six months of 2012, with the increased volumes primarily due to Speedway’s acquisitions of convenience stores in 2013 and 2012.  Speedway segment revenues increased $136 million in the second quarter and $293 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to increases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes of 25 million gallons and 64 million gallons, respectively. Gasoline and distillate selling prices averaged $3.63 per gallon and $3.57 per gallon in    34    Table of Contents  the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to $3.62 per gallon and $3.57 per gallon in the second quarter and first six months of 2012. The Speedway segment also had higher merchandise sales in the second quarter and first six months of 2013. The increases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and merchandise sales were primarily due to the acquisitions of convenience stores in 2013 and 2012.  Pipeline Transportation segment revenue increased $29 million in the second quarter and $55 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to higher transportation tariffs from our crude oil pipelines, resulting from higher crude oil volumes transported and increased tariff rates in the last half of 2012. Crude oil pipeline throughput volumes increased 141 mbpd in the second quarter and 146 mbpd for the six months of 2013 compared to the corresponding 2012 periods.

Our realized Refining & Marketing gross margin for the second quarter and first six months of 2013 benefited from increases in the Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread of $1.39 per barrel and $1.68 per barrel, respectively. However, we experienced lower product price realizations compared to the spot market product prices used in the LLS crack spread calculation. We believe the product price realizations were impacted by volatility in the Chicago market and compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS2”). In addition, our average crude oil acquisition discount narrowed compared to LLS in 2013. These impacts were partially offset by increases in refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013.  The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 52 percent and 53 percent of our crude oil processed in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to 54 percent and 50 percent in the same periods of 2012.  The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment.

(b)   Per barrel of total refinery throughputs.    (c)   Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs.    (d)   Includes intersegment sales.  Refinery direct operating costs in the Refining & Marketing gross margin increased $0.75 per barrel and $0.76 per barrel of total refinery throughputs in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 compared to the same periods of 2012, which includes increases in other manufacturing costs of $1.01 per barrel and $0.83 per barrel, respectively. The increases were primarily attributable to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery, which had higher operating costs per barrel of throughput than the average of our other six refineries due to its greater level of complexity.    36    Table of Contents We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS compliance. Our cost of purchasing RINs increased to $65 million and $107 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013 from $34 million and $66 million in the same periods of 2012, primarily due to higher ethanol RIN prices.  Speedway segment income from operations increased $16 million in the second quarter and $33 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012, primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin and our merchandise gross margin, partially offset by higher expenses attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores. The increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin were primarily due to $0.0099 and $0.0148 increases in our gross margin per gallon along with higher sales volumes related to the increase in the number of convenience stores. The increases in the merchandise gross margin were primarily due to higher merchandise sales resulting from an increase in the number of convenience stores.  The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Speedway segment.

Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $8 million in the second quarter and $17 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012. The increases primarily reflect higher transportation tariffs, partially offset by higher operating, including mechanical integrity, and depreciation expenses.  Corporate and other unallocated expenses decreased $28 million in the second quarter and $40 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2012. The decreases were primarily due to a reduction in net employee benefit expenses, including lower pension expenses resulting from a pension plan amendment adopted in May 2012.  During the second quarter of 2013, we recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $60 million resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions occurring during the first six months of 2013, compared to $83 million during the second quarter of 2012.    37    Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash Flows  Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $3.07 billion at June 30, 2013 compared to $4.86 billion at December 31, 2012. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first six months of 2013 and 2012 are presented in the following table.                    Six Months EndedJune 30,     (In millions)   2013     2012     Net cash provided by (used in):             Operating activities   $ 1,643     $ 616     Investing activities     (1,918 )      (798 )    Financing activities     (1,516 )      (1,002 )                          Total   $ (1,791 )    $ (1,184 )                         Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.03 billion in the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012, primarily due to favorable changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were a net $262 million use of cash in the first six months of 2013 compared to a net $1.86 billion use of cash in the first six months of 2012. The $262 million use of cash in the first six months of 2013 was primarily due to increases in current receivables and crude oil and refined product inventory volumes, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Current receivables increased $1.55 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes. Changes in inventories were a $455 million use of cash in the first six months of 2013, primarily due to increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. Accounts payable increased $1.82 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes related to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery in the first quarter of 2013 and lower crude oil purchases at the end of 2012 in preparation for turnaround and major maintenance activity. In addition, accounts payable increased due to higher crude oil prices at the end of the second quarter of 2013 compared to year-end 2012. The $1.86 billion use of cash in the first six months of 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from decreases in crude oil payable volumes and prices, and an increase in inventories resulting primarily from increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was a decrease in accounts receivable primarily caused by lower crude oil receivable volumes and prices.  Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.92 billion in the first six months of 2013, compared to $798 million in the first six months of 2012. The higher use of cash in the first six months of 2013 was primarily due to the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets acquisition in February 2013, partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2013 due to the completion of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project in late 2012.  The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash.

See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.    (b)   Includes acquisitions of 9 convenience stores in 2013 and 87 convenience stores in 2012.    (c)   Includes $70 million in 2013 for the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.    (d)   Includes capitalized interest of $8 million and $66 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  The acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets comprised 74 percent of our total capital spending in the first six months of 2013. The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, which we completed in 2012, comprised 60 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in the first six months of 2012.  Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1.52 billion in the first six months of 2013 and $1.00 billion in the first six months of 2012. The uses of cash for both periods were primarily for common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plans and dividend payments.  Cash used in common stock repurchases under the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors increased $463 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012. During the first six months of 2013, we paid $1.31 billion to repurchase 16 million common shares through open market repurchases compared to $850 million paid to repurchase 18 million shares under an ASR program during the six months of 2012. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.  Cash used in dividend payments increased $57 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012, primarily due to a 10 cent per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our dividend payments totaled 70 cents per common share in the first six months of 2013 compared to 50 cents per common share in the first six months of 2012.  Derivative Instruments  See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.    39    Table of Contents Capital Resources  As of June 30, 2013, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreements or our trade receivables securitization facility and our liquidity totaled $6.57 billion consisting of:                June 30,     (In millions)   2013     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 3,069     Revolving credit agreement(a)     2,500     Trade receivables securitization facility     1,000                 Total   $ 6,569                    (a)  Excludes MPLX’s $500 million revolving credit agreement, which was also undrawn.  Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.  Our revolving credit agreement (the “MPC Credit Agreement”) and MPLX’s revolving credit agreement (the “MPLX Credit Agreement”) contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of June 30, 2013, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.10 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPC Credit Agreement.  The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). As of June 30, 2013, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 0.1 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.  Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of June 30, 2013, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.           Rating Agency     Rating    Moody’s   Baa2 (positive outlook)   Standard & Poor’s   BBB (stable outlook)  The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.  Neither the MPC Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the MPC Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post a letter of credit under an existing transportation services agreement.    40    Table of Contents Debt-to-Total-Capital Ratio  Our debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 22 percent at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. There have been no material changes to our 2013 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.  Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we may be required to pay to the seller a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  During the six months ended June 30, 2013, we made contributions of $158 million to our funded pension plans. We may make additional contributions to our funded pension plans in 2013 depending on the anticipated funding status and plan asset performance.  On July 31, 2013, our board of directors approved a 42 cents per share dividend, payable September 10, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 21, 2013.  On January 30, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The board also extended the remaining $650 million share repurchase authorization for a total outstanding authorization of $2.65 billion through December 2014. During the first six months of 2013, the final shares from the $500 million ASR program were delivered to us and we paid $1.31 billion to acquire 16 million common shares through open market share repurchases. During the second quarter of 2013, we also entered into agreements to acquire additional common shares for $36 million, which were settled in early July 2013. At June 30, 2013, the initial $2.0 billion repurchase authorization announced on February 1, 2012 and extended on January 30, 2013 had been exhausted. As of June 30, 2013, we had a total outstanding repurchase authorization pursuant to the additional $2.0 billion repurchase authorization announced on January 30, 2013 of approximately $1.34 billion through December 2014.  We may utilize various methods to effect additional repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, ASRs or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.  The above discussion of the share repurchase authorization includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.    41    Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations  The following table provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of June 30, 2013.

(b)   Includes both short- and long-term purchases obligations.    (c)   These contracts include variable price arrangements with estimated prices to be paid primarily based on current market conditions. We are in the process of implementing systems that will allow us to estimate prices based on futures curves, which as of June 30, 2013, has been implemented for contracts with purchase obligations of $1.17 billion.    (d)   Includes obligations to advance funds to equity method investees.    (e)   Includes $700 million of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.    (f)   Primarily includes contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.    (g)   Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2022. See Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.  We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital    42    Table of Contents  resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.  Transactions with Related Parties  We believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.  Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs  We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.  On January 25, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit vacated the 2012 cellulosic biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. In light of this ruling, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is reconsidering and is anticipated to lower the 2011 and has subsequently eliminated the 2012 cellulosic biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. The EPA also has proposed a rule establishing a quality assurance program for RINs purchased to help meet the annual biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. This rule should be finalized later this year and is aimed at reducing the chances that RINs are fraudulently created or sold.  On March 29, 2013, the EPA announced its proposed Tier 3 fuel standards. The proposed Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million beginning in calendar year 2017. MPC and its trade organizations have submitted public comments on the standards and the agency is expected to finalize the Tier 3 fuel standards later this year. Our cost of compliance may be material; however, we will likely not be able to reasonably estimate our compliance costs until we have had time to review the final standards and develop our compliance plans.  There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the six months ended June 30, 2013.  Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The following critical accounting estimates have been updated since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 was filed.    43    Table of Contents Fair Value Estimates  Acquisitions  In accounting for business combinations, acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other assets and liabilities. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance.  The fair value of assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity specific differences. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions.  Derivatives  We record all derivative instruments at fair value. All of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value.  Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  As of June 30, 2013, there are no accounting standards that have not yet been adopted.    44    Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.  See Notes 15 and 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.  Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of June 30, 2013 is provided in the following table.                            Incremental Changein IFO from aHypothetical PriceIncrease of     Incremental Changein IFO from aHypothetical PriceDecrease of     (In millions)   10%     25%     10%     25%     As of June 30, 2013                       Crude   $ (162 )    $ (402 )    $ 175     $ 434     Refined products     (25 )      (58 )      28       69    We remain at risk for possible changes in the market value of commodity derivative instruments; however, such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying physical commodity. Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.  We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after June 30, 2013 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.  Sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point shift in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2013 is provided in the following table.                 (In millions)   FairValue     IncrementalChange inFair Value     Financial assets (liabilities)(a)             Long-term debt(b)   $ (3,322 ) (c)    $ (311 ) (d)       (a)   Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.    (b)   Excludes capital leases.    (c)   Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.    (d)   Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at June 30, 2013.  At June 30, 2013, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments. Therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value.    45    Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2013, the end of the period covered by this report.  Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the quarter ended June 30, 2013, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    46    Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited)                            Three Months Ended     Six Months Ended        June 30,     June 30,     (In millions)   2013     2012     2013     2012     Income from Operations by segment                       Refining & Marketing   $ 903     $ 1,325     $ 2,008     $ 2,268     Speedway     123       107       190       157     Pipeline Transportation(a)     58       50       109       92     Items not allocated to segments:                       Corporate and other unallocated items(a)     (64 )      (92 )      (131 )      (171 )    Pension settlement expenses     (60 )      (83 )      (60 )      (83 )                                              Income from operations   $ 960     $ 1,307     $ 2,116     $ 2,263                                               Capital Expenditures and Investments(b)(c)                       Refining & Marketing   $ 134     $ 178     $ 1,554     $ 331     Speedway(d)     76       187       112       198     Pipeline Transportation     41       60       131       98     Corporate and Other(e)     32       56       60       94                                               Total   $ 283     $ 481     $ 1,857     $ 721                                                  (a)   Included in the Pipeline Transportation segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 are $5 million and $10 million, respectively, of corporate overhead costs attributable to MPLX, which were included in items not allocated to segments prior to MPLX’s October 31, 2012 initial public offering.

Legal Proceedings  We are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment.  Litigation  We are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Environmental Proceedings  We are involved in a number of environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
