Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream services company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.8 million barrels per calendar day. We are in the process of fully integrating two of our refineries, Galveston Bay and Texas City, into one complex called the Galveston Bay Refinery. We expect to complete this integration by the end of this year. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Northeast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,730 convenience stores in 21 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,600 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 20 states and the District of Columbia.Through our ownership interests in MPLX and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MarkWest, we believe we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the United States, the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions and we distribute refined products through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets. Our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. Our assets include approximately 5.9 bcf/d of gathering capacity, 7.8 bcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 570 mbpd of fractionation capacity. We own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 10,800 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines, an inland marine business and one of the largest light product terminal operations in the United States to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products from our refineries to wholesale and retail market areas. In the first quarter of 2017, we revised our segment reporting in connection with the contribution of certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX. The operating results for these assets are now reported in our Midstream segment. Previously, they were reported as part of our Refining & Marketing segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised presentation. The results for the pipeline and storage assets were recast effective January 1, 2015 and the results for the terminal assets were recast effective April 1, 2016. Prior to these dates, these assets were not considered businesses for accounting purposes and, therefore, there are no financial results from which to recast segment results. Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including pipeline and marine transportation, terminal and storage services provided by our Midstream segment. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.37Table of Contents •Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience merchandise in retail markets in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. •Midstream – includes the operations of MPLX and certain other related operations. The Midstream segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs; and transports and stores crude oil and refined products, principally for the Refining & Marketing segment. Strategic Actions to Enhance Shareholder ValueOn January 3, 2017, we announced plans to significantly accelerate the dropdown of assets with an estimated $1.4 billion of MLP-eligible annual EBITDA to MPLX, subject to requisite approvals and regulatory clearances, including tax clearance, and market and other conditions. We expect these dropdowns to be valued consistent with recent industry precedent valuation multiples ranging between 7.0x and 9.0x EBITDA, subject to the MPLX conflicts committee review process and receipt of customary fairness opinions. We also expect MPLX to finance the dropdown transactions in the aggregate with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions. The equity financing is expected to be funded through MPLX common units issued to us. In conjunction with the closing of the dropdowns, we also expect to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of MPLX, including IDRs, for newly issued MPLX common units. These actions are designed to unlock the value inherent in our midstream platform and to provide an ongoing return of capital to shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. See “MPLX LP - Dropdowns to MPLX” for information on the first two of these dropdowns, which were completed on March 1, 2017 and September 1, 2017, and the remaining identified dropdown assets, with projected annual EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, which have been offered to MPLX.Our January 3, 2017 announcement included conducting a full and thorough review of Speedway to ensure optimum value is being delivered to shareholders over the long term. On September 5, 2017, we announced that our board of directors, based on a recommendation from its independent special committee, determined that maintaining Speedway as a fully integrated business with MPC provides the best opportunity for enhancing long-term shareholder value. Key factors in the board of directors’ decision to maintain Speedway as an integrated business within MPC included substantial integration synergies, support of MPC’s investment grade credit profile and ability to return capital to shareholders and the strong value of cash flow diversification. Executive SummaryResultsSelect results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions, except per share data) 2017 2016 2017 2016Refining & Marketing$1,097 $252 $1,589 $1,191Speedway209 209 583 569Midstream355 310 996 752Items not allocated to segments(85) (336) $(318) $(687)Income from operations$1,576 $435 $2,850 $1,825Net income attributable to MPC$903 $145 $1,416 $947Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$1.77 $0.27 $2.73 $1.78Net income attributable to MPC was $903 million, or $1.77 per diluted share, in the third quarter and $1.42 billion, or $2.73 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2017 compared to $145 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, and $947 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, for the same periods of 2016. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $845 million in the third quarter and $398 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The increase in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily a result of a $3.47 per barrel increase in gross margin. This favorable effect was due to significantly higher blended LLS-based crack spreads, partially offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared to spot market reference prices. The USGC and Chicago LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread increased to $12.69 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017 from $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to an increase in the USGC crack spread. Refinery throughputs exceeded 2 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2017 and crude oil capacity utilization was 102 percent for the third quarter of 2017 as compared to 100 percent for the third quarter of 2016. Segment results for the first nine months of 2016 included a non-cash benefit of $345 million related to the reversal of the Company’s LCM inventory valuation reserve. In the first nine months of 2017 as compared to 2016, excluding the LCM benefit, the favorable effect of higher blended LLS-based 38Table of Contents crack spreads was partially offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared to spot market reference prices. The USGC and Chicago LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread increased to $9.87 per barrel in the first nine months of 2017 from $6.82 per barrel in the first nine months of 2016. Speedway segment income from operations was comparable in the third quarter and increased $14 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The third quarter of 2017 results reflect the benefits of Speedway’s new joint venture with Pilot Flying J and reduced operating expenses, offset by lower light product gross margin, primarily driven by lower sales volumes, and lower merchandise gross margin. Speedway’s light product margin was 17.72 cents per gallon in the third quarter of 2017 compared with 17.73 cents per gallon in the third quarter of 2016. Segment results for the first nine months of 2016 included a non-cash benefit of $25 million related to the reversal of the Company’s LCM inventory valuation reserve. In the first nine months of 2017 as compared to 2016, excluding the LCM benefit, the increase in segment income was primarily due to contributions from Speedway’s new joint venture with Pilot Flying J and reduced operating expenses, partially offset by the absence of a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location in 2016 and lower light product gross margin, driven by lower volumes, and lower merchandise gross margin. Midstream segment income from operations increased $45 million in the third quarter and $244 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The increases were primarily due to higher natural gas gathering, processing and fractionation throughput volumes. The increase for the first nine months 2017 was also impacted by higher natural gas and NGL prices. Comparability of the Midstream segment's results to the first nine months of 2016 was also affected by the drop of certain terminal assets to MPLX during the first quarter of 2017. These assets were considered a business effective April 1, 2016 and the results of the light product terminals business are reflected in the Midstream segment from that date with an offsetting income from operations impact to the Refining & Marketing segment.Items not allocated to segments includes an $86 million charge in the first nine months of 2017 to reflect binding settlement agreements with the plaintiffs and co-defendants to settle four lawsuits brought forth by the plaintiffs alleging personal injuries from a fire that occurred at our Galveston Bay refinery on January 11, 2016. The other co-defendants in this litigation were contractors that were engaged by us to provide services at our Galveston Bay refinery. We are vigorously pursuing recovery of such losses, as well as defense costs, through indemnification from a significant contractor who is not party to the settlement agreements. Items not allocated to segments in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 also include a benefit of $2 million and $21 million, respectively, related to MPC’s share of gains from the sale of assets remaining from the canceled Sandpiper pipeline project. In the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016, unallocated items include impairment charges of $267 million and $356 million, respectively, related to equity method investments. The non-cash impairment charge in the third quarter of 2016 related to our equity investment in the Sandpiper pipeline project resulted from the indefinite deferral of this project. Impairment charges in the first nine months of 2016 also include $89 million related to an equity method investment held by MPLX and $130 million recorded by MPLX to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. MPLX LPAs of September 30, 2017, we owned a 30.4 percent interest in MPLX, including a two percent general partner interest. On December 4, 2015, MPLX completed the MarkWest Merger. The total value of consideration transferred was $8.61 billion, consisting of $7.33 billion in equity and $1.28 billion in cash. At closing, we made a payment of $1.23 billion to MarkWest common unitholders and the remaining $50 million was paid in equal amounts, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which was paid in July 2017, in connection with the conversion of the MPLX Class B Units to MPLX common units. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the MarkWest Merger.Reorganization TransactionsOn September 1, 2016, MPC, MPLX and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify MPLX’s ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting. In connection with these transactions, MPC contributed $225 million to MPLX and all of the issued and outstanding MPLX Class A Units, all of which were held by MarkWest Hydrocarbon, a subsidiary of MPLX, were exchanged for newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in MPLX. The simple average of the NYSE closing price of MPLX common units for the last 10 trading days preceding September 1, 2016 was used for purposes of these transactions. As a result of these transactions, MPC increased its ownership interest in MPLX by 7 million MPLX common units, or approximately 1 percent. Private Placement of Preferred UnitsOn May 13, 2016, MPLX completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the “MPLX Preferred Units”) for a cash price of $32.50 per unit. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the MPLX Preferred Units were used by MPLX for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes. 39Table of Contents The MPLX Preferred Units rank senior to all MPLX common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. The holders of the MPLX Preferred Units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to $0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of issuance. Following the second anniversary of the issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units, the holders of the MPLX Preferred Units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to the holders of common units. The MPLX Preferred Units are convertible into MPLX common units on a one for one basis after three years, at the purchasers’ option, and after four years at MPLX’s option, subject to certain conditions. The MPLX Preferred Units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside our control. Therefore, they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets. We have recorded the MPLX Preferred Units at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs. Since the MPLX Preferred Units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future, adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable that the security would become redeemable.Dropdowns to MPLXOn September 27, 2017, our board of directors authorized us to offer MPLX Fuels Distribution LLC and MPLX Refining Logistics LLC to MPLX in exchange for cash and MPLX limited and general partnership units. MPLX Fuels Distribution LLC is structured to provide a broad range of scheduling and marketing services as MPC’s sole and exclusive agent. MPLX Refining Logistics LLC contains the integrated tank farm assets that support MPC’s refining operations. These essential logistics assets include: approximately 56 million barrels of storage (crude, finished products and intermediates), 619 tanks, 32 rail and truck racks, 18 docks and gasoline blenders. This offer, which represents the remaining identified dropdown assets under our strategic actions with projected annual EBITDA of $1 billion, is currently under review by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of the general partner of MPLX. Further return of capital to shareholders is planned with the after-tax cash proceeds from these remaining dropdowns, consistent with maintaining an investment grade credit profile. Once the terms of the dropdown are finalized, MPC will immediately initiate the offer of its general partner economic interests in MPLX, including IDRs, to MPLX in exchange for newly issued MPLX common units in conjunction with the closing of the dropdown. This exchange will provide a clear valuation of MPC’s general partner interest and is expected to reduce MPLX’s cost of capital for the long term. The transactions are expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to requisite approvals and market conditions. On September 1, 2017, we contributed our joint-interest ownership in certain pipelines and storage facilities to MPLX in exchange for total consideration of $1.05 billion. This consideration consisted of MPLX equity and $420 million in cash. We received approximately 19 million MPLX common units and 378 thousand general partner units from MPLX, which was determined by dividing $630 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for the 10 trading days preceding the closing date, pursuant to a Membership Interests Contributions Agreement. We also agreed to waive two-thirds of the third quarter 2017 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions with respect to the common units issued in this transaction. The contributions of these assets were accounted for as transactions between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss. On March 1, 2017, we contributed certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX in exchange for total consideration of $2.0 billion. This consideration consisted of MPLX equity and $1.5 billion in cash. We received approximately 13 million common units and 264 thousand general partner units from MPLX, which was determined by dividing $504 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for the 10 trading days preceding the closing date, pursuant to the Membership Interests Contributions Agreement. We also agreed to waive two-thirds of the first quarter 2017 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions with respect to the common units issued in the transactions. The contributions of these assets were accounted for as transactions between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss. On March 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to MPLX in exchange for 23 million MPLX common units and 460 thousand general partner units. The number of units we received from MPLX was determined by dividing $600 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for the 10 trading days preceding March 14, 2016, pursuant to the Membership Interests Contribution Agreement. We also agreed to waive first-quarter 2016 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions, with respect to the common units issued in this transaction. The contribution of our inland marine business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss. 40Table of Contents Public OfferingsOn February 10, 2017, MPLX completed a public offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% unsecured senior notes due March 2027 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.200% unsecured senior notes due March 2047. The net proceeds were used to fund the $1.5 billion cash portion of the consideration MPLX paid MPC for the dropdown of assets on March 1, 2017, as well as for general partnership purposes. See Note 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information.ATM ProgramOn August 4, 2016, MPLX entered into a Second Amended and Restated Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) providing for the continuous issuance of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings under its ATM Program. MPLX expects to use the net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program for general partnership purposes including repayment of debt and funding for acquisitions, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, MPLX issued an aggregate of 14 million common units under the ATM Program, generating net proceeds of approximately $473 million. As of September 30, 2017, $1.74 billion of MPLX common units remains available for issuance through the ATM Program under the Distribution Agreement. Distributions from MPLXThe following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during the first nine months of 2017 and 2016.  Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions) 2017 2016Cash distributions received from MPLX:   General partner distributions, including IDRs$205 $134Limited partner distributions143 99Total$348 $233The market value of the 118.1 million MPLX common units we owned at September 30, 2017 was $4.13 billion based on the September 29, 2017 closing unit price of $35.01. We also believe there is substantial value attributable to our two percent general partner interest, including the IDRs.On October 25, 2017, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.5875 per common unit payable on November 14, 2017. As a result, MPLX will make distributions totaling $320 million to its limited and general partners. MPC’s portion of these distributions is approximately $150 million. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.Acquisitions and InvestmentsOn March 1, 2017, MPLX purchased the Ozark pipeline for approximately $219 million from Enbridge Pipelines (Ozark) LLC. The Ozark pipeline is a 433-mile, 22-inch crude oil pipeline originating in Cushing, Oklahoma, and terminating in Wood River, Illinois, capable of transporting approximately 230 mbpd. On February 15, 2017, MPLX acquired a partial, indirect equity interest in the Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company Pipeline (“ETCOP”) projects, collectively referred to as the Bakken Pipeline system, through a joint venture with Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. (“Enbridge Energy Partners”). The Bakken Pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470 mbpd of crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to the Midwest through Patoka, Illinois and ultimately to the Gulf Coast. MPLX contributed $500 million of the $2 billion purchase price paid by the joint venture to acquire a 36.75 percent indirect equity interest in the Bakken Pipeline system from Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”) and Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. (“SXL”). MPLX holds, through a subsidiary, a 25 percent interest in the joint venture, which equates to an approximate 9.2 percent indirect equity interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. In connection with closing the transaction with ETP and SXL and the previous decision to indefinitely suspend the Sandpiper pipeline project, Enbridge Energy Partners canceled MPC’s transportation services agreement with respect to the Sandpiper pipeline and released MPC from paying any termination fee per that agreement.41Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2017, MarkWest, and Antero Midstream formed a joint venture, Sherwood Midstream, to support the development of Antero Resources Corporation’s Marcellus Shale acreage in West Virginia. MarkWest has a 50 percent ownership interest in Sherwood Midstream. In connection with this transaction, MarkWest contributed certain gas processing plants currently under construction at the Sherwood Complex with a fair value of approximately $134 million and cash of approximately $20 million. Antero Midstream made an initial capital contribution of approximately $154 million. Also effective January 1, 2017, MarkWest converted all of its ownership interests in Ohio Fractionation, a previously wholly-owned subsidiary, to Class A Interests and amended its LLC Agreement to create Class B-3 Interests, which were sold to Sherwood Midstream for $126 million in cash. The Class B-3 Interests provide Sherwood Midstream with the right to fractionation revenue and the obligation to pay expenses related to 20 mbpd of capacity in the Hopedale 3 fractionator.Effective January 1, 2017, MarkWest and Sherwood Midstream formed a joint venture, Sherwood Midstream Holdings, for the purpose of owning, operating and maintaining all of the shared assets for the benefit of and use in the operation of the gas plants and other assets owned by Sherwood Midstream and the gas plants and de-ethanization facilities owned by MarkWest. MarkWest contributed certain real property, equipment and facilities with a fair value of approximately $209 million to Sherwood Midstream Holdings in exchange for a 79 percent initial ownership interest. Sherwood Midstream contributed cash of approximately $44 million to Sherwood Midstream Holdings in exchange for a 21 percent ownership interest. MarkWest has a 10.5 percent indirect interest in Sherwood Midstream Holdings through its ownership in Sherwood Midstream. The net book value of the contributed assets was approximately $203 million. The contribution was determined to be an in-substance sale of real estate. As such, MarkWest only recognized a gain for the portion attributable to Antero Midstream’s indirect interest of approximately $2 million. We account for the investments in Sherwood Midstream and Sherwood Midstream Holdings as part of our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting and we continue to consolidate Ohio Fractionation.See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the investments in Sherwood Midstream, Ohio Fractionation and Sherwood Midstream Holdings. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Speedway and Pilot Flying J finalized the formation of a joint venture originally consisting of travel plazas, primarily in the Southeast region of the United States. The new entity, PFJ Southeast, originally consisted of 41 existing locations contributed by Speedway and 82 locations contributed by Pilot Flying J, all of which carry either the Pilot or Flying J brand and are operated by Pilot Flying J. Our non-cash contribution was $273 million based on the book value of the assets we contributed to the joint venture.We currently have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures with Crowley, which were established to own and operate Jones Act vessels in petroleum product service.In September 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture, Crowley Ocean Partners, with Crowley. The joint venture owns and operates four new Jones Act product tankers, three of which are leased to MPC. Two of the vessels were delivered in 2015 and the remaining two were delivered in 2016. We have contributed a total of $141 million for the four vessels.In May 2016, MPC and Crowley formed a new ocean vessel joint venture, Crowley Coastal Partners, in which MPC has a 50 percent ownership interest. MPC and Crowley each contributed their 50 percent ownership in Crowley Ocean Partners, discussed above, into Crowley Coastal Partners. In addition, we contributed $48 million in cash and Crowley contributed its 100 percent ownership interest in Crowley Blue Water Partners to Crowley Coastal Partners. Crowley Blue Water Partners is an entity that owns and operates three 750 Series ATB vessels that are leased to MPC. We account for our 50 percent interest in Crowley Coastal Partners as part of our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting.See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on Crowley Coastal Partners as a VIE and Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of Crowley Ocean Partners and Crowley Blue Water Partners.Share Repurchases On May 31, 2017, our board of directors approved an additional $3.0 billion share repurchase authorization. This authorization is in addition to its previous authorization, both of which have no expiration date.Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $13.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $9.06 billion of our common stock, leaving $3.94 billion available for repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we acquired 31 million common shares at an average cost per share of $52.16 under these authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.42Table of Contents We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.LiquidityAs of September 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.09 billion, excluding MPLX's cash and cash equivalents, $3.5 billion of unused bank revolving credit facilities and full availability under our $750 million trade receivables facility. As of September 30, 2017, we do not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2017, MPLX had cash and cash equivalents of $3 million and approximately $1.8 billion available through its bank revolving credit facility and $298 million available through its $500 million credit facility with MPC. On July 21, 2017, we entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of lenders to replace MPC’s previous $2.5 billion four-year bank revolving credit facility and $1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility. The new credit agreements provide for a $2.5 billion five-year bank revolving credit facility that expires in July 2022 and a $1 billion 364-day bank revolving credit facility that expires in July 2018. In addition, on July 21, 2017, MPLX entered into a credit agreement to replace its previous $2 billion five-year bank revolving credit facility with a $2.25 billion five-year bank revolving credit facility that expires in July 2022. The financial covenants and the interest rate terms contained in the new credit agreements are substantially the same as those contained in the previous bank revolving credit facilities.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the announced strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value, the ATM Program and our share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect our strategic initiatives include, but are not limited to, the time, costs and ability to obtain regulatory or other approvals and consents and otherwise consummate the strategic initiatives; the satisfaction or waiver of conditions in the agreements governing the strategic initiatives; our ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic initiatives; the impact of adverse market conditions affecting MPC’s and MPLX’s midstream businesses; adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters; inability to agree with the MPLX conflicts committee with respect to the timing of and value attributed to assets identified for dropdown and/or the general partner economic interests. Factors that could affect the ATM program and the timing of any issuances under the ATM Program include, but are not limited to, market conditions, availability of liquidity and the market prices of MPLX common units. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, our ability to generate sufficient income and cash flow to effect the intended share repurchases, including within the expected timeframe, our ability to manage disruption in credit markets or changes to our credit rating, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ULSD and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.43Table of Contents The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.

Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Costs for planned turnaround, major maintenance and engineering projects are expensed in the period incurred. SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, transportation fuel prices, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway’s gross margin. Speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.MidstreamNGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.44Table of Contents The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. The profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions) 2017 2016 Variance 2017 2016 VarianceRevenues and other income:           Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$19,053 $16,616 $2,437 $53,220 $46,179 $7,041Sales to related parties157 2 $155 458 5 $453Income (loss) from equity method investments84 (208) 292 224 (236) 460Net gain on disposal of assets— 1 (1) 12 26 (14)Other income92 49 43 219 106 113Total revenues and other income19,386 16,460 2,926 54,133 46,080 8,053Costs and expenses:           Cost of revenues (excludes items below)14,605 12,944 1,661 41,913 35,475 6,438Purchases from related parties148 128 20 420 359 61Inventory market valuation adjustment— — — — (370) 370Consumer excise taxes2,012 1,914 98 5,751 5,633 118Impairment expense— — — — 130 (130)Depreciation and amortization517 507 10 1,574 1,497 77Selling, general and administrative expenses412 420 (8) 1,286 1,199 87Other taxes116 112 4 339 332 7Total costs and expenses17,810 16,025 1,785 51,283 44,255 7,028Income from operations1,576 435 1,141 2,850 1,825 1,025Net interest and other financial income (costs)(157) (141) (16) (465) (420) (45)Income before income taxes1,419 294 1,125 2,385 1,405 980Provision for income taxes415 75 340 706 481 225Net income1,004 219 785 1,679 924 755Less net income (loss) attributable to:           Redeemable noncontrolling interest16 16 — 49 25 24Noncontrolling interests85 58 27 214 (48) 262Net income attributable to MPC$903 $145 $758 $1,416 $947 $46945Table of Contents Net income attributable to MPC increased $758 million in the third quarter and $469 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016 primarily due to increases in income from operations for our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments. Income from operations for the first nine months of 2016 includes a non-cash benefit of $370 million related to the reversal of the Company’s LCM inventory valuation reserve. Items not allocated to segments includes impairment charges of $267 million in the third quarter and $356 million in the first nine months of 2016 related to equity method investments. Items not allocated to segments for the first nine months of 2016 also includes $130 million recorded by MPLX to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. See Segment Results for additional information.Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $2.44 billion in the third quarter and $7.04 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The increases were primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices, which increased $0.21 per gallon and $0.25 per gallon, respectively, and an increase in refined product sales volumes in the third quarter of 2017. Sales to related parties increased $155 million in the third quarter and $453 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016, mainly due to sales from our Refining & Marketing segment to PFJ Southeast, a joint venture with Pilot Flying J, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016. Income (loss) from equity method investments improved $292 million in the third quarter and $460 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The improvements in both periods are primarily due to the absence of impairment charges related to equity method investments of $267 million and $356 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. In addition, the improvement for the first nine months reflects increases in income from new and existing pipeline, retail and marine affiliates. The amounts in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 also include $2 million and $21 million, respectively, related to MPC’s share of gains from the sale of assets remaining from the canceled Sandpiper pipeline project, which was impaired in the third quarter of 2016.Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $14 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, mainly due to the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016. Other income increased $43 million in the third quarter and $113 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016, primarily due to increases in RIN sales.Cost of revenues increased $1.66 billion in the third quarter and $6.44 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The increases were primarily due to:•increases in refined product cost of sales of $1.77 billion and $6.36 billion, respectively, primarily due to increases in raw material costs; •an increase in refinery direct operating costs of $102 million in the first nine months primarily due to an increase in other manufacturing costs, including utilities; and•partially offset by a decrease in refinery direct operating costs of $67 million in the third quarter primarily due to a decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance activity. Purchases from related parties increased $20 million in the third quarter and $61 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016, largely due to:•increases in transportation services provided by our marine joint ventures with Crowley of $5 million and $49 million, respectively; and•increases in volumes of ethanol purchased from TAME, TACE and TAAE of $9 million and $10 million, respectively. Inventory market valuation adjustment decreased costs and expenses by $370 million in the first nine months of 2016 related to the reversal of the LCM inventory valuation reserve due to increased refined product prices during the second quarter of 2016.Consumer excise taxes increased $98 million in the third quarter and $118 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, mainly due to increases in tax rates in certain locations. In the first nine months, the increase was partially offset by a decrease in taxable refined product sales volumes.Impairment expense reflects goodwill impairment charges of $130 million recorded by MPLX in the first nine months of 2016. Depreciation and amortization increased $10 million in the third quarter and $77 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The increase in the first nine months is primarily the result of the decommissioning of an MPLX gas processing facility in conjunction with an expansion project at the Houston Complex.46Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $8 million in the third quarter and increased $87 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. In the first nine months of 2017, we recognized an $86 million charge to reflect settlement agreements related to certain litigation matters. Other taxes were consistent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016.Net interest and other financial costs increased $16 million in the third quarter and $45 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016, primarily due to the MPLX senior notes issued in February 2017, partially offset by decreased borrowings on the MPC term loan agreement. The increase in the first nine months was also partially offset by decreased borrowings on the MPLX bank revolving credit facility.Provision for income taxes increased $340 million in the third quarter and $225 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016, primarily due to increases in income before income taxes of $1.13 billion in the third quarter and $980 million in the first nine months of 2017 as well as lower effective tax rates. The combined federal, state and foreign income tax rate was 29 percent and 26 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 30 percent and 34 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the domestic manufacturing deduction and equity compensation offset by state and local tax expense. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 varies from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to the effects of a lower forecasted annual effective tax rate as compared to the forecasted rate used for the first six months of 2016. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent tax differences related to the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (including their proportional share of the goodwill impairment charge recorded by MPLX), the domestic manufacturing deduction and state and local tax expense.Segment ResultsRevenuesRevenues, including intersegment sales, are summarized by segment in the following table.

The increases were primarily due to higher refined product sales prices partially offset by lower volumes. The lower sales volumes to Speedway in both periods were mainly due to Speedway’s contribution of 41 travel centers to a new joint venture, PFJ Southeast, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The refined product sales to PFJ Southeast continue to be reported in the Refining & Marketing segment totals above, but are no longer considered sales to the Speedway segment. The table below shows our Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment.

The increase in revenues in the third quarter was primarily due to an increase in gasoline and distillate sales of $96 million, partially offset by a decrease in merchandise sales of $43 million. Average gasoline and distillate selling prices increased $0.22 per gallon which was partially offset by decreased gasoline and distillate sales volumes of 111 million gallons in the third quarter. The increase in revenues in the first nine months was primarily due to an increase in gasoline and distillate sales of $502 million, partially offset by a decrease in merchandise sales of $84 million. Average gasoline and distillate selling prices during the first nine months increased $0.24 per gallon which was partially offset by a decrease in sales volumes of 273 million gallons. The decreases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and merchandise sales in both periods are primarily attributable to the contribution of 41 travel centers to PFJ Southeast in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway’s share of the results from PFJ Southeast are reported as income from equity method investments.The following table includes certain revenue statistics for the Speedway segment.

The increases were primarily due to increased revenue from higher natural gas and NGL processing and fractionation volumes and prices and the recently acquired Ozark pipeline. The comparison for the first nine months also reflects the absence of any revenues for the terminal services provided to the Refining & Marketing segment in the first quarter of 2016 versus the inclusion of revenues for these services in the first quarter of 2017. These assets were not considered a business prior to April 1, 2016, and therefore, no financial results for these assets were available from which to recast first quarter 2016 Midstream segment results.

The increase in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily a result of a $3.47 per barrel increase in gross margin. This favorable effect was due to significantly higher blended LLS-based crack spreads, partially offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared to spot market reference prices. The USGC and Chicago LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread increased to $12.69 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017 from $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to an increase in USGC crack spread. Refinery throughputs exceeded 2 million barrels per day in the third quarter of 2017 and crude oil capacity utilization was 102 percent for the third quarter of 2017 as compared to 100 percent for the third quarter of 2016. Segment results for the first nine months of 2016 included a non-cash benefit of $345 million related to the reversal of the Company’s LCM inventory valuation reserve. In the first nine months of 2017 as compared to 2016, excluding the LCM benefit, the favorable effect of higher blended LLS-based crack spreads was partially offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared to spot market reference prices. The USGC and Chicago LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread increased to $9.87 per barrel in the first nine months of 2017 from $6.82 per barrel in the first nine months of 2016.The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment’s business.

The above market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including the effects of product price realizations, the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, as well as the effects of inventory valuation adjustments, market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had an estimated negative impact on Refining & Marketing segment income of $234 million for the third quarter and $1.17 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. 50Table of Contents The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

The increase in the third quarter of 2017 is primarily due to decreased turnaround activity at our Galveston Bay refinery in the third quarter of 2017 in addition to operational efficiencies resulting from turnaround activity performed subsequent to the third quarter of 2016 at our Robinson refinery. The increase in the first nine months is primarily due to operational efficiencies resulting from turnaround activity performed during and subsequent to the third quarter of 2016 at our Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries, respectively.The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment. Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel)(a)(b)$14.14 $10.67 $12.42 $11.11Refinery direct operating costs (dollars per barrel):(c)       Planned turnaround and major maintenance$1.20 $1.62 $1.69 $1.72Depreciation and amortization1.34 1.42 1.44 1.46Other manufacturing(d)3.83 4.01 4.10 4.03Total$6.37 $7.05 $7.23 $7.21(a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by total refinery throughputs.(b) Excludes LCM inventory valuation adjustments. Comparable prior period information for gross margin has been recast in connection with the contribution of certain pipeline assets to MPLX on March 1, 2017.(c) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs.(d) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs.Refinery direct operating costs decreased $0.68 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 primarily due to decreases in planned turnaround and major maintenance and other manufacturing costs of $0.42 per barrel and $0.18 per barrel, respectively. The decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs for the third quarter of 2017 was largely attributable to lower turnaround costs incurred by the Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries, partially offset by an increase in turnaround costs incurred by the Catlettsburg refinery. Other manufacturing costs per barrel decreased in the third quarter as increased refinery throughputs offset increases in utilities and operating costs. Refinery direct operating costs increased $0.02 in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, mainly due to an increase in other manufacturing costs of $0.07 per barrel, partially offset by a decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance of $0.03 per barrel. Other manufacturing costs increased in the first nine months primarily due to increased utilities and catalyst costs. The decrease in planned turnaround and major maintenance for the first nine months of 2017 reflects lower turnaround costs incurred by the Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries, partially offset by higher turnaround costs incurred by the Texas City and Catlettsburg refineries. We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with RINs increased to $127 million in the third quarter and $328 million in the first nine months of 2017 from $80 million in the third quarter and $221 million in the first nine months of 2016. The increases for both periods of 2017 were primarily due to higher weighted average RIN costs driven by higher market prices for purchased RINs and increases in the number of RINs purchased. Speedway segment income from operations was comparable in the third quarter and increased $14 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The third quarter results reflect the benefits of Speedway’s new joint venture with Pilot Flying J and reduced operating expenses, offset by lower light product gross margin, primarily driven by 51Table of Contents lower sales volumes, and lower merchandise gross margins. Speedway’s light product margin was 17.72 cents per gallon in the third quarter of 2017 compared with 17.73 cents per gallon in the third quarter of 2016. Segment results for the first nine months of 2016 included a $25 million non-cash benefit related to the reversal of the Company’s LCM charge. In the first nine months of 2017 as compared to 2016, excluding the LCM benefit, the increase in segment income was primarily due to contributions from Speedway’s new joint venture with Pilot Flying J and reduced operating expenses partially offset by the absence of a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location in 2016 and lower light product gross margin, driven by lower volumes, and lower merchandise gross margin. The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment. Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016Gasoline and distillate sales (millions of gallons)(a)1,464 1,575 4,332 4,605Gasoline & distillate gross margin (dollars per gallon)(a)(b)(c)$0.1772 $0.1773 $0.1727 $0.1668Merchandise gross margin (in millions)(a)$374 $386 $1,065 $1,085Merchandise gross margin percent(a)28.9% 28.9% 28.8% 28.7%(a) Third quarter and first nine months of 2017 statistics do not reflect any information for the 41 travel centers Speedway contributed to PFJ Southeast, whereas they are reflected in the same periods of 2016 statistics.(b) The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, divided by gasoline and distillate sales volume. (c) Excludes LCM inventory valuation adjustments.Midstream segment income from operations increased $45 million in the third quarter and $244 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the same periods of 2016. The increases were primarily due to higher natural gas gathering, processing and fractionation throughput volumes. The increase for the first nine months 2017 was also impacted by higher natural gas and NGL prices. Comparability of the Midstream segment's results to the first nine months of 2016 was also affected by the drop of certain terminal assets to MPLX during the first quarter of 2017. These assets were considered a business effective April 1, 2016 and the results of the light product terminals business are reflected in the Midstream segment from that date with an offsetting income from operations impact to the Refining & Marketing segment. Corporate and other unallocated items increased $21 million in the third quarter and $57 million in the first nine months of 2017, largely due to higher corporate expenses and increases in employee benefit expenses in both periods, in addition to lower allocation of corporate costs to the segments in the first nine months of 2017.Items not allocated to segments includes an $86 million charge in the first nine months of 2017 to reflect binding settlement agreements related to certain litigation matters. Items not allocated to segments also include benefits of $2 million and $21 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, related to MPC’s share of gains from the sale of assets remaining from the canceled Sandpiper pipeline project. In the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016, unallocated items include impairment charges of $267 million and $356 million, respectively, related to equity method investments. The non-cash impairment charge in the third quarter related to MPC’s equity investment in the Sandpiper pipeline project resulted from the indefinite deferral of this project. Impairment charges in the first nine months of 2016 also include $89 million related to an equity method investment held by MPLX and $130 million recorded by MPLX to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. 52Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $2.09 billion at September 30, 2017 compared to $887 million at December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first nine months of 2017 and 2016 are presented in the following table.  Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions) 2017 2016Net cash provided by (used in):   Operating activities$3,863 $3,002Investing activities(2,615) (2,217)Financing activities(47) (1,203)Total$1,201 $(418)Net cash provided by operating activities increased $861 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to a favorable change in working capital of $517 million and an increase in operating results. Changes in working capital, excluding changes in short-term debt, were a net $622 million source of cash in the first nine months of 2017 compared to a net $105 million source of cash in the first nine months of 2016. The changes in working capital for the first nine months of 2017 were primarily due to an increase in accounts payables and accrued liabilities and a decrease in inventories partially offset by an increase in current receivables. Changes from December 31, 2016 to September 30, 2017 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable increased $566 million from year-end 2016, primarily due higher crude oil prices and volumes purchased.•Current receivables increased $283 million from year-end 2016, primarily due to higher refined product prices slightly offset by lower volumes.•Inventories decreased $163 million from year-end 2016, primarily due to decreases in refined product and crude inventories. The changes in working capital for the first nine months of 2016 were primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in inventories, excluding the Company’s non-cash reversal of the LCM inventory valuation reserve, partially offset by an increase in current receivables. Changes from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable increased $312 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil prices and higher volumes.•Current receivables increased $209 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil prices.•Excluding the change in the Company’s LCM inventory valuation reserve of $370 million, inventories decreased $71 million primarily due to a decrease in refined product inventory volumes. Net cash used in investing activities was $398 million higher in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016 primarily due to investments and acquisitions made by MPLX during the first nine months, which are described further below. 53Table of Contents The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows.

(b) Includes capitalized interest of $39 million and $47 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Net cash contributed to equity method investments increased $446 million for the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to MPLX’s investment of $500 million for a partial interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. Net cash used for acquisitions increased primarily due to MPLX’s acquisition of the Ozark pipeline for $219 million. Net cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment decreased $219 million mainly due to decreased capital expenditures in Refining & Marketing and Corporate and Other. Cash from disposal of assets decreased $24 million largely due to the absence of a sale of a Speedway retail location in the first nine months 2016. The net cash from all other investing activities increased $102 million primarily due to increased RIN sales. Financing activities were a net $47 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2017 compared to a net $1.20 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2016. In the first nine months of 2017, sources of cash from financing activities included long-term debt borrowings, proceeds from issuances of MPLX common units and contributions from noncontrolling interests which were more than offset by uses of cash in financing activities including common stock repurchases, dividend payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests, long-term debt repayments and a portion of the contingent consideration payment to the seller of the Galveston Bay refinery. Long-term debt borrowings and repayments, including debt issuance costs, were a net $2.16 billion source of cash in the first nine months of 2017 compared to a net $1.41 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2016. During the first nine months of 2017, MPLX issued $2.25 billion of senior notes, borrowed $420 million under the MPLX bank revolving credit agreement, repaid the remaining $250 million under the MPLX term loan agreement and we repaid the remaining $200 million balance under the MPC term loan agreement. During the first nine months of 2016, MPLX repaid amounts outstanding under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility.54Table of Contents Cash used in common stock repurchases increased $1.45 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016 as cash proceeds from the dropdowns of certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX on March 1, 2017 and joint-interest ownership in certain pipelines and storage facilities on September 1, 2017 supported share repurchases of $1.62 billion in the first nine months of 2017. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases for these periods. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase authorizations.  Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions, except per share data) 2017 2016Number of shares repurchased31 4Cash paid for shares repurchased$1,622 $177Effective average cost per delivered share$52.16 $41.14Cash used in dividend payments increased $49 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to a $0.12 per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our dividend payments were $1.12 per common share in the first nine months of 2017 compared to $1.00 per common share in the first nine months of 2016.Cash used in distributions to noncontrolling interests increased $116 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016. The distributions increased primarily due to an increase in total MPLX common units outstanding and distributions paid on the MPLX Preferred Units. Cash provided by contributions from noncontrolling interests increased $124 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to MarkWest’s sale of a noncontrolling interest in Ohio Fractionation to Sherwood Midstream. Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.Capital ResourcesOur liquidity totaled $6.34 billion at September 30, 2017 consisting of:  September 30, 2017(In millions) Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings AvailableCapacityBank revolving credit facility(a)$2,500 $— $2,500364 day bank revolving credit facility1,000 — $1,000Trade receivables facility750 — 750Total$4,250 $— $4,250Cash and cash equivalents(b)    $2,085Total liquidity    $6,335(a) Excludes MPLX’s $2.25 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had approximately $1.8 billion available as of September 30, 2017.(b) Excludes $3 million of MPLX cash and cash equivalents.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets and a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. On July 21, 2017, we entered into credit agreements with a syndicate of lenders to replace MPC’s previous $2.5 billion four-year bank revolving credit facility and $1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility. The new credit agreements provide for a $2.5 billion five-year bank revolving credit facility that expires in July 2022 and a $1 billion 364-day bank revolving credit facility that expires in July 2018. In addition, on July 21, 2017, MPLX entered into a credit agreement to replace its previous $2 billion five-year bank revolving credit facility with a $2.25 billion five-year bank revolving credit facility that expires in July 2022. The financial covenants and the interest rate terms contained in the new credit agreements are substantially the same as those contained in the previous bank revolving credit facilities.55Table of Contents As discussed in the “Strategic Actions to Enhance Shareholder Value” section in the Corporate Overview, we expect MPLX to finance the planned dropdown transactions in the aggregate with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions. The equity financing will be funded through MPLX common units issued to us. After-tax cash proceeds from the dropdowns are expected to fund the return of capital to MPC shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.On February 10, 2017, MPLX completed a public offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% unsecured senior notes due March 2027 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.200% unsecured senior notes due March 2047. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1st and September 1st of each year, commencing on September 1, 2017.We established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2017, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. The MPC bank revolving credit facility and MPLX credit agreement, which provides for the MPLX bank revolving credit facility (“MPLX Credit Agreement”), contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC bank revolving credit facility) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with this financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.25 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPC bank revolving credit facility.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. As of September 30, 2017, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.4 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.As disclosed in Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, we expect the adoption of the lease accounting standard update to result in the recognition of a significant lease obligation. The MPC bank revolving credit facility and the MPLX Credit Agreement both contain provisions under which the effects of the new accounting standard are not recognized for purposes of financial covenant calculations.Our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. As of September 30, 2017, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. CompanyRating AgencyRatingMPCMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook) FitchBBB (stable outlook)MPLXMoody’sBaa3 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB- (stable outlook) FitchBBB- (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Neither the MPC bank revolving credit facility, MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the MPC bank revolving credit facility, MPLX Credit Agreement, our trade receivables facility and debt held by our ocean vessel joint venture with Crowley. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis or result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.56Table of Contents Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 38 percent at September 30, 2017 and 33 percent at December 31, 2016.(In millions)September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Debt due within one year$29 $28Long-term debt12,753 10,544Total debt$12,782 $10,572Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$12,782 $10,572Redeemable noncontrolling interest1,000 1,000Total equity19,802 20,203Total capital$33,584 $31,775Debt-to-total-capital ratio38% 33% Capital RequirementsOur board originally approved a 2017 capital spending and investment plan of $1.7 billion for MPC, excluding MPLX. This budget includes spending on refining and marketing, retail and non-MPLX midstream projects as well as amounts designated for corporate projects. The remaining midstream projects are included in the MPLX budget. During the first quarter of 2017, MPLX updated its plan for organic growth capital to a range of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion, up from $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. The increase includes capital to support the development of additional natural gas processing facilities, including the Argo I plant in the Delaware Basin and the Sherwood Complex in the Northeast, and an expansion of the Ozark pipeline. MPLX anticipates its organic growth capital spending for the year to be below the forecasted range. MPLX maintenance capital is forecast to be approximately $150 million, an increase of $50 million versus previous guidance, primarily due to expenditures related to assets MPLX acquired during the quarter. Approximately $100 million of these increases will result in a corresponding reduction to MPC’s capital spending plan as the spending relates to the assets that were contributed to MPLX on March 1, 2017. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our capital expenditures and investments totaled $2.14 billion, excluding MPLX’s acquisitions of a partial interest in the Bakken Pipeline system for $500 million and the Ozark pipeline for approximately $220 million and capitalized interest. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.During the second quarter of 2017, we paid BP $131 million for the fourth year’s contingent earnout related to our 2013 acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery. This second quarter payment represents the final payment under the agreement. See Note 14 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the third quarter of 2017. At September 30, 2017, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If market conditions were to change and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of September 30, 2017, our equity investment in Centennial was $36 million and we had a $22 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial’s outstanding debt. See Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we chose to make a $120 million voluntary contribution to our funded pension plans. We may choose to make voluntary contributions for future years at our discretion. On October 25, 2017, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.40 per share on common stock. The dividend is payable December 11, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 16, 2017. During the first nine months of 2017, we paid $1.62 billion to acquire 31 million common shares through open market share repurchases at an effective average cost of $52.16 per delivered share. These share repurchases were supported by cash proceeds from the dropdowns of certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX on March 1, 2017 and joint-interest ownership in certain pipelines and storage facilities on September 1, 2017. Additionally, we plan to repurchase approximately $550 million of common shares in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to maintaining our investment grade profile. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.57Table of Contents We may utilize various methods to effect additional share repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future share repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.We may, from time to time, repurchase our senior notes in the open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.Contractual Cash Obligations As of September 30, 2017, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first nine months of 2017, our long-term debt commitments increased $3.87 billion due to the public offering of MPLX senior notes in February 2017 and borrowings of $420 million under the MPLX bank revolving credit agreement, partially offset by repayment of outstanding borrowings of $250 million and $200 million under the MPLX term loan agreement and MPC term loan agreement, respectively. In the first nine months of 2017, our transportation services agreement for the Sandpiper pipeline was terminated and we entered into two new transportation services agreements. As a result, we had a net decrease in our long-term transportation commitments of $1.67 billion which affected the years 2018 to 2021 and beyond. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under U.S. GAAP. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital requirements, including our capital budget and investment spending, costs for projects under construction, project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth, upgrades and expansion, the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment, future contributions to our funded pension plans and share repurchases. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking statements regarding capital requirements include: the availability of liquidity; business conditions; a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets; our ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic initiatives discussed herein; adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters; inability to agree with the MPLX conflicts committee with respect to the timing of and value attributed to assets identified for dropdown and/or the general partner economic interests; our ability to generate sufficient income and cash flow to effect the intended share repurchases, including within the expected timeframe; our ability to manage disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit rating; the potential impact on our share price if we are unable to effect the intended share repurchases; changes to the expected construction costs and timing of projects; delays in obtaining third-party approvals; changes in labor, materials and equipment costs and availability; planned and unplanned outages; the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects; project cost overruns; disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor or unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response; civil protests and resulting legal/regulatory uncertainty regarding environmental and social issues, including pipeline infrastructure, may prevent or delay the construction and operation of such infrastructure and realization of associated revenues; continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions; the availability and pricing of crude oil and other feedstocks; slower growth in domestic and Canadian crude supply; completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the U.S. Midwest; consumer demand for refined products; transportation logistics; the 58Table of Contents reliability of processing units and other equipment; MPC's ability to successfully implement growth opportunities; modifications to MPLX earnings and distribution growth objectives; compliance with federal and state environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations, including the cost of compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard, and/or enforcement actions initiated thereunder; adverse results in litigation; changes to MPC's capital budget; other risk factors inherent to MPC's industry. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will have estimated capital expenditures of $650 million between 2014 and 2020 to comply with these standards, which includes approximately $210 million in 2017.There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2017.Critical Accounting EstimatesThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2017. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted As discussed in Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future.59Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.See Notes 14 and 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of September 30, 2017 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after September 30, 2017 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt, including the portion classified as current and excluding capital leases, as of September 30, 2017 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(In millions) Fair Value as of September 30, 2017(a) Change inFair Value(b) Change in Net Income for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017(c)Long-term debt     Fixed-rate$13,270  $1,148 n/aVariable-rate420 n/a 2(a) Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(b) Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at September 30, 2017.(c) Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the MPLX term loan facility, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.60Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2017, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.61Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions)2017 2016 2017 2016Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing(a)(b)$1,097 $252 $1,589 $1,191Speedway(b)209 209 583 569Midstream(a)(c)355 310 996 752Items not allocated to segments:        Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(c)(86) (65) (251) (194) Pension settlement expenses(1) (4) (2) (7) Litigation— — (86) — Impairments(d)2 (267) 21 (486)Income from operations$1,576 $435 $2,850 $1,825Capital Expenditures and Investments(e)       Refining & Marketing$198 $251 $570 $756Speedway108 71 221 191Midstream(f)453 410 2,017 1,179Corporate and Other(g)32 29 92 106Total$791 $761 $2,900 $2,232(a) We revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the contribution of certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX. The operating results for these assets, which were previously included in the Refining & Marketing segment, are now included in the Midstream segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised presentation. The results for the pipeline and storage assets were recast effective January 1, 2015, and the results for the terminal assets were recast effective April 1, 2016. Prior to these dates, these assets were not considered businesses and, therefore, there are no financial results from which to recast segment results.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings, other than items arising in the ordinary course of business, previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Environmental ProceedingsAs previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, in July 2015, representatives from the EPA and the United States Department of Justice conducted a raid on a MarkWest Liberty Midstream pipeline launcher/receiver site utilized for pipeline maintenance operations in Washington County, Pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant issued by a magistrate of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. As part of this initiative, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, proceeded with an investigation of MarkWest Liberty Midstream’s launcher/receiver, pipeline and compressor station operations. In response to the investigation, MarkWest initiated independent studies which demonstrated that there was no risk to worker safety and no threat of public harm associated with MarkWest Liberty Midstream’s launcher/receiver operations. These findings were supported by a subsequent inspection and review by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. After providing these studies, and other substantial documentation related to MarkWest Liberty Midstream's pipeline and compressor stations, and arranging site visits and conducting several meetings with the government’s representatives, on September 13, 2016, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania rendered a declination decision, dropping its criminal investigation and declining to pursue charges in this matter.MarkWest Liberty Midstream continues to discuss with the EPA and the State of Pennsylvania civil enforcement allegations associated with permitting or other related regulatory obligations for its launcher/receiver and compressor station facilities in the region. In connection with these discussions, MarkWest Liberty Midstream received an initial proposal from the EPA to settle all civil claims associated with this matter for the combination of a proposed cash penalty of approximately $2.4 million and proposed supplemental environmental projects with an estimated cost of approximately $3.6 million. MarkWest Liberty Midstream has submitted a response asserting that this action involves novel issues surrounding primarily minor source emissions from facilities that the agencies themselves considered de minimis and were not the subject of regulation and consequently that the settlement proposal is excessive. In connection with these negotiations, MarkWest Liberty Midstream has received a revised settlement proposal from the EPA which proposes to lower the proposed cash penalty to approximately $1.2 million and the estimated cost of proposed supplemental environmental projects to an estimated cost of approximately $1.6 million. MarkWest Liberty Midstream will continue to negotiate with EPA regarding the amount and scope of the proposed settlement.65Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A.
