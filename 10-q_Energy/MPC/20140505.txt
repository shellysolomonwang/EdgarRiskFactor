Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered.Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets;•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway® convenience stores; and•Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX and MPC’s retained pipeline assets and investments.Executive SummaryNet income attributable to MPC was $199 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2014 compared to $725 million, or $2.17 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2013. The decrease was primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment, which generated income from operations of $362 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $1.11 billion in the first quarter of 2013. The decrease in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround costs, partially offset by higher crack spreads and more favorable net product price realizations.Speedway segment income from operations decreased $9 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to a lower gasoline and distillate gross margin and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a higher merchandise gross margin.Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $21 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013. The increase primarily reflects an increase in pipeline transportation revenue and equity affiliate income, partially offset by higher operating expenses.On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites, a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 thousand barrel per day ("mbpd") allocation of space on the Colonial Pipeline. We refer to these assets as the “Galveston Bay 24Table of ContentsRefinery and Related Assets.” We paid $1.49 billion for these assets, which included $935 million for inventory. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. During the second quarter of 2014, we expect to pay BP approximately $178 million for the first year's contingent earnout. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Our financial results and operating statistics for the period prior to the acquisition does not include amounts for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition.Effective March 1, 2014, we sold MPLX a 13 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings for $310 million, increasing MPLX's ownership interest in Pipe Line Holdings to 69 percent. MPLX financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit agreement. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.In March 2014, we acquired from Chevron Raven Ridge Pipe Line Company an additional 7 percent interest in Explorer for $77 million, bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent. This increase in our ownership percentage requires us to now account for our investment in Explorer using the equity method of accounting and begin reporting Explorer as a related party. Explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Hammond, Indiana.In 2013, we agreed with Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. ("Enbridge") to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline, which will run from Beaver Lodge, North Dakota to Superior, Wisconsin and is targeted to be operational in early 2016. We also agreed to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project, which is currently estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. We made contributions of $37 million during the first quarter of 2014 and have contributed $61 million since project inception. In exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge's North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service. Enbridge's North Dakota System currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long. We will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements. See Notes 4 and 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.During the first three months of 2014, we paid $689 million to acquire 8 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $87.60 per delivered share. At March 31, 2014, we also had agreements to repurchase additional common shares for $12 million, which were settled in early April 2014. As of March 31, 2014, we had an outstanding repurchase authorization of $1.17 billion, which expires in September 2015. See Note 7 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of purchased products. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil ("LLS") prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Historically, West Texas Intermediate crude oil ("WTI") has traded at prices similar to LLS. During 2011 and continuing through the first half of 2013, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our Refining & Marketing gross margin. Logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets and other market factors acted to keep the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions. However, the differential between WTI and LLS significantly narrowed during the second half of 2013 before widening modestly late in the first quarter of 2014 due to a 25Table of Contentsvariety of domestic and international market conditions. Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors.The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.

Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. We had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Galveston Bay; Garyville, Louisiana; Robinson, Illinois and Catlettsburg, Kentucky refineries during the first quarter of 2014 compared to activities at our Catlettsburg, Garyville and Galveston Bay refineries during the first quarter of 2013.SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway's gross margin. Approximately two-thirds of Speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in the first quarter of 2014. Speedway's convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.Pipeline TransportationThe profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.26Table of ContentsResults of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2014 2013 VarianceRevenues and other income:     Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$23,285 $23,330 $(45)Income from equity method investments35 — 35Net gain on disposal of assets1 1 —Other income24 14 10Total revenues and other income23,345 23,345 —Costs and expenses:     Cost of revenues (excludes items below)20,540 20,034 506Purchases from related parties159 72 87Consumer excise taxes1,515 1,458 57Depreciation and amortization320 287 33Selling, general and administrative expenses346 249 97Other taxes104 89 15Total costs and expenses22,984 22,189 795Income from operations361 1,156 (795)Net interest and other financial income (costs)(46) (48) 2Income before income taxes315 1,108 (793)Provision for income taxes108 378 (270)Net income207 730 (523)Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests8 5 3Net income attributable to MPC$199 $725 $(526)Net income attributable to MPC decreased $526 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to a decrease in our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of $743 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013. The decrease in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and higher turnaround costs, partially offset by higher crack spreads and more favorable net product price realizations.Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) remained flat in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to the offsetting impacts of higher refined product sales volumes and lower refined product selling prices. Our consolidated refined product sales increased 69 mbpd in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013.Income from equity method investments increased $35 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in income from our ethanol investments of $24 million and an increase in income from our pipeline affiliates, including Explorer, of $11 million. The increase in income from our ethanol investments was primarily related to lower corn prices in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013 and the acquisition of interests in TAAE, TACE and TAEI in 2013.Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the first three months of 2014. At March 31, 2014, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If current business conditions remain unchanged and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of March 31, 2014, our equity investment in Centennial was $39 million and we had a $41 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial's outstanding debt. See Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.27Table of ContentsOther income increased $10 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in sales of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”), partially offset by a decrease in dividends received from a pipeline affiliate. Cost of revenues increased $506 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to higher refinery direct operating costs, including costs associated with significant turnaround activity at the Galveston Bay refinery, and an increase in purchased refined product volumes. These higher costs were partially offset by lower crude oil acquisition prices and a decrease in purchased charge and blendstocks volumes. Refinery direct operating costs increased $4.27 per barrel of throughput, and refined product purchase volumes increased 13 percent in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013. Crude oil acquisition prices decreased 3 percent and charge and blendstocks volumes decreased 16 percent compared to the same quarter last year.Purchases from related parties increased $87 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in purchases from LOOP of $43 million, largely related to higher crude oil purchases in the first quarter of 2014, purchases totaling $16 million from TAAE and $13 million from Explorer in the first quarter of 2014, which were not related parties during the first quarter of 2013, and an increase in feedstock purchases from Centennial of $9 million. Depreciation and amortization increased $33 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to accelerated depreciation of a unit at our Garyville refinery, the implementation of corporate-level information technology projects and our acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $97 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to pension settlement expenses of $64 million in the first quarter of 2014 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during the period and an increase in refinery and information technology contract services.Other taxes increased $15 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to increases in payroll taxes and sales and use tax expense. These increases were attributable to a number of factors including the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.Provision for income taxes decreased $270 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to the $793 million decrease in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 34 percent in the first quarter of 2014 and 2013. The effective tax rate for both periods is slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment. Factors that could affect the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment include, but are not limited to, a change in business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.28Table of ContentsSegment ResultsRevenues, including intersegment sales, are summarized by segment in the following table.

The higher merchandise sales was primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores. The higher gasoline and distillate sales were primarily due to an increase in gasoline and distillate sales volumes of 28 million gallons related to higher average sales volumes per convenience store and an increase in the number of convenience stores, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline and distillate selling prices of $0.12 per gallon.

These increases were partially offset by decreases in crude oil and refined products volumes transported. Crude oil pipeline throughput volumes decreased 128 mbpd and refined products pipeline throughput volumes decreased 98 mbpd in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013.The following table includes throughput volumes for the Pipeline Transportation segment.

These increases were primarily attributable to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013, which had significant turnaround and major maintenance activities during the first quarter of 2014 and higher operating costs per barrel of throughput than the average of our other six refineries.We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with purchased RINs increased to $71 million in the first quarter of 2014 from $43 million in the first quarter of 2013.Speedway segment income from operations decreased $9 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013. The severe weather conditions in the Midwest impacted all aspects of the business for the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in segment income was primarily due to a decrease in the gasoline and distillate gross margin of $0.0145 per gallon and higher operating expenses resulting from an increase in the number of stores and due to the difficult weather conditions in the first quarter of 2014. The negative impacts to segment income were partially offset by an increase in merchandise gross margin related to higher merchandise and food sales along with an increase in the number of convenience stores.The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment.

The increase primarily reflects an increase in pipeline transportation revenue and equity affiliate income, partially offset by higher operating expenses.We recorded pretax pension settlement expense of $64 million in the first quarter of 2014 resulting from the level of employee lump-sum retirement distributions that occurred during the period.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $2.17 billion at March 31, 2014 compared to $2.29 billion at December 31, 2013. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 are presented in the following table.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2014 2013Net cash provided by (used in):   Operating activities$766 $2,079Investing activities(360) (1,682)Financing activities(532) (520)Total$(126) $(123)Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.31 billion in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital of $908 million and the $523 million decrease in net income compared to the first quarter of 2013. Changes in working capital were a net $125 million source of cash in the first quarter of 2014 compared to a net $1.03 billion source of cash in the first quarter of 2013. The $125 million source of cash from working capital changes in the first quarter of 2014 was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in current receivables, partially offset by an increase in inventories. Accounts payable increased $1.08 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes and prices at the end of the first quarter of 2014 compared to year-end 2013. Current receivables decreased $139 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil receivable volumes, partially offset by higher refined product and crude oil prices. Inventories increased $1.00 billion from year-end 2013, primarily due to an increase in crude oil inventory volumes. 32Table of ContentsThe $1.03 billion source of cash in the first quarter of 2013 was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Accounts payable increased $2.09 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes related to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery in the first quarter of 2013 and lower crude oil purchases at the end of 2012 in preparation for turnaround and major maintenance activity. In addition, accounts payable increased due to higher crude oil prices at the end of the first quarter of 2013 compared to year-end 2012. Accrued liabilities increased $404 million from year-end 2012, primarily due to an increase in accrued taxes associated with timing of federal income tax payments. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was partially offset by higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes and increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $1.32 billion in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets acquisition in February 2013, partially offset by higher capital expenditures in our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments in the first quarter of 2014.The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows.

See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.(b) Includes capitalized interest of $6 million and $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.The acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets comprised 87 percent of our total capital spending in the first quarter of 2013.Net cash used in investments in affiliates increased $113 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to our acquisition of an additional 7 percent interest in Explorer for $77 million and our contributions to North Dakota Pipeline of $37 million to fund our portion of the Sandpiper pipeline project in the first quarter of 2014. Net cash used in financing activities increased $12 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013. The uses of cash for both periods were primarily for common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plans and dividend payments, partially offset in the first quarter of 2014 by long-term debt borrowings by MPLX.Cash provided by long-term debt borrowings was $270 million in the first quarter of 2014. MPLX borrowed $270 million under its revolving credit agreement to fund MPLX's acquisition of an additional interest in Pipe Line Holdings. 33Table of ContentsCash used in common stock repurchases under the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors increased $258 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013. During the first quarter of 2014, we paid $689 million to repurchase 8 million common shares compared to $431 million paid to repurchase 5 million shares through open market repurchases during the first quarter of 2013. See Note 7 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.Cash used in dividend payments increased $7 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to a 7 cent per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our dividend payments were $0.42 per common share in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $0.35 per common share in the first quarter of 2013.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.Capital ResourcesAs of March 31, 2014, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreement or our trade receivables securitization facility. MPLX had $270 million in borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit agreement at March 31, 2014. Our liquidity totaled $5.97 billion at March 31, 2014 consisting of:(In millions) March 31, 2014Cash and cash equivalents$2,166Revolving credit agreement(a)2,500Trade receivables securitization facility1,300Total$5,966(a) Excludes MPLX’s $500 million revolving credit agreement, which had $230 million available as of March 31, 2014.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.Our revolving credit agreement (the “MPC Credit Agreement”) and the MPLX Credit Agreement contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of March 31, 2014, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.17 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPC Credit Agreement.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). As of March 31, 2014, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 2.2 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of March 31, 2014, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.Rating AgencyRatingMoody’sBaa2 (positive outlook)Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.34Table of ContentsNeither the MPC Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the MPC Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 25 percent at March 31, 2014 and 23 percent at December 31, 2013.(In millions)March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013Long-term debt due within one year$24 $23Long-term debt3,635 3,373Total debt$3,659 $3,396Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$3,659 $3,396Total equity10,758 11,332Total capital$14,417 $14,728Debt-to-total-capital ratio25% 23%Capital RequirementsWe have a capital and investment budget for 2014 of $2.43 billion, excluding capitalized interest. The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. During the three months ended March 31, 2014, our capital expenditures and investments were $365 million, excluding capitalized interest. There have been no material changes to our 2014 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we may be required to pay to the seller a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. During the second quarter of 2014, we expect to pay BP approximately $178 million for the first year's contingent earnout. See Notes 4 and 13 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.MPLX had $270 million in borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit agreement at March 31, 2014.During the three months ended March 31, 2014, we made no contributions to our funded pension plans. We have no required funding for 2014 but may do so at our discretion.On April 30, 2014, our board of directors approved a 42 cents per share dividend, payable June 10, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 21, 2014.During the first three months of 2014, we paid $689 million to acquire 8 million common shares through open market share repurchases. We also entered into agreements to acquire additional common shares for $12 million, which were settled in early April 2014. As of March 31, 2014, we had total outstanding repurchase authorizations pursuant to the authorization announced on September 26, 2013 of $1.17 billion, which expires in September 2015.We may utilize various methods to effect additional repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.35Table of ContentsContractual Cash ObligationsAs of March 31, 2014, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first three months of 2014, the MPLX Credit Agreement committed payments increased $282 million due to borrowing on the MPLX Credit Agreement to purchase the additional interest in Pipe Line Holdings, including interest and fees. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million ("ppm") beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards. There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2014.36Table of ContentsCritical Accounting EstimatesThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2014.Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedIn April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which redefines the criteria for determining discontinued operations and introduces new disclosures related to these disposals. The updated definition of a discontinued operation is the disposal of a component(s) of an entity or the classification of a component(s) of an entity as held for sale which represents a strategic shift for an entity and has (or will have) a major impact on an entity's operations and financial results. The standard requires disclosure of additional financial information for discontinued operations and individually material components not qualifying for discontinued operation presentation, as well as information regarding an entity's continuing involvement with the discontinued operation. The accounting standards update is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this standards update in the first quarter of 2015 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.37Table of ContentsItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.See Notes 13 and 14 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of March 31, 2014 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after March 31, 2014 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt as of March 31, 2014 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.

At March 31, 2014, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.38Table of ContentsItem 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2014, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2014, we implemented an Enterprise Resource Planning system for core financial and procurement processes. As a result of the implementation, certain internal controls have changed. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.39Table of ContentsSupplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions)2014 2013Income from Operations by segment   Refining & Marketing$362 $1,105Speedway58 67Pipeline Transportation(a)72 51Items not allocated to segments:    Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(67) (67) Pension settlement expenses(64) —Income from operations$361 $1,156Capital Expenditures and Investments(b)(c)   Refining & Marketing$178 $1,420Speedway32 36Pipeline Transportation130 90Corporate and Other(d)31 28Total$371 $1,574(a) Corporate overhead costs attributable to MPLX are included in the Pipeline Transportation segment.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment.LitigationWe are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Environmental ProceedingsWe are involved in a number of environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Item 1A.
