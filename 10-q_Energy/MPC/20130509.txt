Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.  Corporate Overview  We are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered.  Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer.        •    Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway business segment and to dealers and jobbers who operate Marathon® retail outlets;        •    Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway® convenience stores; and        •    Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX and MPC’s retained pipeline assets and investments.  Executive Summary  Net income attributable to MPC was $725 million, or $2.17 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $596 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment, which generated segment income from operations of $1.11 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $943 million in the first quarter of 2012. The increase in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was primarily due to an increase in refined product sales volumes related to the recently acquired Galveston Bay refinery, partially offset by a lower refining and marketing gross margin, which was $7.92 per barrel in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $8.36 per barrel in the first quarter of 2012.    28    Table of Contents Speedway segment income from operations increased $17 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillates gross margin and our merchandise gross margin, partially offset by higher expenses attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores.  Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $9 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The increase primarily reflects higher transportation tariffs and income from pipeline affiliates, partially offset by higher mechanical integrity and depreciation expenses.  On February 1, 2013, we paid $1.49 billion to acquire from BP the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, an allocation of BP’s Colonial Pipeline Company shipper history, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites and a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility, as well as the inventory associated with these assets. We refer to these assets as the “Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets”. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Information for periods prior to the acquisition does not include amounts for these operations. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition.  On January 30, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The board also extended the remaining $650 million share repurchase authorization announced on February 1, 2012, for a total outstanding authorization of $2.65 billion through December 2014.  On February 5, 2013, the $500 million ASR program entered into on November 5, 2012 was concluded with the delivery of 870,947 shares to us. The 8,274,241 total shares repurchased under this ASR program was based generally on the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the repurchase period. Upon final settlement, the average per share cost for all shares purchased under this ASR program was $60.43.  During the three months ended March 31, 2013, we paid $431 million to acquire 5,105,842 common shares through open market share repurchases, which was an average per share cost of $84.45, and we entered into agreements to acquire an additional 345,432 common shares for $31 million which were settled in April 2013.  Overview of Segments  Refining & Marketing  Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining and marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.  Our refining and marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses, including depreciation and amortization. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil (“LLS”) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent sulfur residual fuel) are used for these crack-spread calculations.  Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our refining and marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and marketing gross margin.    29    Table of Contents Historically, West Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”) has traded at prices similar to LLS. During the first quarters of 2013 and 2012, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our refining and marketing gross margin. The logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets have prevented the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions. Future differentials will be dependent on changes made to the logistical infrastructure.  The following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in annual net income, including the impact of the Galveston Bay refinery, due to potential changes in market conditions.

(b)   LLS (prompt)—[delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].    (c)   Assumes 20% of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.  In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our refining and marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:        •    the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;        •    the selling prices realized for refined products;        •    the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk;        •    the cost of products purchased for resale; and        •    changes in manufacturing costs, which include depreciation and amortization.  Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. We had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Garyville, Louisiana; and Galveston Bay refineries during the first quarter of 2013 compared to activities at our Garyville refinery during the first quarter of 2012.  Speedway  Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillates, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillates demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillates generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile. Approximately two-thirds of Speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in the first quarter of 2013.    30    Table of Contents Pipeline Transportation  The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. In the fourth quarter of 2012, new transportation services agreements were entered into between MPC and MPLX, which resulted in higher tariff rates. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillates peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.

Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $3.06 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes, which increased to 1,895 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) in the first quarter of 2013 from 1,558 mbpd in the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the recently acquired Galveston Bay refinery. This impact was partially offset by a decrease in refined product selling prices.  Other income increased $8 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to increases in sales of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) and dividends from pipeline affiliates.  Cost of revenues increased $2.71 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in purchased crude oil volumes in the Refining & Marketing segment, primarily associated with the recently acquired Galveston Bay refinery. We also had increases in purchased other charge and blendstocks and refined product volumes. These impacts were partially offset by decreased prices for crude oil and other charge and blendstocks. Crude oil volumes were up 24 percent, other charge and blendstocks volumes were up 35 percent and refined product volumes were up 12 percent. Crude oil acquisition prices were down four percent and charge and blendstock prices were down six percent.  Purchases from related parties increased $9 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to higher acquisition costs of ethanol from our ethanol investments due to higher ethanol prices and an increase in ethanol volumes purchased, partially offset by a decrease in purchases from Centennial.  Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that continued through the first quarter of 2013. At March 31, 2013, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial and concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on various uses of Centennial’s assets.  Depreciation and amortization increased $57 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan refinery and our acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.  Other taxes increased $15 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to increases in personal property taxes and payroll taxes. These increases were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery, the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets and Speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012.  Net interest and other financial costs increased $26 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily reflecting a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. We capitalized interest of $4 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $30 million in the first quarter of 2012.  Provision for income taxes increased $40 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to the $174 million increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate, which decreased from 36 percent in the first quarter of 2012 to 34 percent in the first quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2013 is less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, partially offset by state and local tax expense. See Note 11 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further details.    32    Table of Contents Segment Results  Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table.

Our Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes were 1,880 mbpd in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 1,532 mbpd in the first quarter of 2012. Our average Refining & Marketing segment refined product selling prices were $2.98 per gallon in first quarter of 2013 compared to $3.07 per gallon in first quarter of 2012.

Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 688 million gallons in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 608 million gallons in the first quarter of 2012, with the increased volumes primarily due to Speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012.  Speedway segment revenues increased $157 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to a 39 million gallon increase in gasoline and distillates sales volumes. Gasoline and distillates selling prices averaged $3.51 per gallon in both the first quarters of 2013 and 2012. The Speedway segment also had higher merchandise sales in the first quarter of 2013. The increases in gasoline and distillates sales volumes and merchandise sales were primarily due to the acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012.  Pipeline Transportation segment revenue increased $26 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to higher transportation tariffs, primarily from our crude oil pipelines, resulting from increased tariff rates in the last half of 2012 and the startup of a new crude oil pipeline in the first quarter of 2012.    33    Table of Contents Income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are presented in the following table.

(d)  LLS (prompt)—[delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].  Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $162 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to a 348 mbpd increase in refined product sales volumes in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The increase in refined product sales volumes was primarily attributable to the recently acquired Galveston Bay refinery. The increase in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was partially offset by a lower refining and marketing gross margin per barrel, which averaged $7.92 per barrel in the first quarter of 2013 compared to $8.36 per barrel in the first quarter of 2012. Our realized Refining & Marketing gross margin for the first quarter of 2013 benefited from increases in the Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread of $1.85 per barrel and the LLS—WTI differential of $2.88 per barrel. However, we experienced higher operating and turnaround costs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. In addition, our average crude oil acquisition discount narrowed compared to LLS in the first quarter of 2013.    34    Table of Contents The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs for the first quarters of 2013 and 2012.

Within our refining system, sour crude accounted for 54 percent and 47 percent of our crude oil processed in the first quarters of 2013 and 2012, respectively.  The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment for the first quarters of 2013 and 2012.

(b)   Per barrel of total refinery throughputs.    (c)   Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs.    (d)   Includes intersegment sales.  Direct operating costs in the Refining & Marketing gross margin increased $0.79 per barrel of total refinery throughputs, which includes a $0.65 per barrel increase in other manufacturing costs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. This increase was primarily attributable to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery, which had higher operating costs per barrel of throughput than the average of our other six refineries due to its greater level of complexity.  Our cost of complying with the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) renewable fuel standards increased to $43 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $31 million in the first quarter of 2012 due to increases in our ethanol and advanced RIN obligations. The increase in the cost of our ethanol RIN obligation was primarily due to higher ethanol RIN prices. The increase in the cost of our advanced RIN obligation was primarily due to an increase in our biomass-based diesel RIN requirement attributable to the Galveston Bay refinery, partially offset by lower biomass-based diesel RIN prices.  Speedway segment income from operations increased $17 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillates gross margin and our merchandise gross margin, partially offset by higher expenses attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores. The increase in our gasoline and distillates gross margin was primarily due to a $0.0205 increase in our gross margin per gallon along with higher sales volumes related to the increase in the number of convenience stores. The increase in the merchandise gross margin was primarily due to higher merchandise sales resulting from an increase in the number of convenience stores.    35    Table of Contents The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Speedway segment for the first quarters of 2013 and 2012.                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,        2013     2012     Convenience stores at period-end     1,463       1,370     Gasoline & distillates sales (millions of gallons)     745       706     Gasoline & distillates gross margin (dollars per gallon)(a)   $ 0.1301     $ 0.1096     Merchandise sales (in millions)   $ 711     $ 695     Merchandise gross margin (in millions)   $ 184     $ 179        (a)  The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, divided by gasoline and distillates sales volume.  Same-store gasoline sales volume increased 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, while same-store merchandise sales excluding cigarettes increased 0.8 percent for the same period.  Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $9 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The increase primarily reflects higher transportation tariffs and income from pipeline affiliates, partially offset by higher mechanical integrity and depreciation expenses.  Items not allocated to segments decreased $12 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in pension expenses resulting from a pension plan amendment adopted in the second quarter of 2012. Although the pension plan amendment has resulted in lower pension expenses for 2013, we could potentially have recognition of pension settlement losses later this year, which would increase pension expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash Flows  Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $4.74 billion at March 31, 2013 compared to $4.86 billion at December 31, 2012. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first quarters of 2013 and 2012 are presented in the following table.                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,     (In millions)   2013     2012     Net cash provided by (used in):             Operating activities   $ 2,079     $ 347     Investing activities     (1,682 )      (311 )    Financing activities     (520 )      (910 )                          Total   $ (123 )    $ (874 )                         Net cash provided by operating activities increased $1.73 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to changes in working capital.    36    Table of Contents Changes in working capital were a net $1.03 billion source of cash in the first quarter of 2013 compared to a net $761 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2012. The $1.03 billion source of cash in the first quarter of 2013 was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Accounts payable increased $2.09 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes related to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery in the first quarter of 2013 and lower crude oil purchases at the end of 2012 in preparation for turnaround and major maintenance activity. In addition, accounts payable increased due to higher crude oil prices at the end of the first quarter of 2013 compared to year-end 2012. Accrued liabilities increased $404 million from year-end 2012, primarily due to an increase in accrued taxes associated with timing of federal income tax payments. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was partially offset by higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes and increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. The $761 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2012 was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable caused by higher refined product prices as well as lower crude oil payable volumes as a result of changes in crude supply.  Net cash used in investing activities totaled $1.68 billion in the first quarter of 2013, compared to $311 million in the first quarter of 2012. The higher use of cash in the first quarter of 2013 was primarily due to the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets acquisition in February 2013.  The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash.

See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.    (b)   Includes $70 million for the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.    (c)   Includes capitalized interest of $4 million and $30 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.    37    Table of Contents The acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets comprised 87 percent of our total capital spending in the first quarter of 2013. The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, which we completed in 2012, comprised 65 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in the first quarter of 2012.  Net cash used in financing activities totaled $520 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $910 million in the first quarter of 2012. The uses of cash in the first quarters of 2013 and 2012 were primarily for common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plan and dividend payments.  Cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $431 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $850 million in the first quarter of 2012 associated with the share repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. We repurchased 5,105,842 common shares through open market repurchases during the first quarter of 2013 at an average cost of $84.45 per share. We entered into an $850 million ASR program on February 3, 2012, under which we repurchased 20,357,380 shares through July 2012 at an average cost of $41.75 per share. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase plan.  Cash used in dividend payments increased $29 million in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to a 10 cents per share increase in our base dividend payment, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our quarterly dividend payment was 35 cents per common share in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 25 cents per common share in the first quarter of 2012.  Derivative Instruments  See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.  Capital Resources  As of March 31, 2013, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreements or our trade receivables securitization facility and our liquidity totaled $8.24 billion consisting of:             (In millions)   March 31,2013     Cash and cash equivalents   $ 4,737     Revolving credit agreement(a)     2,500     Trade receivables securitization facility     1,000                 Total   $ 8,237                    (a)  Excludes MPLX’s revolving credit agreement.  Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.  Our revolving credit agreement (the “MPC Credit Agreement”) and MPLX’s revolving credit agreement (the “MPLX Credit Agreement”) contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of March 31, 2013, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of -0.02 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPC Credit Agreement.    38    Table of Contents The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). As of March 31, 2013, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 0.1 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.  Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of March 31, 2013, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.           Rating Agency     Rating    Moody’s   Baa2 (positive outlook)   Standard & Poor’s   BBB (stable outlook)  The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.  Neither the MPC Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the MPC Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility and could potentially impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis.  Debt-to-Total-Capital Ratio  Our debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 22 percent at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. There have been no material changes to our 2013 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.  Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we may be required to pay to the seller a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.    39    Table of Contents As of March 31, 2013, we plan to make additional contributions of approximately $160 million to our funded pension plans in 2013.  On April 24, 2013, our board of directors approved a 35 cents per share dividend, payable June 10, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 16, 2013.  On January 30, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The board also extended the remaining $650 million share repurchase authorization announced on February 1, 2012, for a total outstanding authorization of $2.65 billion through December 2014. During the first quarter of 2013, the final 870,947 shares from the $500 million ASR program were delivered to us and we paid $431 million to acquire 5,105,842 common shares through open market share repurchases. At March 31, 2013, we had an outstanding authorization of $2.22 billion available for repurchases. In addition, during the first quarter of 2013, we entered into agreements to acquire an additional 345,432 common shares for $31 million, which were settled in April 2013.  We may utilize various methods to effect additional repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, ASRs or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.  The above discussion of the share repurchase authorization includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.    40    Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations  The following table provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of March 31, 2013.

(b)   Includes both short- and long-term purchases obligations.    (c)   These contracts include variable price arrangements with estimated prices to be paid primarily based on current market conditions. We are in the process of implementing systems that will allow us to estimate prices based on futures curves, which as of March 31, 2013, has been implemented for contracts with purchase obligations of $1.31 billion.    (d)   Includes obligations to advance funds to equity method investees.    (e)   Includes $700 million of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.    (f)   Primarily includes contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.    (g)   Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2022. See Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.  We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies.    41    Table of Contents  The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.  Transactions with Related Parties  We believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.  Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs  We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.  On January 25, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit vacated the 2012 cellulosic biofuel requirements under the EPA renewable fuel standard (“RFS2”) program. In light of this ruling, the EPA is reconsidering and is anticipated to lower the 2011 and 2012 cellulosic biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. The EPA also has proposed a rule establishing a quality assurance program for RINs purchased to help meet the annual biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. This rule should be finalized later this year and is aimed at reducing the chances that RINs are fraudulently created or sold.  On March 29, 2013, the EPA announced its proposed Tier 3 fuel standards. The proposed Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower allowable sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million by January 1, 2017. The EPA is accepting public comments on the standards and the agency is expected to finalize the Tier 3 fuel standards later this year. Our cost of compliance may be material; however, we will likely not be able to reasonably estimate our compliance costs until we have had time to review the final standards and develop our compliance plans.  There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2013.  Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The following critical accounting estimates have been updated since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 was filed.    42    Table of Contents Fair Value Estimates  Acquisitions  In accounting for business combinations, acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other assets and liabilities. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance.  The fair value of assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity specific differences. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions.  Derivatives  We record all derivative instruments at fair value. All of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value.  Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  As of March 31, 2013, there are no accounting standards that have not yet been adopted.    43    Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  For a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.  See Notes 14 and 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.  Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of March 31, 2013 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.  We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after March 31, 2013 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.  Sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point shift in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2013 is provided in the following table.

Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.    (b)   Excludes capital leases.    (c)  Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.    (d)   Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at March 31, 2013.  At March 31, 2013, our portfolio of long-term debt was substantially comprised of fixed-rate instruments. Therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value.    44    Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2013, the end of the period covered by this report.  Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the quarter ended March 31, 2013, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.    45    Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited)                    Three Months EndedMarch 31,     (In millions)   2013     2012     Income from Operations by segment             Refining & Marketing   $ 1,105     $ 943     Speedway     67       50     Pipeline Transportation(a)     51       42     Items not allocated to segments(a)     (67 )      (79 )                          Income from operations   $ 1,156     $ 956                           Capital Expenditures and Investments(b)(c)             Refining & Marketing   $ 1,420     $ 153     Speedway     36       11     Pipeline Transportation     90       38     Corporate and Other(d)     28       38                           Total   $ 1,574     $ 240                              (a)   Included in the Pipeline Transportation segment are $5 million of corporate overhead costs attributable to MPLX, which were included in items not allocated to segments prior to MPLX’s October 31, 2012 initial public offering.
