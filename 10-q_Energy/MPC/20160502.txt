Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream services company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.8 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Northeast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest terminal operations in the United States and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,770 convenience stores in 22 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,500 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.Through our ownership interests in MPLX and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MarkWest, we believe we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the United States, the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions and we distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets. Our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. Our assets include approximately 5,400 MMcf/d of gathering capacity, 7,300 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 500 mbpd of fractionation capacity. We also own more than 5,000 miles of gas gathering and NGL pipelines and have ownership interests in more than 50 gas processing plants, more than 10 NGL fractionation facilities and one condensate stabilization facility. We own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,400 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX. In previous periods, our inland marine business and our investment in an ocean vessel joint venture, (Crowley Ocean Partners), were presented within our Refining & Marketing segment. They are now presented in our Midstream segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation.Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience merchandise in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. 32Table of Contents •Midstream – includes the operations of MPLX and certain other related operations. The Midstream segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs and transports and stores crude oil and refined products. Executive SummaryResultsSelect results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions, except per share data) 2016 2015Income from Operations by segment   Refining & Marketing$(62) $1,292Speedway167 168Midstream(a)167 90Net income attributable to MPC$1 $891Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$0.003 $1.62(a) Excludes impairment charge of $129 million as discussed in Acquisitions and Investments.Net income attributable to MPC was $1 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $891 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2015. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $1.35 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $6.16 per barrel decrease in gross margin, resulting from lower crack spreads, unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark LLS crude oil and higher direct operating costs related to increased turnaround activity. These decreases were partially offset by more favorable product price realizations and the favorable effects of changes in market structure compared to the spot market reference prices. The Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread decreased from $9.69 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016. Speedway segment income from operations decreased $1 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The results are consistent with first quarter of 2015 as lower light product margins and higher operating expenses were offset by higher merchandise margins, an increase in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location. Midstream segment income from operations increased $77 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, the increase was primarily due to operating results from MarkWest following the MarkWest Merger, which was effective December 4, 2015. MPLX LPAs of March 31, 2016, we owned a 25 percent interest in MPLX, including a two percent general partner interest. On December 4, 2015, MPLX completed the MarkWest Merger. The total value of consideration transferred was $8.61 billion, consisting of $7.33 billion in equity and $1.28 billion in cash. At closing, we made a payment of $1.23 billion to MarkWest common unitholders and the remaining $50 million will be paid in equal amounts in July 2016 and July 2017, respectively, in connection with the conversion of the MPLX Class B units to MPLX common units. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the MarkWest Merger.Contribution of Inland Marine Business to MPLXOn March 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to MPLX in exchange for 23 million MPLX common units and 460 thousand general partner units. The number of units we received from MPLX was determined by dividing $600 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for the 10 trading days preceding March 14, 2016, pursuant to the Membership Interests Contribution Agreement. We also agreed to waive first-quarter 2016 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions, with respect to the common units issued in this transaction. The contribution of our inland marine business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss. 33Table of Contents ATM ProgramOn March 4, 2016, MPLX filed a prospectus supplement to its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on March 27, 2015, authorizing the continuous issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings (such continuous offering program, or at-the-market program, referred to as the “ATM Program”). During the three months ended March 31, 2016, MPLX issued an aggregate of 12 million common units under the ATM Program, generating net proceeds of approximately $315 million. As a result of common units issued under the ATM Program during the period, we contributed approximately $6 million in exchange for general partner units to maintain our two percent general partner interest. Distributions from MPLXThe following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during the first three months of 2016 and 2015.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2016 2015Cash distributions received from MPLX:   General partner distributions, including IDRs$40 $2Limited partner distributions29 22Total$69 $24The market value of the 79.5 million MPLX common units we owned at March 31, 2016 was $2.4 billion based on the March 31, 2016 closing unit price of $29.69. Over time, we also believe there will be substantial value attributable to our two percent general partnership interest.On April 19, 2016, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.5050 per common unit payable on May 13, 2016. As a result, MPLX will make distributions totaling $200 million to its limited and general partners. MPC’s portion of these distributions is approximately $73 million. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.Acquisitions and InvestmentsOn December 4, 2015, MPLX merged with MarkWest, whereby MarkWest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX. Each common unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the MarkWest Merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of MPLX representing limited partner interests in MPLX, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 per unit. Each Class B unit of MarkWest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one Class B unit of MPLX having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations that the Class B units of MarkWest had immediately prior to the merger. At closing, we contributed $1.23 billion in cash to MPLX to pay the cash consideration to MarkWest common unitholders. We will contribute an additional total of $50 million in cash to MPLX for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the MPLX Class B units to MPLX common units in equal installments in July 2016 and July 2017, respectively. These contributions are with respect to MPC’s existing interests in MPLX (including IDRs) and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in MPLX. We assigned the total consideration transferred of $8.61 billion, including the $7.33 billion fair value of the equity consideration and the $1.28 billion of cash contributions, to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interest assumed in the MarkWest Merger, with the excess recorded as goodwill. During the first quarter of 2016, the preliminary fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded in the 2015 year-end financial statements were revised based on additional analysis. These adjustments to the fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and equity investments, among other items, resulted in an offsetting reduction to goodwill of approximately $241 million. As a result, we recognized total assets acquired of $11.91 billion, including $8.52 billion of property plant and equipment and $2.60 billion of equity investments, and total liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed of $5.51 billion, including $4.57 billion of assumed debt. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances. During the first quarter of 2016, MPLX recorded an impairment charge of $129 million to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a discussion of this interim assessment of goodwill. See Note 14 for information on goodwill recorded from the MarkWest Merger. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the acquisition.34Table of Contents Consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business, the MarkWest Merger combines one of the nation’s largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by MPC. The complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of MarkWest, MPLX and MPC provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. The combined entity will further MarkWest's leading midstream presence in the Marcellus and Utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects, which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions. In addition, the combination provides significant vertical integration opportunities, as MPC is a large consumer of NGLs.In September 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a new joint venture with Crowley Maritime Corporation through our investment in Crowley Ocean Partners. The joint venture will operate and charter four new Jones Act product tankers, most of which will be leased to MPC. The new vessels are in various stages of construction with two of them completed and operational prior to the end of the first quarter. Contributions to the joint venture with respect to each vessel will occur at the vessel’s delivery. During 2015, we contributed $72 million in connection with delivery of the first two vessels. The third vessel was delivered April 15, 2016 and the remaining vessel is expected to be delivered by the third quarter of 2016. We account for our ownership interest in Crowley Ocean Partners as an equity method investment. In the first quarter of 2016, we revised our internal reporting of operating results for our investment in Crowley Ocean Partners. These operating results are now reported in our Midstream segment. Previously they were reported as part of our Refining & Marketing segment. Prior periods have been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation. See Note 22 for information on our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of the joint venture and future contributions to Crowley Ocean Partners. In November 2013, we agreed to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline project and fund 37.5 percent of the construction costs of the project, which will become part of Enbridge Energy Partners North Dakota System. In exchange for these commitments, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge Energy Partners’ North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service. We also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements. The anticipated in-service date for the pipeline is likely to be delayed from 2017 to early 2019, which is also likely to increase cost estimates for the project. The project schedule and cost estimates remain under review. We made contributions of $5 million to North Dakota Pipeline Company during the first quarter of 2016 and have contributed $292 million since project inception. We account for our interest in North Dakota Pipeline as part of our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting. See Note 22 for information on future contributions to North Dakota Pipeline.Share Repurchases Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.31 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.69 billion available for repurchases. During the first three months of 2016, we have acquired 2 million common shares at an average cost per share of $43.96 under these authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.LiquidityAs of March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $308 million, an unused $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility and approximately $426 million of availability under our $1.0 billion trade receivables securitization facility based on eligible trade receivables. Availability under MPC’s trade receivables facility is a function of eligible accounts receivable, which will be lower in a sustained lower refined product price environment. As of March 31, 2016, we have $188 million of commercial paper outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. The above amounts exclude MPLX’s $2.0 billion bank revolving credit facility, which as of March 31, 2016, had $326 million borrowings and $8 million letters of credit outstanding. 35Table of Contents The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our business strategies and growth and vertical integration opportunities with respect to our midstream assets, the timing of delivery of the vessel to Crowley Ocean Partners, the estimated construction costs and completion of the Sandpiper pipeline projects and our share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect our business strategies and growth and vertical integration opportunities with respect to our midstream assets include, but are not limited to, volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions, our ability to implement and realize the benefits and synergies of our strategic initiatives, availability of liquidity, actions taken by competitors, regulatory approvals and operating performance. Factors that could affect delivery of the vessel to Crowley Ocean Partners include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and the ability to complete the vessel on the anticipated terms and timetable. Factors that could affect the estimated construction costs, timing and completion of the Sandpiper pipeline project, include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ULSD and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like Brent crude. In recent years, domestic U.S. crude oils, such as WTI and LLS, have traded at prices less than Brent due to the growth in U.S. crude oil production, logistical constraints and other market factors. These price discounts had favorably impacted the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. The decline in crude oil prices in 2015 and continuing into the first quarter of 2016 has led to declines in sequential (month on month) onshore U.S. crude oil production and narrowed the LLS discount to Brent. With the end of the ban on U.S. crude oil exports, LLS and Brent are expected to trade near parity. Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax)  LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)$450Sweet/sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)220LLS-WTI differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)90Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change)140(a) Weighted 40 percent Chicago and 60 percent USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.(b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].(c) Assumes 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.36Table of Contents In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;•our refinery yields;•the selling prices realized for refined products;•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; •the cost of products purchased for resale; •the potential impact of lower of cost or market adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices; and•the impact of liquidations of LIFO inventory layers with costs significantly above current market prices.Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. The December 31, 2015 lower of cost or market reserve of $345 million was reversed due to the sale of inventory quantities that gave rise to the 2015 reserve. A new lower of cost or market reserve of $360 million was established as of March 31, 2016 based on market conditions and prices at that time. The effect of the change in lower of cost or market reserve was a $15 million charge to cost of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover. The cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks, refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the LIFO method. There were no liquidations of LIFO inventories for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Costs for planned turnaround, major maintenance and engineering projects are expensed in the period incurred. We had significantly more planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries during the first three months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, transportation fuel prices, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway’s gross margin. Speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items. 37Table of Contents Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. The December 31, 2015 lower of cost or market reserve was reversed due to the sale of inventory quantities that gave rise to the 2015 reserve. A new lower of cost or market reserve of $25 million was established as of March 31, 2016 based on market conditions and prices at that time. There was no charge to cost of revenues for the effect of the lower of cost or market reserve for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative or positive effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover. MidstreamNGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability. The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines and marine vessels serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.38Table of Contents Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2016 2015 VarianceRevenues and other income:     Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$12,755 $17,191 $(4,436)Income from equity method investments22 15 7Net gain on disposal of assets 25 5 20Other income28 29 (1)Total revenues and other income12,830 17,240 (4,410)Costs and expenses:     Cost of revenues (excludes items below)9,701 13,044 (3,343)Purchases from related parties107 76 31Inventory market valuation charge15 — 15Consumer excise taxes1,826 1,832 (6)Impairment expense129 — 129Depreciation and amortization490 363 127Selling, general and administrative expenses378 358 20Other taxes109 97 12Total costs and expenses12,755 15,770 (3,015)Income from operations75 1,470 (1,395)Net interest and other financial income (costs)(142) (81) (61)Income (loss) before income taxes(67) 1,389 (1,456)Provision for income taxes11 486 (475)Net income (loss)(78) 903 (981)Less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests(79) 12 (91)Net income attributable to MPC$1 $891 $(890)Net income attributable to MPC decreased $890 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations, which decreased $1.35 billion in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2015. This decrease was partially offset by a $475 million decrease in our provision for income taxes and an increase in Midstream segment income of $77 million. The decrease for the Refining & Marketing segment in the first quarter was primarily due to a $6.16 per barrel decrease in gross margin, resulting from lower crack spreads, unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark LLS crude oil and higher direct operating costs related to increased turnaround activity. These decreases were partially offset by more favorable product price realizations and the favorable effects of changes in market structure compared to the spot market reference prices. The Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread decreased from $9.69 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016.Speedway segment income was consistent with the first quarter of the prior year. The increase in Midstream segment income was primarily due to operating results from MarkWest following the MarkWest Merger, which was effective December 4, 2015.Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $4.44 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices and volumes. For the first quarter of 2016, average refined product sales prices decreased $0.50 per gallon and refined product sales volumes decreased 85 mbpd.39Table of Contents Income from equity method investments increased $7 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to increases in income from our pipeline and NGL affiliates, partially offset by a decrease in income from our ethanol affiliates. Net gain on disposal of assets increased $20 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016.Cost of revenues decreased $3.34 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to:•a decrease in refined product cost of sales of $3.4 billion, primarily due to decreases in raw material costs; and•an increase in refinery direct operating costs of $230 million, or $1.64 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to increased significant planned turnaround activity in 2016. Purchases from related parties increased $31 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to:•an increase in volume purchased from Illinois Extension Pipeline of $27 million;•an increase in purchases from Crowley Ocean Partners of $6 million;•an increase in volume purchased from Ohio Condensate of $3 million;•a decrease in volume purchased from Explorer of $5 million; and •a decrease in prices for ethanol purchases from TAME, TACE, and TAAE of $3 million. Inventory market valuation charge increased $15 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The December 31, 2015 lower of cost or market reserve of $370 million was reversed due to the sale of inventory quantities that gave rise to the 2015 reserve. A new lower of cost or market reserve of $385 million was established as of March 31, 2016 based on market conditions and prices at that time. The effect of the change in lower of cost or market reserve was a $15 million charge to cost of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016.Consumer excise taxes decreased $6 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decrease in taxable refined product sales volumes.Impairment expense reflects a $129 million impairment charge recorded by MPLX in the first quarter of 2016 to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a discussion of the interim impairment assessment of goodwill.Depreciation and amortization increased $127 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired from MarkWest in our Midstream segment.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $20 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to costs associated with MarkWest, partially offset by a decrease in employee benefit expenses.Other taxes increased $12 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to property taxes on MarkWest properties. Net interest and other financial costs increased $61 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to interest on the debt assumed in the MarkWest Merger. Provision for income taxes decreased $475 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decrease of $1.46 billion in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2016 was significantly affected by permanent differences related to the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, including their proportionate share of the goodwill impairment charge recorded by MPLX. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest reduced the effective rate by 51 percent from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, the effective tax rate is equivalent to the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense.40Table of Contents Segment ResultsRevenuesRevenues, including intersegment sales, are summarized by segment in the following table.

The decrease in intersegment refined product sales was primarily due to lower refined product sales prices partially offset by higher volumes. The table below shows our Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment. Three Months Ended  March 31, 2016 2015Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to Speedway:   Intersegment sales (in millions)$2,165 $2,734Refined product sales volumes (millions of gallons)1,448 1,388Average refined product sales prices (dollars per gallon)$1.49 $1.96Speedway segment revenues decreased $580 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to decreases in gasoline and distillate sales of $617 million, partially offset by increases in merchandise sales of $41 million. The decreases in gasoline and distillate sales were primarily due to decreases in average gasoline and distillate selling prices of $0.49 per gallon, partially offset by volume increases of 51 million gallons. The following table includes certain revenue statistics for the Speedway segment.

Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $1.35 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $6.16 per barrel decrease in gross margin, resulting from lower crack spreads, unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark LLS crude oil and higher direct operating costs related to increased turnaround activity. These decreases were partially offset by more favorable product price realizations and the favorable effects of changes in market structure compared to the spot market reference prices. The Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread decreased from $9.69 per barrel in the first quarter of 2015 to $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016.The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment’s business.

The positive effect from the increased volume of sour crude was partially offset by the narrowing of the sweet/sour crude oil differential by $0.31 per barrel resulting in a positive impact on segment income of $8 million. The above market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, mix and crude costs, as well as the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had estimated negative impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income of $97 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $8 million for the first quarter of 2015. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

The increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs were primarily attributable to significant turnaround costs incurred by the Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to lower energy and employee benefit expenses, partially offset by higher catalyst costs.We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with purchased RINs increased to $63 million in the first quarter of 2016 from $41 million in the first quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, the increase was primarily due to increased costs and quantities purchased of bio-mass based diesel RINs. 44Table of Contents Speedway segment income from operations decreased $1 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in segment income was primarily due to a decrease in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $33 million, or $0.0288 per gallon, and higher operating expenses, partially offset by a $19 million increase in merchandise margins, an increase in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location.The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment.

In the first quarter of 2016, the increase was primarily due to operating results from MarkWest following the MarkWest Merger, which was effective December 4, 2015.Corporate and other unallocated items decreased $12 million in the first quarter of 2016, largely due to a reduction in employee benefit expenses.The first quarter of 2016 includes an impairment charge of $129 million recorded by MPLX to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a discussion of the interim impairment assessment of goodwill.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $308 million at March 31, 2016 compared to $1.13 billion at December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first three months of 2016 and 2015 are presented in the following table.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2016 2015Net cash provided by (used in):   Operating activities$327 $1,190Investing activities(727) (388)Financing activities(419) (218)Total$(819) $584Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $863 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to a decrease in net income of $981 million and an unfavorable change in working capital of $222 million partially offset by an increase in non-cash adjustments of $340 million. The increase in non-cash adjustments is primarily due to an impairment charge of $129 million recorded by MPLX and increased depreciation and amortization expense of $127 million due to the depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in the MarkWest Merger. Changes in working capital were a net $277 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a net $55 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2015. The net $277 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventory. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt. Changes from December 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable decreased $660 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to lower crude oil volumes and prices.•Current receivables decreased $325 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to lower crude oil volumes and prices. 45Table of Contents •Inventories decreased $242 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to decreases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. The net $55 million use of cash from working capital changes in the first quarter of 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventory. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt. Changes from December 31, 2014 to March 31, 2015 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable decreased $1.27 billion from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil prices.•Current receivables decreased $694 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil prices. •Inventories decreased $205 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to decreases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. Net cash used in investing activities was $339 million higher in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to increases in additions to property, plant and equipment and acquisitions and investments in affiliates, partially offset by an increase in disposal of assets.The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows.

Net cash used in equity method investments increased $25 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to contributions to equity affiliates of MPLX of $29 million and Illinois Extension Pipeline of $24 million to fund the SAX pipeline project as compared to our contribution to Illinois Extension Pipeline of $37 million to fund the SAX pipeline project in the first quarter of 2015. Cash from disposal of assets increased primarily due to the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016.Financing activities were a net $419 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a net $218 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2015. The uses of cash in 2016 included long-term debt repayments, dividend payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and common stock repurchases under our share repurchase authorizations offset by sources of cash from the issuance of MPLX common units and long-term debt and commercial paper borrowings.46Table of Contents Long-term debt borrowings and repayments were a net $559 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a net $107 million source of cash in the first quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of 2016, MPLX repaid amounts outstanding under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility. During the first quarter of 2015, MPLX used proceeds from its $500 million of MPLX Senior Notes to repay amounts outstanding under the MPLX Credit Agreement, as well as for general partnership purposes.Cash used in common stock repurchases decreased $134 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases for these periods. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase authorizations.

As of March 31, 2016, we owned a 25 percent interest in MPLX, including a two percent general partner interest, compared to a 71.5 percent interest as of March 31, 2015.Cash used in dividend payments increased $33 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to a $0.07 per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our dividend payments were $0.32 per common share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.25 per common share in the first quarter of 2015.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.Capital ResourcesOur liquidity totaled $3.23 billion at March 31, 2016 consisting of:  March 31, 2016(In millions) Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings AvailableCapacityBank revolving credit facility(a)$2,500 $— $2,500Trade receivables facility(b)426 — 426Total$2,926 $— $2,926Cash and cash equivalents    308Total liquidity    $3,234(a) Excludes MPLX’s $2.0 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had $1.7 billion available as of March 31, 2016.(b) Availability under our $1.0 billion trade receivables facility is a function of eligible trade receivables, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products. As of April 30, 2016, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $574 million.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.On February 26, 2016, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2016, we had $188 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 0.89 percent. On April 27, 2016, MPLX entered into an agreement for the private placement of $1 billion of newly authorized 6.5 percent Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the “Preferred Units”) at a price of $32.50 per unit or approximately 30.8 million units. 47Table of Contents The Preferred Units will be entitled to receive an annual distribution from MPLX, which will initially equal $2.1125 per unit. The Preferred Units are convertible into MPLX common units on a one for one basis after three years, at the purchasers’ option, and after four years at MPLX’s option, subject to certain conditions. Closing of the transaction is scheduled to occur in May 2016. The net proceeds after deducting offering and transaction expenses are expected to be approximately $984 million.The MPC term loan agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”), MPC bank revolving credit facility and MPLX credit agreement, which provides for the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and the MPLX term loan facility (“MPLX Credit Agreement”), contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of March 31, 2016, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.37 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. As of March 31, 2016, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 4.1 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of March 31, 2016, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. CompanyRating AgencyRatingMPCMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook) FitchBBB (stable outlook)MPLXMoody’sBaa3 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB- (stable outlook) FitchBBB- (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.Neither the Term Loan Agreement, MPC bank revolving credit facility, MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the Term Loan Agreement, the MPC bank revolving credit facility and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.48Table of Contents Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 37 percent at March 31, 2016 and 38 percent at December 31, 2015.(In millions)March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Debt due within one year$215 $29Long-term debt11,351 11,896Total debt$11,566 $11,925Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$11,566 $11,925Total equity19,494 19,675Total capital$31,060 $31,600Debt-to-total-capital ratio37% 38%Capital RequirementsOur board approved a 2016 capital spending and investment plan of $4.2 billion towards the end of 2015. In light of current market conditions and revisions to expected completion dates for certain projects, we expect 2016 capital spending and investments to be $3.0 billion, excluding capitalized interest. This reduced forecast for capital spending and investments includes spending on refining, retail marketing and midstream projects as well as amounts designated for corporate projects. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, our capital expenditures and investments were $667 million, excluding capitalized interest. There have been no material changes to our 2016 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.During the second quarter of 2016, we paid BP $200 million for the third year’s contingent earnout. Including this second quarter payment, we have paid BP approximately $569 million in total leaving $131 million remaining under the total cap of $700 million. See Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the first quarter of 2016. At March 31, 2016, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If market conditions were to change and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of March 31, 2016, our equity investment in Centennial was $37 million and we had a $33 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial’s outstanding debt. See Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we made no voluntary contributions to our funded pension plans. We have no required funding for 2016, but may make additional voluntary contributions at our discretion depending on the anticipated funding status and plan asset performance.On April 27, 2016, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.32 per share on common stock. The dividend is payable June 10, 2016, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 18, 2016. During the first three months of 2016, we paid $75 million to acquire 2 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $43.96 per delivered share. Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations. As of March 31, 2016, we had $2.69 billion of remaining share repurchase authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.We may utilize various methods to effect additional share repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future share repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.49Table of Contents The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our capital requirements, including our capital spending and budget plan, the contingent earnout payment to the seller of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment, future contributions to our funded pension plans and share repurchases. Forward-looking statements about our capital requirements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking statements regarding capital requirements include the availability of liquidity business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets, market price of our common stock, prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions, the effects of the lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban, completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the U.S. Midwest, our ability to successfully achieve the strategic and other expected objectives relating to the MarkWest Merger, modifications to MPLX earnings and distribution growth objectives, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Contractual Cash Obligations As of March 31, 2016, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first three months of 2016, our long-term debt commitments decreased $577 million due to repayment of borrowings under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility, partially offset by commercial paper borrowings. Also, during the first three months of 2016, our long-term transportation commitments, beginning in 2018, decreased $432 million due to the suspension of a pipeline project for which the Company had made a commitment under a Transportation Services Agreement. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under U.S. GAAP. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.50Table of Contents On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2020 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards, a majority of which is expected to be spent in the years of 2017 through 2020. There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2016.Critical Accounting EstimatesImpairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method InvestmentsAs of March 31, 2016, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except as noted below. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit. During the first quarter of 2016, MPLX, our consolidated subsidiary, determined that an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was necessary based on consideration of a number of first quarter events and circumstances, including i) continued deterioration of near term commodity prices as well as longer term pricing trends, ii) recent guidance on reductions to forecasted capital spending, the slowing of drilling activity and the resulting reduced production growth forecasts released or communicated by MPLX’s producer customers and iii) increases in the cost of capital. The combination of these factors was considered to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test. Based on the first step of the interim goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value for the three reporting units to which goodwill was assigned in connection with the MarkWest Merger was less than their respective carrying value. In step two of the impairment analysis, the implied fair values of the goodwill were compared to the carrying values within those reporting units. Based on this assessment, it was determined that goodwill was impaired in two of the reporting units. Accordingly, MPLX recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the first quarter of 2016.The fair value of the reporting units for the interim goodwill impairment analysis was determined based on applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the expected future results and discount rates, which ranged from 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.MPLX did not record an impairment charge for one reporting unit assigned goodwill. An increase of 0.50% to the discount rate used to estimate this reporting unit’s fair value would have resulted in an additional goodwill impairment charge of more than $400 million. Other significant assumptions used to estimate this reporting unit’s fair value included estimates of future cash flows. If estimates of future cash flows of this reporting unit were to decline, the overall reporting unit's fair value would decrease, resulting in a potential goodwill impairment charge.Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flows of an asset group. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. In the first quarter of 2016, MPLX also considered whether there was any indication of impairment of long-lived assets and equity method investments recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger and determined that there were none.Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted As discussed in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future.51Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.See Notes 15 and 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of March 31, 2016 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after March 31, 2016 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt, including the portion classified as current and excluding capital leases, as of March 31, 2016 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(In millions) Fair Value as of March 31, 2016(a) Change inFair Value(b) Change in Net Income for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016(c)Long-term debt     Fixed-rate$9,622  $785 n/aVariable-rate1,464 n/a 4(a) Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(b) Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at March 31, 2016.(c) Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2016. At March 31, 2016, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement, the MPLX term loan facility, the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and the commercial paper program. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX term loan facility, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.52Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.53Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions)2016 2015Income from Operations by segment   Refining & Marketing(a)$(62) $1,292Speedway167 168Midstream(a)(b)167 90Items not allocated to segments:    Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(b)(67) (79) Pension settlement expenses(1) (1) Impairments(129) —Income from operations$75 $1,470Capital Expenditures and Investments(c)   Refining & Marketing(a)$243 $223Speedway50 45Midstream(a)350 87Corporate and Other(d)41 29Total$684 $384(a) We revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX; our inland marine business, which was previously included in Refining & Marketing, is now included in Midstream.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.LitigationWe are a party to a number of lawsuits and proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Environmental ProceedingsAs previously disclosed, in August 2012 the Federal District Court in Michigan entered our Flare Consent Decree with the EPA that included a civil penalty of $460,000 and injunctive relief designed to ensure good combustion and flare minimization practices were employed at 22 flares located at six of our refineries. We have since requested an amendment to the Flare Consent Decree to provide an extension of time to install flare gas recovery systems as required under the existing Flare Consent Decree. In the first quarter of 2016, we agreed to a civil penalty of $326,500 in connection with the amendment to the Flare Consent Decree. As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, in January 2016, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("MDEQ") issued an Enforcement Notice to Marathon Petroleum Company LP (“MPC LP”) indicating MDEQ intends to pursue enforcement for two Violation Notices issued to MPC LP in 2015. The Violation Notices both allege exceedances of air emissions limitations at our Detroit refinery. In the first quarter of 2016, we tentatively agreed to a civil penalty of $62,000 in connection with the Enforcement Notice.As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, on July 6, 2015, representatives from the EPA and the United States Department of Justice entered a MarkWest Liberty Midstream pipeline launcher/receiver site utilized for pipeline maintenance operations in Washington County, Pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant issued by a magistrate of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The government has presented MarkWest Liberty Midstream with subpoenas to provide documents related to its pipeline and compressor facilities located in Pennsylvania. MarkWest Liberty Midstream is providing information in response to the subpoenas and related requests for information from the EPA, state and other agencies, and is in discussions with the agencies regarding issues associated with its operations of, and any permit related obligations for, its gathering facilities in the region. Immediately following the July 6, 2015 search, MarkWest Liberty Midstream commenced its own assessment of its operations of launcher/receiver facilities. MarkWest Liberty Midstream’s review to date has determined that MarkWest Liberty Midstream’s operations have been conducted in a manner fully protective of its employees and the public, and that other than potentially having to obtain certain permits at a relatively small number of individual sites, MarkWest Liberty Midstream has operated in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations. It is possible that, in connection with any potential or asserted civil or criminal enforcement action associated with this matter, MarkWest Liberty Midstream will incur material assessments, penalties or fines, incur material defense costs and expenses, be required to modify operations or construction activities which could increase operating costs and capital expenditures, or be subject to other obligations or restrictions that could restrict or prohibit our activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The amount of any potential assessments, penalties, fines, restrictions, requirements, modifications, costs or expenses that may be incurred in connection with any potential enforcement action cannot be reasonably estimated or determined at this time.We are involved in a number of environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 57Table of Contents Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
