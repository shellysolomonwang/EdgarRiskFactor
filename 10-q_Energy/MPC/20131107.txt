Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered.Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer.•Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway business segment and to dealers and jobbers who operate Marathon® retail outlets;•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway® convenience stores; and•Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX and MPC’s retained pipeline assets and investments.Executive SummaryNet income attributable to MPC was $168 million and $1.49 billion, or $0.54 and $4.60 per diluted share, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to $1.22 billion and $2.63 billion, or $3.59 and $7.65 per diluted share, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. The decreases were primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment, which generated income from operations of $227 million and $2.24 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to $1.69 billion and $3.96 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012.The decreases in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations were primarily due to decreases in refining and marketing gross margins, which were $2.55 per barrel and $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to $13.12 per barrel and $10.92 per barrel in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. These impacts were partially offset by increases in refinery throughputs and refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013.Speedway segment income from operations increased $26 million in the third quarter and $59 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin and our merchandise gross margin, partially offset by less income due to the absence of asset sales and higher operating expenses.30Table of ContentsPipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $2 million in the third quarter and $19 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. The increases primarily reflect higher transportation tariffs, partially offset by higher operating and depreciation expenses.On February 1, 2013, we paid $1.49 billion to acquire from BP the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, an allocation of BP’s Colonial Pipeline Company shipper history, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites and a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility, as well as the inventory associated with these assets. We refer to these assets as the “Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets”. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Information for periods prior to the acquisition does not include amounts for these operations. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition.On August 1, 2013, we acquired from Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. its interests in three ethanol companies for $75 million. Under the purchase agreement, we acquired an additional 24 percent interest in TACE, bringing our ownership interest to 60 percent; a 34 percent interest in The Andersons Ethanol Investment LLC, which holds a 50 percent ownership in TAME, bringing our direct and indirect ownership interest in TAME to 67 percent; and a 40 percent interest in TAAE, which owns an ethanol production facility in Albion, Michigan. We hold a noncontrolling interest in each of these entities and account for them using the equity method of accounting since the minority owners have substantive participating rights.On January 30, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The board also extended the remaining $650 million share repurchase authorization for a total outstanding authorization of $2.65 billion through December 2014. On September 26, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization through September 2015. During the first nine months of 2013, the final shares from the $500 million ASR program were delivered to us and we paid $2.34 billion to acquire 30 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $76.01 per delivered share. At September 30, 2013, we also had agreements to repurchase additional common shares for $42 million, which were settled in early October 2013. As of September 30, 2013, we had total outstanding repurchase authorizations pursuant to the authorizations announced on January 30, 2013 and September 26, 2013 of approximately $2.31 billion.Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our refining and marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our refining and marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries, the costs of purchased products and refinery direct operating costs, including turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil (“LLS”) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent sulfur residual fuel) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our refining and marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and marketing gross margin.Historically, West Texas Intermediate crude oil (“WTI”) has traded at prices similar to LLS. During the first nine months of 2012 and in early 2013, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our refining and marketing gross margin. Logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets and other market factors acted to keep the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions. However, the differential between WTI and LLS significantly narrowed in the second and third quarters of 2013 due to a variety of domestic and international market conditions along with changes in logistical infrastructure. Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors.31Table of ContentsThe following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.

Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. We had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Garyville, Louisiana; and Galveston Bay refineries during the first nine months of 2013 compared to activities at our Detroit, Michigan; Garyville; and Robinson, Illinois refineries during the first nine months of 2012.SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile. Approximately two-thirds of Speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013.Pipeline TransportationThe profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. In the fourth quarter of 2012, new transportation services agreements were entered into between MPC and MPLX, which resulted in higher tariff rates. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillates peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.32Table of ContentsResults of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions)2013 2012 Variance 2013 2012 VarianceRevenues and other income:           Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$26,253 $21,047 $5,206 $75,256 $61,551 $13,705Sales to related parties3 2 1 7 6 1Income from equity method investments9 7 2 16 18 (2)Net gain on disposal of assets1 175 (174) 3 178 (175)Other income8 18 (10) 40 28 12Total revenues and other income26,274 21,249 5,025 75,322 61,781 13,541Costs and expenses:           Cost of revenues (excludes items below)23,553 17,202 6,351 65,907 51,323 14,584Purchases from related parties103 84 19 254 204 50Consumer excise taxes1,631 1,463 168 4,685 4,271 414Depreciation and amortization299 246 53 888 712 176Selling, general and administrative expenses305 293 12 912 909 3Other taxes82 66 16 259 204 55Total costs and expenses25,973 19,354 6,619 72,905 57,623 15,282Income from operations301 1,895 (1,594) 2,417 4,158 (1,741)Net interest and other financial income (costs)(47) (25) (22) (140) (64) (76)Income before income taxes254 1,870 (1,616) 2,277 4,094 (1,817)Provision for income taxes81 646 (565) 775 1,460 (685)Net income173 1,224 (1,051) 1,502 2,634 (1,132)Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests5 — 5 16 — 16Net income attributable to MPC$168 $1,224 $(1,056) $1,486 $2,634 $(1,148)Net income attributable to MPC decreased $1.06 billion in the third quarter and $1.15 billion in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to decreases in refining and marketing gross margins, which were $2.55 per barrel and $5.42 per barrel in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to $13.12 per barrel and $10.92 per barrel in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. These impacts were partially offset by increases in refinery throughputs and refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013.Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $5.21 billion in the third quarter and $13.71 billion in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes, which increased to 2,155 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) and 2,063 mbpd in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 from 1,622 mbpd and 1,590 mbpd in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013. This impact was partially offset by decreases in refined product selling prices.Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $174 million in the third quarter and $175 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to the absence of a $171 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets.Other income decreased $10 million in the third quarter and increased $12 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. The decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to the absence of $12 million of dividends received from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our Minnesota Assets in connection with the 33Table of Contentssettlement agreement with the buyer in the third quarter of 2012, partially offset by an increase in dividends received from a pipeline affiliate in third quarter of 2013. The increase in the first nine months was primarily due to increases in sales of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) and dividends received from a pipeline affiliate, partially offset by the absence of $12 million of dividends received from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our Minnesota Assets during the third quarter of 2012. See Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Minnesota Assets sale and subsequent settlement agreement with the buyer.Cost of revenues increased $6.35 billion in the third quarter and $14.58 billion in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. The increases were primarily due to increases in purchased crude oil volumes in the Refining & Marketing segment. Crude oil volumes increased 42 percent in the third quarter and 35 percent in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily associated with the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013. The third quarter of 2013 was also impacted by higher acquisition costs per barrel of crude oil compared to the third quarter of 2012.Purchases from related parties increased $19 million in the third quarter and $50 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to increases in ethanol volumes purchased from our ethanol investments, including purchases from TAAE, which became an equity method affiliate on August 1, 2013. Our acquisition costs of ethanol from our ethanol investments was also impacted by lower ethanol prices in the third quarter of 2013 and higher ethanol prices in the first nine months of 2013. In addition, purchases from Centennial increased during the third quarter but decreased for the first nine months of 2013 compared to 2012.Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that continued through the first nine months of 2013. At September 30, 2013, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial and concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on various potential uses of Centennial’s assets. If current business conditions remain unchanged and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of September 30, 2013, our equity investment in Centennial was $30 million and we had a $43 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial's outstanding debt. See Note 22 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.Consumer excise taxes increased $168 million in the third quarter and $414 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the same periods of 2012, primarily due to increases in refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013.Depreciation and amortization increased $53 million in the third quarter and $176 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan refinery and our acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.Other taxes increased $16 million in the third quarter and $55 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to increases in personal property and payroll taxes. These increases were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery, the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets and Speedway’s acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012. The increase in the third quarter was also partially due to an increase in sales and use tax expense primarily attributable to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.Net interest and other financial costs increased $22 million in the third quarter and $76 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily reflecting decreases in capitalized interest due to the completion of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project in late 2012. We capitalized interest of $7 million in the third quarter and $15 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to $29 million in the third quarter and $95 million in the first nine months of 2012.Provision for income taxes decreased $565 million in the third quarter and $685 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to the $1.62 billion and $1.82 billion decreases in income before income taxes. The effective tax rates were 32 percent and 34 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to 35 percent and 36 percent in the same periods of 2012. The effective tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 is less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. See Note 11 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further details.34Table of ContentsSegment ResultsRevenues are summarized by segment in the following table.

Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 774 million gallons in the third quarter and 2.21 billion gallons in the first nine months of 2013 compared to 714 million gallons in the third quarter and 2.00 billion gallons in the first nine months of 2012, with the increased volumes in the first nine months of 2013 partially due to Speedway’s acquisitions of convenience stores in 2013 and 2012.Speedway segment revenues decreased $32 million in the third quarter and increased $261 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. The $32 million decrease in the third quarter of 2013 was primarily due to a decrease in gasoline and distillate selling prices, partially offset by an increase in gasoline and distillate sales volumes of 24 million gallons. The $261 million increase in the first nine months of 2013 was primarily due to an increase in gasoline and distillate sales volumes of 88 million gallons, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline and distillate selling prices. Gasoline and distillate selling prices averaged $3.47 per gallon and $3.54 per gallon in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 compared to $3.63 per gallon and $3.59 per gallon in the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. The Speedway 35Table of Contentssegment also had higher merchandise sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013. The increases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and merchandise sales in the first nine months of 2013 were primarily due to the acquisitions of convenience stores in 2013 and 2012.Pipeline Transportation segment revenue increased $21 million in the third quarter and $76 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to higher transportation tariffs from our crude oil pipelines, resulting from higher crude oil volumes transported and increased tariff rates in the last half of 2012. Crude oil pipeline throughput volumes increased 181 mbpd in the third quarter and 158 mbpd for the nine months of 2013 compared to the corresponding 2012 periods. Higher average prices received on our refined products pipelines were offset by decreased volumes transported during the third quarter and first nine months of 2013. Refined products pipeline throughput volumes decreased 131 mbpd in the third quarter and 42 mbpd for the nine months of 2013 compared to the corresponding 2012 periods.Income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are presented in the following table.

The main factors contributing to the decreases were narrower crude oil differentials, lower crack spreads and lower product price realizations compared to the spot market product prices used in the LLS crack spread calculation.The sweet and sour crude oil differentials narrowed by $5.67 per barrel in the third quarter and $3.90 per barrel in the first nine months of 2013. In addition, the LLS-WTI crude oil differentials narrowed by $13.05 per barrel in the third quarter and $4.97 per barrel in the first nine months of 2013. The Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread decreased $5.29 per barrel and $0.66 per barrel in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013. These impacts were partially offset by increases in refinery throughputs and refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013.The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

The increases were primarily attributable to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery, which had higher operating costs per barrel of throughput than the average of our other six refineries due to its greater level of complexity.37Table of ContentsWe purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS2”) compliance. Our cost of purchasing RINs increased to $78 million and $185 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2013 from $4 million and $70 million in the same periods of 2012, primarily due to higher ethanol RIN prices. The increase in the third quarter was also partially due to higher biomass-based diesel RIN prices and the increase in the first nine months was also partially due to an increase in the biomass-based diesel volumetric obligation.Speedway segment income from operations increased $26 million in the third quarter and $59 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012, primarily due to increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin and our merchandise gross margin, partially offset by less income due to the absence of operating asset sales and higher operating expenses. The increases in our gasoline and distillate gross margin were primarily due to $0.0304 and $0.0202 increases in our gross margin per gallon along with higher sales volumes. The increases in the merchandise gross margin were primarily due to higher merchandise sales. The increases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes, merchandise sales and expenses in the first nine months of 2013 primarily related to an increase in the number of convenience stores.The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Speedway segment.  Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012Convenience stores at period-end1,471 1,463    Gasoline & distillate sales (millions of gallons)803 779 2,329 2,241Gasoline & distillate gross margin (dollars per gallon)(a)$0.1404 $0.1100 $0.1483 $0.1281Merchandise sales (in millions)$843 $826 $2,360 $2,297Merchandise gross margin (in millions)$224 $217 $620 $599Same store gasoline sales volume (period over period)1.0% (3.9)% 0.6% (1.1)%Same store merchandise sales excluding cigarettes (period over period)5.6% 4.1 % 3.8% 8.0 % (a) The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, divided by gasoline and distillate sales volume.Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $2 million in the third quarter and $19 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. The increases primarily reflect higher transportation tariffs, partially offset by higher operating and depreciation expenses.Corporate and other unallocated expenses decreased $15 million in the third quarter and $55 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2012. The decreases were primarily due to lower unallocated employee benefit and information technology expenses.We recognized a gain of $183 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota Assets, which included $86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed. See Note 6 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Minnesota Assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer.We recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $23 million in the third quarter and $83 million in the first nine months of 2013 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during those periods, compared to $33 million in the third quarter and $116 million in the first nine months of 2012.38Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $2.02 billion at September 30, 2013 compared to $4.86 billion at December 31, 2012. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first nine months of 2013 and 2012 are presented in the following table.  Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions)2013 2012Net cash provided by (used in):   Operating activities$2,050 $2,449Investing activities(2,251) (1,033)Financing activities(2,641) (1,108)Total$(2,842) $308Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $399 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012, primarily due to a decrease in net income, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital compared to 2012. Changes in working capital were a net $330 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2013 compared to a net $1.35 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2012. The $330 million use of cash from working capital changes in the first nine months of 2013 was primarily due to increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes and current receivables, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Changes in inventories were a $1.33 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. Current receivables increased $983 million from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes associated with the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013, and an increase in income taxes receivable associated with federal income taxes. Accounts payable increased $2.18 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes related to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery in February 2013 and higher crude oil prices at the end of the third quarter of 2013 compared to year-end 2012. The $1.35 billion use of cash from working capital changes in the first nine months of 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from a reduction in crude oil payable volumes and an increase in inventories resulting primarily from interim seasonal increases in refined products and crude oil inventory volumes. Partially offsetting these uses of cash was a decrease in accounts receivable primarily caused by lower crude oil receivable volumes, partially offset by higher refined products receivables.Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.22 billion in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012, primarily due to the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets acquisition in February 2013, partially offset by lower capital expenditures in 2013 due to the completion of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project in late 2012.The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows.

See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.(d) Includes capitalized interest of $15 million and $95 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.The acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets comprised 60 percent of our total capital spending in the first nine months of 2013. The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, which we completed in the fourth quarter of 2012, comprised 56 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in the first nine months of 2012.Net cash used in financing activities increased $1.53 billion in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012. The uses of cash for both periods were primarily for common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plans and dividend payments.Cash used in common stock repurchases under the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors increased $1.49 billion in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012. During the first nine months of 2013, we paid $2.34 billion to repurchase 30 million common shares through open market repurchases compared to $850 million paid to repurchase 20 million shares under an ASR program during the nine months of 2012. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.Cash used in dividend payments increased $67 million in the first nine months of 2013 compared to the first nine months of 2012, primarily due to an average 9 cent per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment for the nine months, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our dividend payments totaled $1.12 per common share in the first nine months of 2013 compared to $0.85 per common share in the first nine months of 2012.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.40Table of ContentsCapital ResourcesAs of September 30, 2013, we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreements or our trade receivables securitization facility and our liquidity totaled $5.52 billion consisting of: (In millions)September 30, 2013Cash and cash equivalents$2,018Revolving credit agreement(a)2,500Trade receivables securitization facility1,000Total$5,518 (a) Excludes MPLX’s $500 million revolving credit agreement, which was undrawn as of September 30, 2013.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.Our revolving credit agreement (the “MPC Credit Agreement”) and MPLX’s revolving credit agreement (the “MPLX Credit Agreement”) contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2013, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.18 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPC Credit Agreement.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). As of September 30, 2013, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 0.1 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of September 30, 2013, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. Rating Agency  Rating Moody’s Baa2 (positive outlook)Standard & Poor’s BBB (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.Neither the MPC Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the MPC Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post a letter of credit under an existing transportation services agreement.41Table of ContentsDebt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 23 percent at September 30, 2013 and 22 percent December 31, 2012.

The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, our capital expenditures and investments were $891 million, excluding capitalized interest and the purchase price for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. There have been no material changes to our 2013 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we may be required to pay to the seller a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we made contributions of $158 million to our funded pension plans. We may make additional contributions to our funded pension plans in 2013 depending on the anticipated funding status and plan asset performance.On October 30, 2013, our board of directors approved a 42 cents per share dividend, payable December 10, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 20, 2013.On January 30, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The board also extended the remaining $650 million share repurchase authorization for a total outstanding authorization of $2.65 billion through December 2014. On September 26, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization through September 2015. During the first nine months of 2013, the final shares from the $500 million ASR program were delivered to us and we paid $2.34 billion to acquire 30 million common shares through open market share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2013, we also entered into agreements to acquire additional common shares for $42 million, which were settled in early October 2013. At September 30, 2013, the initial $2.0 billion repurchase authorization announced on February 1, 2012 and extended on January 30, 2013 had been exhausted. As of September 30, 2013, we had total outstanding repurchase authorizations pursuant to the authorizations announced on January 30, 2013 and September 26, 2013 of $2.31 billion, of which $309 million expires in December 2014 and $2.0 billion expires in September 2015.We may utilize various methods to effect additional repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, ASRs or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.The above discussion of the share repurchase authorizations includes forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect the share repurchase plan and its timing include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.42Table of ContentsContractual Cash ObligationsThe following table provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of September 30, 2013.

We are in the process of implementing systems that will allow us to estimate prices based on futures curves, which as of September 30, 2013, has been implemented for contracts with purchase obligations of $2.81 billion.(d) Includes obligations to advance funds to equity method investees.(e) Includes $700 million of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.(f) Primarily includes contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services.(g) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2022. See Note 20 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Although off-balance sheet arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on these arrangements to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, 43Table of Contentsestimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On January 25, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit vacated the 2012 cellulosic biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. In light of this ruling, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is reconsidering and is anticipated to lower the 2011 and has subsequently eliminated the 2012 cellulosic biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. The EPA also has proposed a rule establishing a quality assurance program for RINs purchased to help meet the annual biofuel requirements under the RFS2 program. This rule should be finalized later this year and is aimed at reducing the chances that RINs are fraudulently created or sold.On March 29, 2013, the EPA announced its proposed Tier 3 fuel standards. The proposed Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million beginning in calendar year 2017. MPC and its trade organizations have submitted public comments on the standards and the agency is expected to finalize the Tier 3 fuel standards later this year. Our cost of compliance may be material; however, we will likely not be able to reasonably estimate our compliance costs until we have had time to review the final standards and develop our compliance plans.There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2013.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The following critical accounting estimates have been updated since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 was filed.Fair Value EstimatesAcquisitionsIn accounting for business combinations, acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other assets and liabilities. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance.44Table of ContentsThe fair value of assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity specific differences. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions.DerivativesWe record all derivative instruments at fair value. All of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value.Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedAs of September 30, 2013, there are no accounting standards that have not yet been adopted.45Table of ContentsItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.See Notes 15 and 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the incremental effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of September 30, 2013 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after September 30, 2013 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the projected incremental effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point shift in interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2013 is provided in the following table.

Therefore, the fair value of the portfolio is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.LitigationWe are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Environmental ProceedingsIn May 2013, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality ("MDEQ") issued a Notice of Enforcement to Marathon Petroleum Company LP for alleged violations associated with exceeding various air permit limits. In October 2013, we self-disclosed potential similar exceedences that may occur by the end of 2013. We expect to resolve these violations through revisions in the air permit limits. The resolution of this matter may result in a penalty in excess of $100,000.We are involved in a number of other environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Item 1A.
