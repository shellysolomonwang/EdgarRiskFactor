Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream services company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.8 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Northeast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,730 convenience stores in 21 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,500 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.Through our ownership interests in MPLX and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MarkWest, we believe we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the United States, the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions and we distribute refined products through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets. Our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. Our assets include approximately 7,700 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 500 mbpd of fractionation capacity. We also own more than 5,600 miles of gas gathering and NGL pipelines and have ownership interests in more than 50 gas processing plants, more than 10 NGL fractionation facilities and two condensate stabilization facilities. We own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 10,800 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines, an inland marine business and one of the largest light product terminal operations in the United States to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products from our refineries to wholesale and retail market areas. In the first quarter of 2017, we revised our segment reporting in connection with the contribution of certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX. The operating results for these assets are now reported in our Midstream segment. Previously they were reported as part of our Refining & Marketing segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised presentation. The results for the pipeline and storage assets were recast effective January 1, 2015 and the results for the terminal assets were recast effective April 1, 2016. Prior to these dates these assets were not considered businesses for accounting purposes and therefore there are no financial results from which to recast segment results. Our operations consist of three reportable segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including pipeline and marine transportation, terminal and storage services provided by our Midstream segment. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience merchandise in retail markets in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. 35Table of Contents •Midstream – includes the operations of MPLX and certain other related operations. The Midstream segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs; and transports and stores crude oil and refined products, principally for the Refining & Marketing segment. Strategic Actions to Enhance Shareholder ValueOn January 3, 2017, we announced plans to significantly accelerate the dropdown of assets with an estimated $1.4 billion of MLP-eligible annual EBITDA to MPLX, subject to requisite approvals and regulatory clearances, including tax clearance, and market and other conditions. We expect these dropdowns to be valued consistent with recent industry precedent valuation multiples ranging between 7.0x and 9.0x EBITDA, subject to the MPLX conflicts committee review process and receipt of customary fairness opinions. We also expect MPLX to finance the dropdown transactions in the aggregate with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions. The equity financing is expected to be funded through MPLX common units issued to us. In conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns, we also expect to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of MPLX, including incentive distribution rights, for newly issued MPLX common units. These actions are designed to unlock the value inherent in our midstream platform and to provide the ongoing return of capital to shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. See “MPLX LP - Dropdowns to MPLX” for information on the first of these dropdowns, which was completed on March 1, 2017.Additionally, a special committee of our board of directors, with the assistance of an independent financial advisor, will conduct a full and thorough review of Speedway to ensure optimum value is being delivered to shareholders over the long term. We expect to provide an update on the review by mid-2017. Executive SummaryResultsSelect results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions, except per share data) 2017 2016Refining & Marketing$(70) $(86)Speedway135 167Midstream309 189Items not allocated to segments(82) (195)Income from operations$292 $75Net income attributable to MPC$30 $1Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$0.06 $0.003Net income attributable to MPC was $30 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $1 million, or $0.003 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations improved $16 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $1.78 per barrel increase in the gross margin offset by higher direct operating costs including increased turnaround activity. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from higher crack spreads and favorable changes in volumetric gains, offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared with the spot market reference prices. The Chicago and Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread increased $3.10 per barrel to $7.72 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017 from $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016.Speedway segment income from operations decreased $32 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location in the first quarter 2016 and lower light product and merchandise gross margin, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Speedway's light product margin decreased to 15.66 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2017 from 16.82 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2016. 36Table of Contents Midstream segment income from operations increased $120 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased processing and fractionation activity and the earnings from equity investments in new and existing pipeline and marine operations. Comparability of the Midstream segment's results to the first quarter of 2016 was also affected by the drop of certain terminal assets to MPLX during the quarter. These assets were considered a business effective April 1, 2016. As a result, no financial results are available for the light product terminals business prior to that date and the first quarter of 2016 does not reflect any results for these assets in the Midstream segment. There is an offsetting income from operations impact of the terminals dropdown included in the Refining & Marketing segment.Items not allocated to segments in the first quarter of 2016 reflects a $129 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded by MPLX.MPLX LPAs of March 31, 2017, we owned a 27.8 percent interest in MPLX, including a two percent general partner interest. This ownership percentage assumes the conversion at 1.09 to 1.00 of the MPLX Class B Units in July 2017. On December 4, 2015, MPLX completed the MarkWest Merger. The total value of consideration transferred was $8.61 billion, consisting of $7.33 billion in equity and $1.28 billion in cash. At closing, we made a payment of $1.23 billion to MarkWest common unitholders and the remaining $50 million will be paid in equal amounts, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which will be paid in July 2017, in connection with the conversion of the MPLX Class B Units to MPLX common units. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the MarkWest Merger.Reorganization TransactionsOn September 1, 2016, MPC, MPLX and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify MPLX’s ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting. In connection with these transactions, MPC contributed $225 million to MPLX and all of the issued and outstanding MPLX Class A Units, all of which were held by MarkWest Hydrocarbon, a subsidiary of MPLX, were exchanged for newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in MPLX. The simple average of the NYSE closing price of MPLX common units for the last 10 trading days preceeding September 1, 2016 was used for purposes of these transactions. As a result of these transactions, MPC increased its ownership interest in MPLX by 7 million MPLX common units, or approximately 1 percent. Private Placement of Preferred UnitsOn May 13, 2016, MPLX completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the “MPLX Preferred Units”) for a cash price of $32.50 per unit. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the MPLX Preferred Units was used by MPLX for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes. The MPLX Preferred Units rank senior to all MPLX common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. The holders of the MPLX Preferred Units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to $0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of issuance. Following the second anniversary of the issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units, the holders of the MPLX Preferred Units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common units. The MPLX Preferred Units are convertible into MPLX common units on a one for one basis after three years, at the purchasers’ option, and after four years at MPLX’s option, subject to certain conditions. The MPLX Preferred Units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside our control. Therefore, they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets. We have recorded the MPLX Preferred Units at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs. Since the MPLX Preferred Units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future, adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable that the security would become redeemable.37Table of Contents Dropdowns to MPLXOn March 1, 2017, we contributed certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX in exchange for total consideration of $2.0 billion. This consideration consisted of MPLX equity and $1.5 billion in cash. We received approximately 13 million common units and 264 thousand general partner units from MPLX, which was determined by dividing $504 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for the 10 trading days preceding the closing date, pursuant to the Membership Interests Contributions Agreement. We also agreed to waive two-thirds of the first quarter 2017 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions with respect to the common units issued in the transactions. The contributions of these assets were accounted for as transactions between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss. On March 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to MPLX in exchange for 23 million MPLX common units and 460 thousand general partner units. The number of units we received from MPLX was determined by dividing $600 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for the 10 trading days preceding March 14, 2016, pursuant to the Membership Interests Contribution Agreement. We also agreed to waive first-quarter 2016 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions, with respect to the common units issued in this transaction. The contribution of our inland marine business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss. Public OfferingsOn February 10, 2017, MPLX completed a public offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% unsecured senior notes due March 2027 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.200% unsecured senior notes due March 2047. The net proceeds were used to fund the $1.5 billion cash portion of the consideration MPLX paid MPC for the dropdown of assets on March 1, 2017, as well as for general partnership purposes. See Note 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information.ATM ProgramOn August 4, 2016, MPLX entered into a second amended and restated distribution agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) providing for the continuous issuance of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings under its ATM Program. MPLX expects to use the net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program for general partnership purposes including repayment of debt and funding for acquisitions, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, MPLX issued an aggregate of 4 million common units under the ATM Program, generating net proceeds of approximately $148 million. As of March 31, 2017, $570 million of MPLX common units remains available for issuance through the ATM Program under the Distribution Agreement.Distributions from MPLXThe following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during the first three months of 2017 and 2016.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2017 2016Cash distributions received from MPLX:   General partner distributions, including IDRs$57 $40Limited partner distributions45 29Total$102 $69The market value of the 99.6 million MPLX common units we owned at March 31, 2017 was $3.59 billion based on the March 31, 2017 closing unit price of $36.08. We also believe there is substantial value attributable to our two percent general partnership interest, including the IDRs.On April 26, 2017, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.5400 per common unit payable on May 15, 2017. As a result, MPLX will make distributions totaling $263 million to its limited and general partners. MPC’s portion of these distributions is approximately $114 million. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.38Table of Contents Acquisitions and InvestmentsOn March 1, 2017, MPLX closed on its previously announced transaction with Enbridge Pipelines (Ozark) LLC, under which an affiliate of MPLX has purchased the Ozark pipeline for approximately $220 million. The Ozark pipeline is a 433-mile, 22-inch crude oil pipeline originating in Cushing, Oklahoma, and terminating in Wood River, Illinois, capable of transporting approximately 230 mbpd. On February 15, 2017, MPLX closed on the previously announced transaction to acquire a partial, indirect equity interest in the Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company Pipeline (“ETCOP”) projects, collectively referred to as the Bakken Pipeline system, through a joint venture with Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. (“Enbridge Energy Partners”). The Bakken Pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470 mbpd of crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to the Midwest through Patoka, Illinois and ultimately to the Gulf Coast. MPLX contributed $500 million of the $2 billion purchase price paid by the joint venture to acquire a 36.75 percent indirect equity interest in the Bakken Pipeline system from Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”) and Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. (“SXL”). MPLX holds, through a subsidiary, a 25 percent interest in the joint venture, which equates to an approximate 9.2 percent indirect equity interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. In connection with closing the transaction with ETP and SXL and the previous decision to indefinitely suspend the Sandpiper project, Enbridge Energy Partners canceled MPC’s transportation services agreement with respect to the Sandpiper pipeline and released MPC from paying any termination fee per that agreement.Effective January 1, 2017, MarkWest, and Antero Midstream formed a joint venture, Sherwood Midstream, to support the development of Antero Resources Corporation’s Marcellus Shale acreage in West Virginia. MarkWest has a 50 percent ownership interest in Sherwood Midstream. In connection with this transaction, MarkWest contributed certain gas processing plants currently under construction at the Sherwood Complex with a fair value of approximately $134 million and cash of approximately $20 million. Antero Midstream made an initial capital contribution of approximately $154 million. Also effective January 1, 2017, MarkWest converted all of its ownership interests in Ohio Fractionation, a previously wholly-owned subsidiary, to Class A Interests and amended its LLC Agreement to create Class B-3 Interests, which were sold to Sherwood Midstream for $126 million in cash. The Class B-3 Interests provide Sherwood Midstream with the right to fractionation revenue and the obligation to pay expenses related to 20 mbpd of capacity in the Hopedale 3 fractionator.Effective January 1, 2017, MarkWest and Sherwood Midstream formed a joint venture, Sherwood Midstream Holdings, for the purpose of owning, operating and maintaining all of the shared assets for the benefit of and use in the operation of the gas plants and other assets owned by Sherwood Midstream and the gas plants and de-ethanization facilities owned by MarkWest. MarkWest contributed certain real property, equipment and facilities with a fair value of approximately $209 million to Sherwood Midstream Holdings in exchange for a 79 percent initial ownership interest. Sherwood Midstream contributed cash of approximately $44 million to Sherwood Midstream Holdings in exchange for a 21 percent ownership interest. MarkWest has a 10.5 percent indirect interest in Sherwood Midstream Holdings through its ownership in Sherwood Midstream. The net book value of the contributed assets was approximately $194 million. The contribution was determined to be an in-substance sale of real estate. As such, MarkWest only recognized a gain for the portion attributable to Antero Midstream’s indirect interest of approximately $2 million. We account for the investments in Sherwood Midstream and Sherwood Midstream Holdings as part of our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting and we continue to consolidate Ohio Fractionation.See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the investments in Sherwood Midstream, Ohio Fractionation and Sherwood Midstream Holdings. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Speedway and Pilot Flying J finalized the formation of a joint venture consisting of 123 travel plazas, primarily in the Southeast United States. The new entity, PFJ Southeast, consisted of 41 existing locations contributed by Speedway and 82 locations contributed by Pilot Flying J, all of which carry either the Pilot or Flying J brand and are operated by Pilot Flying J. Our non-cash contribution was $273 million based on the book value of the assets we contributed to the joint venture.We currently have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures with Crowley, which were established to own and operate Jones Act vessels in petroleum product service.In September 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture, Crowley Ocean Partners, with Crowley. The joint venture owns and operates four new Jones Act product tankers, three of which are leased to MPC. Two of the vessels were delivered in 2015 and the remaining two were delivered in 2016. We have contributed a total of $141 million for the four vessels.39Table of Contents In May 2016, MPC and Crowley formed a new ocean vessel joint venture, Crowley Coastal Partners, in which MPC has a 50 percent ownership interest. MPC and Crowley each contributed their 50 percent ownership in Crowley Ocean Partners, discussed above, into Crowley Coastal Partners. In addition, we contributed $48 million in cash and Crowley contributed its 100 percent ownership interest in Crowley Blue Water Partners to Crowley Coastal Partners. Crowley Blue Water Partners is an entity that owns and operates three 750 Series ATB vessels that are leased to MPC. We account for our 50 percent interest in Crowley Coastal Partners as part of our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting.See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on Crowley Coastal Partners as a VIE and Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of Crowley Ocean Partners and Crowley Blue Water Partners.On December 4, 2015, MPLX merged with MarkWest, whereby MarkWest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX. Each common unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the MarkWest Merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of MPLX representing limited partner interests in MPLX, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 per unit. Each Class B unit of MarkWest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one Class B unit of MPLX having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations that the Class B units of MarkWest had immediately prior to the merger. At closing, we contributed $1.23 billion in cash to MPLX to pay the cash consideration to MarkWest common unitholders. We will contribute an additional total of $50 million in cash to MPLX for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the MPLX Class B Units to MPLX common units in equal installments, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which will be paid in July 2017. Share Repurchases Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.86 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.14 billion available for repurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we acquired 9 million common shares at an average cost per share of $50.15 under these authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.LiquidityAs of March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.90 billion, excluding MPLX's cash and cash equivalents of $265 million, unused $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facilities and full availability under our $750 million trade receivables facility based on eligible trade receivables. As of March 31, 2017, we do not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. MPLX had no borrowings and $3 million letters of credit outstanding under its $2.0 billion bank revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2017. The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the announced strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value, the ATM Program and our share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect our strategic initiatives include, but are not limited to, the time, costs and ability to obtain regulatory or other approvals and consents and otherwise consummate the strategic initiatives; the satisfaction or waiver of conditions in the agreements governing the strategic initiatives; our ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic initiatives; the impact of adverse market conditions affecting MPC’s and MPLX’s midstream businesses; adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters; inability to agree with the MPLX conflicts committee with respect to the timing of and value attributed to assets expected to be offered to MPLX. Factors that could affect the ATM program and the timing of any issuances under the ATM Program include, but are not limited to, market conditions, availability of liquidity and the market prices of MPLX common units. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. 40Table of Contents Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ULSD and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax)  LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)$450Sweet/sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)225LLS-WTI differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)80Natural gas price sensitivity(d) (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change)130(a) Weighted 40 percent Chicago and 60 percent USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.(b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].(c) Assumes 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.(d) This is consumption based exposure for our Refining & Marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our Midstream segment.In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as: •the selling prices realized for refined products;•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;•our refinery yields;•the cost of products purchased for resale; •the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; and•the potential impact of LCM adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices.Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Costs for planned turnaround, major maintenance and engineering projects are expensed in the period incurred. We had significantly more planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Texas City and Garyville refineries, partially offset by lower planned turnaround and major maintenance at our Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries, during the first three months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. 41Table of Contents SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, transportation fuel prices, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway’s gross margin. Speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.MidstreamNGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. The profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.42Table of Contents Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions) 2017 2016 VarianceRevenues and other income:     Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$16,288 $12,755 $3,533Income from equity method investments57 22 35Net gain on disposal of assets5 25 (20)Other income43 28 15Total revenues and other income16,393 12,830 3,563Costs and expenses:     Cost of revenues (excludes items below)13,133 9,701 3,432Purchases from related parties122 107 15Inventory market valuation adjustment— 15 (15)Consumer excise taxes1,813 1,826 (13)Impairment expense— 129 (129)Depreciation and amortization536 490 46Selling, general and administrative expenses389 378 11Other taxes108 109 (1)Total costs and expenses16,101 12,755 3,346Income from operations292 75 217Net interest and other financial income (costs)(150) (142) (8)Income (loss) before income taxes142 (67) 209Provision for income taxes41 11 30Net income (loss)101 (78) 179Less net income (loss) attributable to:     Redeemable noncontrolling interest16 — 16Noncontrolling interests55 (79) 134Net income attributable to MPC$30 $1 $29Net income attributable to MPC increased $29 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 as increases in income from operations for our Midstream and Refining & Marketing segments were partially offset by a decrease in our Speedway segment income from operations. See Segment Results for additional information.Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $3.53 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices, which increased $0.45 per gallon, partially offset by a decrease in refined product sales volumes. Income from equity method investments increased $35 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily due to increases in income from new and existing pipeline, retail and marine affiliates.Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $20 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016.Other income increased $15 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to increases in sales of excess sulfur credits, RIN sales and operating fees.43Table of Contents Cost of revenues increased $3.43 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to:•an increase in refined product cost of sales of $3.38 billion primarily due to an increase in raw material costs; and•an increase in refinery direct operating costs of $144 million, or $1.34 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to increases in planned turnaround and major maintenance activity and other manufacturing costs in 2017. Purchases from related parties increased $15 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to:•an increase in transportation services provided by Crowley Blue Water Partners, which is a new marine joint venture established in May 2016, of $14 million; •an increase in transportation services provided by Crowley Ocean Partners of $13 million;•a decrease in transportation services provided by pipeline affiliates of $7 million; and•a decrease in volumes of ethanol purchased from TAME, TACE and TAAE of $5 million.Inventory market valuation adjustment increased costs and expenses by $15 million for the first quarter of 2016. There was no such effect in the first quarter of 2017.Consumer excise taxes decreased $13 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to decreases in taxable refined product sales volumes.Impairment expense reflects a $129 million impairment charge recorded by MPLX in the first quarter of 2016.Depreciation and amortization increased $46 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to accelerated depreciation as a result of the decommissioning of an MPLX gas processing facility in conjunction with an expansion project at the Houston Complex.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $11 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to increases in certain first quarter employee benefit expenses.Other taxes were consistent in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016.Net interest and other financial costs increased $8 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the MPLX senior notes issued in February 2017, partially offset by decreased borrowings on the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and the MPC term loan agreement.Provision for income taxes increased $30 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes of $209 million in the first quarter of 2017. The combined federal, state and foreign income tax rate was 29 percent and (17) percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent tax differences related to equity compensation, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and the domestic manufacturing deduction, offset by state and local tax expense. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was significantly affected by permanent tax differences related to the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, including their proportional share of the goodwill impairment charge recorded by MPLX. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest reduced the effective rate for the first three months ended March 31, 2016 by 51 percent from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. 44Table of Contents Segment ResultsRevenuesRevenues, including intersegment sales, are summarized by segment in the following table.

The increase was primarily due to higher refined product sales prices partially offset by lower volumes. The lower sales volumes to Speedway were mainly due to Speedway’s contribution of 41 travel centers to a new joint venture, PFJ Southeast, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The refined product sales to PFJ Southeast continue to be reported in the Refining & Marketing segment totals above, but are no longer considered sales to the Speedway segment. The table below shows our Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment. Three Months Ended  March 31, 2017 2016Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to Speedway:   Intersegment sales (in millions)$2,590 $2,165Refined product sales volumes (millions of gallons)1,336 1,448Average refined product sales prices (dollars per gallon)$1.93 $1.49Speedway segment revenues increased $433 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to an increase in gasoline and distillate sales of $453 million for the first quarter, partially offset by a decrease in merchandise sales of $25 million. The increase in gasoline and distillate sales was primarily due to an increase in average gasoline and distillate selling prices of $0.44 per gallon, partially offset by a volume decrease of 90 million gallons. The decrease in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and merchandise sales is primarily attributable to the contribution of 41 travel centers to PFJ Southeast in the fourth quarter of 2016. Speedway’s share of the results from PFJ Southeast are reported as income from equity method investments.The following table includes certain revenue statistics for the Speedway segment.

The increase was primarily due to higher natural gas and NGL prices and increased processing and fractionation volumes. The comparison also reflects the absence of any revenues for the terminal services provided to the Refining & Marketing segment in the first quarter of 2016 versus the inclusion of revenues for these services in the first quarter of 2017. These assets were not considered a business prior to April, 1, 2016 and therefore, no financial results for these assets were available from which to recast first quarter 2016 Midstream segment results.46Table of Contents The following table includes operating statistics for the Midstream segment.

Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations improved $16 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $1.78 per barrel increase in the gross margin offset by higher direct operating costs including increased turnaround activity. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from higher crack spreads and favorable changes in volumetric gains, offset by less favorable product price realizations as compared with the spot market reference prices. The Chicago and Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread increased $3.10 per barrel to $7.72 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017 from $4.62 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016.47Table of Contents The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment’s business.

Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including the effects of product price realizations, the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had an estimated negative impact on Refining & Marketing segment income of $230 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

Comparable prior period information for gross margin has been recast in connection with the contribution of certain pipeline assets to MPLX on March 1, 2017.(c) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs.(d) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs.Refinery direct operating costs increased $1.34 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to increases in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of $0.67 per barrel and other manufacturing costs of $0.58 per barrel. The increase in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs was primarily attributable to higher turnaround costs incurred by the Texas City and Garyville refineries, partially offset by a decrease in turnaround costs incurred by the Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries in the first quarter of 2017. Other manufacturing costs increased mainly due to higher energy, catalyst and routine maintenance expenses.We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with RINs increased to $97 million in the first quarter of 2017 from $63 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase for the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the effect of increased purchases and prices for bio-mass based diesel RINs and increased RIN obligation requirements published by the EPA.Speedway segment income from operations decreased $32 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of a $24 million gain from the sale of retail location in the first quarter of 2016 and lower light product and merchandise gross margin, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Speedway's light product margin decreased to 15.66 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2017 from 16.82 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2016. The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment.

Midstream segment income from operations increased $120 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased processing and fractionation activity and the earnings from equity investments in new and existing pipeline and marine operations. Comparability of the Midstream segment's results to the first quarter of 2016 was also affected by the drop of certain terminal assets to MPLX during the quarter. These assets were considered a business effective April 1, 2016. As a result, no financial results are available for the light product terminals business prior to that date and the first quarter of 2016 does not reflect any results for these assets in the Midstream segment.Corporate and other unallocated items increased $17 million in the first quarter of 2017, largely due to an increase in certain first-quarter employee benefit expenses along with less corporate costs allocated to the segments.49Table of Contents Items not allocated to segments in the first quarter of 2016 also reflects a $129 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded by MPLX.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $2.17 billion at March 31, 2017 compared to $887 million at December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first three months of 2017 and 2016 are presented in the following table.

Changes in working capital, excluding changes in short-term debt, were a net $410 million source of cash in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a net $277 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2016. The changes in working capital for the first quarter of 2017 were primarily due to decreases in current receivables and inventories partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Changes from December 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Current receivables decreased $333 million from year-end 2016, primarily due to lower refined product volumes, partially offset by higher prices.•Inventories decreased $264 million from year-end 2016, primarily due to decreases in refined product, material and supplies, and crude oil inventories. •Accounts payable decreased $250 million from year-end 2016, primarily due to the timing of costs incurred for certain major maintenance activity and capital projects, partially offset by increases in crude purchase prices and volumes.The net $277 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventory. Changes from December 31, 2015 to March 31, 2016 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable decreased $660 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to lower crude oil volumes and prices.•Current receivables decreased $325 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to lower crude oil volumes and prices. •Inventories decreased $242 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to decreases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. Net cash used in investing activities was $629 million higher in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to investments and acquisitions made during the quarter which are described further below. 50Table of Contents The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash.

(b) Includes capitalized interest of $12 million and $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Net cash contributed to equity method investments increased $485 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to MPLX’s investment of $500 million for a partial interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. Net cash used for acquisitions increased due to MPLX’s acquisition of the Ozark pipeline for $220 million. Net cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment decreased $135 million primarily due to decreased capital expenditures in all segments. Cash from disposal of assets decreased $75 million primarily due to the absence of a first quarter 2016 sale of a Speedway retail location.Financing activities were a net $1.52 billion source of cash in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a net $422 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2016. In 2017, sources of cash from financing activities included long-term debt borrowings, proceeds from issuances of MPLX common units and contributions from noncontrolling interests which were partially offset by uses of cash in financing activities which included common stock repurchases, long-term debt repayments, dividend payments and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Long-term debt borrowings and repayments, including debt issuance costs, were a net $2.01 billion source of cash in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a net $560 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, MPLX issued $2.25 billion of senior notes and we repaid the remaining $200 million balance under the MPC term loan agreement. During the first quarter of 2016, MPLX repaid amounts outstanding under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility.51Table of Contents Cash used in common stock repurchases increased $345 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 as cash proceeds from the dropdown of certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX on March 1, 2017 supported share repurchases of $420 million in March of 2017. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases for these periods. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase authorizations.  Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions, except per share data) 2017 2016Number of shares repurchased9 2Cash paid for shares repurchased$420 $75Effective average cost per delivered share$50.15 $43.96Cash used in dividend payments increased $21 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to a $0.04 per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our dividend payments were $0.36 per common share in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.32 per common share in the first quarter of 2016.Cash used in distributions to noncontrolling interests increased $37 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The distributions increased primarily due to an increase in total MPLX common units outstanding and distributions paid on the MPLX Preferred Units. Cash provided by contributions from noncontrolling interests increased $124 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to MarkWest’s sale of a noncontrolling interest in Ohio Fractionation to Sherwood Midstream.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3.

As discussed in the “Strategic Actions to Enhance Shareholder Value” section in the Corporate Overview, we expect MPLX to finance the planned dropdown transactions in the aggregate with debt and equity in approximately equal proportions. The equity financing will be funded through MPLX common units issued to us. In conjunction with the completion of the dropdowns, we also expect to exchange our economic interests in the general partner of MPLX, including incentive distribution rights, for newly issued MPLX common units. Cash proceeds from the dropdowns and ongoing MPLX common unit distributions to us are expected to fund the substantial ongoing return of capital to MPC shareholders in a manner consistent with maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.52Table of Contents On February 10, 2017, MPLX completed a public offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% unsecured senior notes due March 2027 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.200% unsecured senior notes due March 2047. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1st and September 1st of each year, commencing on September 1, 2017.We may, from time to time, repurchase notes in the open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.We established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2017, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. The MPC bank revolving credit facility and MPLX credit agreement, which provides for the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and the MPLX term loan facility (“MPLX Credit Agreement”), contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC bank revolving credit facility) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of March 31, 2017, we were in compliance with this financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.26 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPC bank revolving credit facility.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. As of March 31, 2017, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.87 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.Our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. As of March 31, 2017, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. CompanyRating AgencyRatingMPCMoody’sBaa2 (negative outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook) FitchBBB (negative watch)MPLXMoody’sBaa3 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB- (stable outlook) FitchBBB- (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.Neither the MPC bank revolving credit facility, MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the MPC bank revolving credit facility, MPLX Credit Agreement, our trade receivables facility and debt held by our ocean vessel joint venture with Crowley. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis or result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.53Table of Contents Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 38 percent at March 31, 2017 and 33 percent at December 31, 2016.(In millions)March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016Debt due within one year$28 $28Long-term debt12,570 10,544Total debt$12,598 $10,572Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$12,598 $10,572Redeemable noncontrolling interest1,000 1,000Total equity19,797 20,203Total capital$33,395 $31,775Debt-to-total-capital ratio38% 33% Capital RequirementsOur board originally approved a 2017 capital spending and investment plan of $1.7 billion for MPC, excluding MPLX. This budget includes spending on refining and marketing, retail and non-MPLX midstream projects as well as amounts designated for corporate projects. The remaining midstream projects are included in the MPLX budget. During the first quarter of 2017, MPLX updated its capital investment plan for organic growth capital to a range of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion, up from $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. The increase includes capital to support the development of the Argo I plant in the Delaware Basin, the Sherwood Complex in the Northeast and an expansion of the Ozark pipeline. MPLX maintenance capital is forecast to be approximately $150 million, an increase of $50 million versus previous guidance, primarily due to expenditures related to assets MPLX acquired during the quarter. Approximately $100 million of this increase will result in a corresponding reduction to MPC’s capital spending forecast as the spending relates to the assets that were contributed to MPLX on March 1, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, our capital expenditures and investments totaled $593 million, excluding MPLX’s acquisitions of a partial interest in the Bakken Pipeline system for $500 million and the Ozark pipeline for approximately $220 million and capitalized interest. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.During the second quarter of 2017, we paid BP $131 million for the fourth year’s contingent earnout related to our 2013 acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery. This second quarter payment represents the final payment under the agreement. See Note 14 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the first quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2017, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If market conditions were to change and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of March 31, 2017, our equity investment in Centennial was $34 million and we had a $24 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial’s outstanding debt. See Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we made no voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan. We have no required funding for 2017, but may make additional voluntary contributions for future years at our discretion depending on the funding status and the plan asset performance. On April 26, 2017, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.36 per share on common stock. The dividend is payable June 12, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 17, 2017. During March of 2017, we paid $420 million to acquire 9 million common shares through open market share repurchases at an effective average cost of $50.15 per delivered share. These share repurchases were supported by cash proceeds from the dropdown of certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX on March 1, 2017. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.54Table of Contents We may utilize various methods to effect additional share repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future share repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.Contractual Cash Obligations As of March 31, 2017, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first three months of 2017, our long-term debt commitments increased $3.95 billion due to the public offering of the MPLX senior notes in February 2017, partially offset by repayment of $200 million of outstanding borrowings under the MPC term loan agreement.Our transportation services agreement for the Sandpiper pipeline was terminated in February 2017. As a result, we had a decrease in our long-term transportation commitments of $2.15 billion. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under U.S. GAAP. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 21 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital requirements, including our capital budget and investment spending, costs for projects under construction, project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth, upgrades and expansion, the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment, future contributions to our funded pension plans and share repurchases. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking statements regarding capital requirements include: the availability of liquidity; business conditions; a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets; our ability to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to the strategic initiatives discussed herein; adverse changes in laws including with respect to tax and regulatory matters; inability to agree with the MPLX conflicts committee with respect to the timing of and value attributed to assets identified for dropdown; changes to the expected construction costs and timing of projects; delays in obtaining third-party approvals; changes in labor, materials and equipment costs and availability; planned and unplanned outages; the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects; project cost overruns; disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor or unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response; continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions; the availability and pricing of crude oil and other feedstocks; slower growth in domestic and Canadian crude supply; completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the U.S. Midwest; consumer demand for refined products; transportation logistics; the reliability of processing units and other equipment; MPC's ability to successfully implement growth opportunities, modifications to MPLX earnings and distribution growth objectives; compliance with federal and state environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations, including the cost of compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard, and/or enforcement actions initiated thereunder; changes to MPC's capital budget; other risk factors inherent to MPC's industry. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. For additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.55Table of Contents Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $650 million between 2014 and 2019 to comply with these standards, which includes estimated capital expenditures of approximately $200 million in 2017.There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2017.Critical Accounting EstimatesThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted As discussed in Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future.56Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.See Notes 14 and 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of March 31, 2017 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after March 31, 2017 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt, including the portion classified as current and excluding capital leases, as of March 31, 2017 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(In millions) Fair Value as of March 31, 2017(a) Change inFair Value(b) Change in Net Income for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017(c)Long-term debt     Fixed-rate$12,863  $1,118 n/aVariable-rate250 n/a 1(a) Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(b) Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at March 31, 2017.(c) Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2017, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the MPLX term loan facility. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the MPLX term loan facility, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.57Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2017, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.58Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  March 31,(In millions)2017 2016Income from Operations by segment   Refining & Marketing(a)$(70) $(86)Speedway135 167Midstream(a)(b)309 189Items not allocated to segments:    Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(b)(82) (65) Pension settlement expenses— (1) Impairments(c)— (129)Income from operations$292 $75Capital Expenditures and Investments(d)   Refining & Marketing$192 $243Speedway35 50Midstream(e)1,070 350Corporate and Other(f)28 41Total$1,325 $684(a) We revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2017 in connection with the contribution of certain terminal, pipeline and storage assets to MPLX.

Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised presentation. The results for the pipeline and storage assets were recast effective January 1, 2015 and the results for the terminal assets were recast effective April 1, 2016. Prior to these dates these assets were not considered businesses and therefore there are no financial results from which to recast segment results.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings, other than items arising in the ordinary course of business, previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.LitigationWe are a co-defendant in four lawsuits consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation pending in the 56th District Court, Galveston County, Texas. Plaintiffs allege personal injuries from a fire that occurred at our Galveston Bay refinery on January 11, 2016. Discovery has commenced in the matters and trial is scheduled for the first case on September 11, 2017. The remaining three cases are scheduled for trials commencing October 10, 2017, October 30, 2017 and December 4, 2017, respectively. At this time, the ultimate outcome of this litigation and liability remains uncertain and we are unable to provide a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of loss, if any, given that the litigation is in a preliminary stage. If these lawsuits are resolved unfavorably in their entirety, it could materially impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, management does not believe the ultimate resolution of this litigation will have a material adverse effect.Environmental ProceedingsAs previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, on February 17, 2016, MarkWest Liberty Bluestone, L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX (“MarkWest Liberty Bluestone”), received an initial Consent Agreement and Final Order (“Initial CAFO”) from the EPA alleging violations of the Clean Air Act resulting from an EPA compliance inspection conducted in July 2012 at our Sarsen Facility, a gas processing facility at our Keystone Complex located in Pennsylvania. The alleged violations included the failure to comply with monitoring, tagging, recordkeeping and repair requirements with respect to certain pumps and/or valves at the facility and with certain emissions reduction and permit application requirements. The Initial CAFO set forth a proposed penalty of $285,000. After subsequent negotiations, MarkWest Liberty Bluestone and the EPA entered into a Consent Agreement and Final Order effective March 28, 2017 resolving these issues, pursuant to which MarkWest Liberty Bluestone will pay a penalty of $95,000 and implement certain enhancements in connection with its existing leak monitoring program.62Table of Contents Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A.
