Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail marketing and pipeline transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,740 convenience stores in 22 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,400 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.•Speedway—with the acquisition of Hess' retail operations effective September 30, 2014, sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information.•Pipeline Transportation—transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX and MPC’s retained pipeline assets and investments.29Table of Contents Executive SummaryResultsSelect results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions, except per share data) 2014 2013 2014 2013Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing$971 $227 $2,593 $2,235Speedway119 102 271 292Pipeline Transportation69 54 222 163Net income attributable to MPC$672 $168 $1,726 $1,486Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$2.36 $0.54 $5.95 $4.60Net income attributable to MPC increased $504 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, in the third quarter and $240 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $744 million in the third quarter and $358 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher U.S. Gulf Coast (“USGC”) and Chicago crack spreads, partially offset by increases in refinery direct operating costs in both periods of 2014 and narrower Light Louisiana Sweet ("LLS") - West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") and sweet/sour differentials in the first nine months of 2014.Speedway segment income from operations increased $17 million in the third quarter and decreased $21 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The increase in segment income for the third quarter was primarily due to increases in our gasoline, distillate and merchandise gross margins, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The decrease in segment income for the first nine months was primarily due to higher operating expenses and a decrease in our gasoline and distillate gross margin, partially offset by an increase in our merchandise gross margin. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $15 million in the third quarter and $59 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to higher pipeline transportation revenue and income from our pipeline affiliates, partially offset by increases in operating expenses primarily attributable to the proposed Cornerstone pipeline project for both periods of 2014 and pipeline maintenance in the third quarter of 2014.MPLX LPWe own a 73.6 percent interest in MPLX, including the two percent general partner interest. Effective March 1, 2014, we sold MPLX a 13 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings for $310 million, increasing MPLX's ownership interest in Pipe Line Holdings to 69 percent. MPLX financed this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and $270 million of borrowings on its bank revolving credit agreement. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.The following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during the first nine months of 2014 and 2013.  Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions) 2014 2013Cash distributions received from MPLX:   General partner distributions, including incentive distribution rights$3 $1Limited partner distributions53 40Total$56 $41The market value of the 17,056,515 MPLX common units and 36,951,515 MPLX subordinated units we owned at September 30, 2014 was $3.18 billion based on the September 30, 2014 closing unit price of $58.94. Over time, we also believe there will be substantial value attributable to our general partnership interests.30Table of Contents Acquisitions and InvestmentsOn September 30, 2014, we acquired from Hess all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40,000 barrels per day on Colonial Pipeline for $2.82 billion. We refer to these assets as “Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets” and substantially all of these assets are part of our Speedway segment. This acquisition significantly expands our Speedway presence from nine to 22 states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow higher-valued, stable cash flow businesses. This acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for an incremental 200,000 barrels per day of assured sales from our refining system. The transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on this acquisition.On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites, a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 thousand barrel per day ("mbpd") allocation of space on the Colonial Pipeline. We refer to these assets as the “Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.” We paid $1.49 billion for these assets, which included $935 million for inventory. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In July 2014, we paid BP $180 million for the first period's contingent earnout. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Our financial results and operating statistics for the periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. In July 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.'s SAX pipeline through our investment in Illinois Extension Pipeline. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we made contributions of $97 million to Illinois Extension Pipeline to fund our portion of the construction costs incurred-to-date on the SAX project. In March 2014, we acquired from Chevron Raven Ridge Pipe Line Company an additional seven percent interest in Explorer for $77 million, bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent. Due to this increase in our ownership percentage, we now account for our investment in Explorer using the equity method of accounting and report Explorer as a related party. Explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Hammond, Indiana.In 2013, we agreed with Enbridge Energy Partners to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline, which will run from Beaver Lodge, North Dakota to Superior, Wisconsin. We also agreed to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project, which is currently estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. We made contributions of $149 million during the first nine months of 2014 and have contributed $173 million since project inception. In exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge Energy Partners' North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service. Enbridge Energy Partners' North Dakota System currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long. We will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions and investments. See Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information regarding our future contributions to the SAX pipeline project and the Sandpiper pipeline project.Share RepurchasesOn July 30, 2014, our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization expiring in July 2016. During the first nine months of 2014, we paid $1.45 billion to acquire 17 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $87.25 per delivered share. At September 30, 2014, we also had agreements to repurchase additional common shares for $9 million, which were settled in early October 2014. As of September 30, 2014, we had $2.41 billion of remaining repurchase authorization. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.31Table of Contents The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the estimated construction costs and completion of the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects and the share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the estimated construction costs, timing and completion of the Sandpiper and SAX pipeline projects, include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Overview of SegmentsRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs.Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.The price of refined products has historically been set by reference to international Brent crude oil prices. In recent years, due to the growth in U.S. crude oil production, logistical constraints and other market factors the spread between Brent and LLS widened, which favorably impacted the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. Recently, the Brent to LLS spread has narrowed significantly. To the extent there is a change in existing U.S. energy policy regarding crude oil exports, the spread between Brent and LLS could remain narrow. If this were to occur, it could reduce the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Historically, WTI has traded at prices similar to LLS. During 2011 and continuing through the first half of 2013, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our Refining & Marketing gross margin. Logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets and other market factors acted to keep the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions. However, due to a variety of domestic and international market conditions including the growth in pipeline capacity from Cushing, Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast region, the differential between WTI and LLS significantly narrowed during the second half of 2013 with a further narrowing broadly continuing through the first nine months of 2014. Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U. S. energy policy.The following table provides sensitivities showing the estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions.(In millions, after-tax)  LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)$450Sweet/sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)200LLS-WTI differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)85Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change)125(a)Weighted 38 percent Chicago and 62 percent USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.(b)LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].(c)Assumes 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.32Table of Contents In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;•our refinery yields;•the selling prices realized for refined products;•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; and•the cost of products purchased for resale.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. We had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Galveston Bay, Texas; Garyville, Louisiana and Robinson, Illinois refineries during the first nine months of 2014 compared to activities at our Catlettsburg, Garyville and Galveston Bay refineries during the first nine months of 2013.SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway's gross margin. Approximately two-thirds of Speedway’s gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014. Speedway's convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.Pipeline TransportationThe profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.33Table of Contents Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions) 2014 2013 Variance 2014 2013 VarianceRevenues and other income:           Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$25,438 $26,256 $(818) $75,567 $75,263 $304Income from equity method investments29 9 20 121 16 105Net gain on disposal of assets2 1 1 14 3 11Other income12 8 4 57 40 17Total revenues and other income25,481 26,274 (793) 75,759 75,322 437Costs and expenses:           Cost of revenues (excludes items below)21,935 23,553 (1,618) 65,571 65,907 (336)Purchases from related parties112 103 9 401 254 147Consumer excise taxes1,622 1,631 (9) 4,736 4,685 51Depreciation and amortization322 299 23 967 888 79Selling, general and administrative expenses342 305 37 1,004 912 92Other taxes86 82 4 288 259 29Total costs and expenses24,419 25,973 (1,554) 72,967 72,905 62Income from operations1,062 301 761 2,792 2,417 375Net interest and other financial income (costs)(50) (47) (3) (144) (140) (4)Income before income taxes1,012 254 758 2,648 2,277 371Provision for income taxes333 81 252 898 775 123Net income679 173 506 1,750 1,502 248Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests7 5 2 24 16 8Net income attributable to MPC$672 $168 $504 $1,726 $1,486 $240Net income attributable to MPC increased $504 million in the third quarter and $240 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations, which increased $744 million in the third quarter and $358 million in the first nine months of 2014. The increases in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations were primarily due to more favorable net product price realizations and higher USGC and Chicago crack spreads, partially offset by increases in refinery direct operating costs in both periods of 2014 and narrower LLS-WTI and sweet/sour differentials in the first nine months of 2014. Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $818 million in the third quarter and increased $304 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The decrease in the third quarter was primarily due to lower refined product and crude oil sales prices and a decrease in refined product sales volumes. The increase in the first nine months was primarily due to an increase in refined product sales volumes, partially offset by lower refined product sales prices.Income from equity method investments increased $20 million in the third quarter and $105 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to increases in income from our ethanol affiliates of $10 million and $70 million, respectively, and increases in income from our pipeline affiliates of $12 million and $36 million, respectively. The increases in income from our ethanol affiliates includes the affects of our acquisition of interests in TAAE, TACE and TAEI in August 2013. The higher income from our pipeline affiliates is primarily due to increases from LOOP and Explorer, which is now accounted for as an equity method investment following our acquisition of an increased ownership interest in this pipeline company. 34Table of Contents Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the first nine months of 2014. At September 30, 2014, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If current business conditions remain unchanged and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of September 30, 2014, our equity investment in Centennial was $35 million and we had a $39 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial's outstanding debt. See Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.Net gain on disposal of assets increased $11 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to the sale of two terminals.Other income increased $17 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to higher gains on sales of excess Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) of $33 million, partially offset by an $11 million impairment in 2014 of an investment in a company accounted for using the cost method. Cost of revenues decreased $1.62 billion in the third quarter and $336 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The decreases were primarily due to:•decreases in refined product cost of sales of $1.68 billion for the third quarter and $1.29 billion for the first nine months, primarily due to a decrease in raw material costs, partially offset in the first nine months by an increase in refined product sales volumes; and•increases in refinery direct operating costs, including costs associated with significant planned turnaround activity, of $152 million, or $0.87 per barrel of total refinery throughput, for the third quarter and $923 million, or $1.95 per barrel of total refinery throughput, for the first nine months.Purchases from related parties increased $9 million in the third quarter and $147 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to:•acquisitions of ownership interests in TAAE in August 2013 and Explorer in March 2014, resulting in purchases from these companies totaling $29 million and $93 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2014, respectively, being reported as purchases from related parties while purchases from these companies prior to these acquisitions were reported as cost of revenues;•an increase in purchases from LOOP of $45 million in the first nine months of 2014; and •an increase in purchases from TAME of $13 million in the first nine months;•partially offset by a decrease in purchases from TACE of $9 million in the third quarter.Depreciation and amortization increased $23 million in the third quarter and $79 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to accelerated depreciation of equipment at two refineries, capital investments at our Galveston Bay refinery and the implementation of corporate-level information technology projects, partially offset in the first nine months of 2013 by an impairment of a light products terminal.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $37 million in the third quarter and $92 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to increases in contract services, employee compensation and benefit expenses and credit card processing fees. The increase in the first nine months included an increase in pension settlement expenses of $7 million resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred during that period.Other taxes increased $4 million in the third quarter and $29 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to increases in property taxes of $11 million and environmental taxes of $10 million, partially offset by decreases in sales and use taxes of $10 million and other tax expenses. The increase in the first nine months was primarily due to increases in payroll taxes of $16 million, property taxes of $12 million and environmental taxes of $11 million, partially offset by decreases in other tax expenses. Provision for income taxes increased $252 million in the third quarter and $123 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013, primarily due to changes in income before income taxes, which increased $758 million in the third quarter and $371 million in the first nine months. The effective tax rates for the third quarter and first nine months of both 2014 and 2013 are slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense.35Table of Contents The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment. Factors that could affect the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment include, but are not limited to, a change in business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Segment ResultsRevenues, including intersegment sales, are summarized by segment in the following table.

The increases in gasoline and distillate sales were primarily due to volume increases of 39 million gallons and 92 million gallons, respectively, primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores, partially offset by decreases in gasoline and distillate selling prices of $0.05 per gallon. The increases in merchandise sales were primarily due to an increase in the number of convenience stores and higher same store sales.The following table includes certain revenue statistics for the Speedway segment.

Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, mix and crude costs as well as other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had estimated positive impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income of $548 million for the third quarter and $1.39 billion for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. We believe the more favorable net product price realizations as compared to spot market values comprised a significant portion of the increases in segment income for both the third quarter and the first nine months. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs.

Other charge and blendstocks throughputs decreased 35 mbpd in the third quarter and 30 mbpd in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013 primarily attributable to the Garyville and Robinson refineries for both periods of 2014 and the Galveston Bay refinery for the third quarter of 2014. The decrease in the first nine months of 2014 was partially offset by higher other charge and blendstocks throughput at the Galveston Bay refinery.The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment.

The increases in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs were primarily attributable to the Catlettsburg and Galveston Bay refineries for the third quarter and the Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries for the first nine months. The increases in other manufacturing costs were primarily attributable to higher energy costs for both periods and higher catalyst expenses and routine maintenance costs for the first nine months. We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with purchased RINs decreased to $28 million in the third quarter and $121 million in the first nine months of 2014 from $78 million in the third quarter and $185 million in the first nine months of 2013. The decreases were primarily due to decreases in the average cost of ethanol and biomass-based biodiesel RINs and decreases in our estimated advanced biofuel and ethanol obligation volumes.39Table of Contents Speedway segment income from operations increased $17 million in the third quarter and decreased $21 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same periods of 2013. The increase in segment income for the third quarter was primarily due to an increase in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $22 million, or $0.0192 per gallon, and an increase in our merchandise gross margin of $11 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The decrease in segment income for the first nine months was primarily due to higher operating expenses and a decrease in our gasoline and distillate gross margin of $18 million, or $0.0132 per gallon, partially offset by an increase in our merchandise gross margin of $31 million. Operating expenses were higher primarily due to an increase in the number of stores. The increases in merchandise gross margin were primarily due to a combination of higher merchandise and food sales and improved margins.The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment.

The nine months ended September 30, 2013 includes the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $672 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013 primarily due to favorable changes in working capital of $306 million and an increase in net income of $248 million. Changes in working capital were a net $24 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2014 compared to a net $330 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2013. The net $24 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2014 was primarily due to an increase in inventories, partially offset by a decrease in current receivables and an increase in accounts payable. Changes from December 31, 2013 to September 30, 2014 per the consolidated balance sheets, excluding the impact of acquisitions, were as follows:•Inventories increased $731 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. 40Table of Contents •Current receivables decreased $424 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower outstanding refined product and crude oil receivable volumes. •Accounts payable increased $415 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes.The net $330 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2013 was primarily due to increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes and current receivables, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable. Changes from December 31, 2012 to September 30, 2013 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Inventories, excluding the impact of the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, increased $1.33 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to increases in crude oil and refined product inventory volumes. •Current receivables increased $983 million from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes, and an increase in income taxes receivable associated with federal income taxes. •Accounts payable increased $2.18 billion from year-end 2012, primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes related to the requirements of the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013 and higher crude oil prices at the end of the third quarter of 2013 compared to year-end 2012. Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 2014 was $1.77 billion higher than the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to the acquisition of Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets and higher capital expenditures in our Refining & Marketing segment in the first nine months of 2014, partially offset by the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets acquisition in February 2013.The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash.

The acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets comprised 60 percent of our total capital spending in the first nine months of 2013.41Table of Contents Net cash used in investments in affiliates increased $301 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to our contributions to North Dakota Pipeline of $149 million to fund the Sandpiper pipeline project, our contributions to Illinois Extension Pipeline of $97 million to fund the SAX pipeline project and our acquisition of an additional seven percent interest in Explorer for $77 million in the first nine months of 2014, partially offset by our acquisition of interests in TAAE, TACE and TAEI for $75 million in the first nine months of 2013. Net cash provided by all other investing activities was $78 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to $22 million for the first nine months of 2013, which consists primarily of sales of excess RINs of $74 million and $22 million, respectively.Financing activities were a net $864 million source of cash in the first nine months of 2014 compared to a net $2.64 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2013. The sources of cash for the first nine months of 2014 consisted of long-term debt borrowings. The uses of cash for both periods were primarily for common stock repurchases under our share repurchase plans and dividend payments. The first nine months of 2014 includes payment for the first period's contingent earnout for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.Long-term debt borrowings and repayments were a net $2.87 billion source of cash in the first nine months of 2014 compared to a $16 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2013. During the first nine months of 2014, we issued $1.95 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and borrowed $700 million under a term loan credit agreement to finance the acquisition of Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets. In addition, MPLX borrowed $270 million under its revolving credit agreement to fund the acquisition of an additional interest in Pipe Line Holdings and subsequently repaid $15 million. Cash used in common stock repurchases decreased $892 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.

Cash used in dividend payments increased $28 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to increases in our dividend payments totaling $0.22 per common share, from $1.12 per share to $1.34 per share, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.42Table of Contents Capital ResourcesOur liquidity totaled $5.65 billion at September 30, 2014 consisting of:  September 30, 2014(In millions) Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings AvailableCapacityRevolving credit agreement(a)$2,500 $— $2,500Trade receivables securitization facility1,300 — 1,300Total$3,800 $— $3,800Cash and cash equivalents    1,854Total liquidity    $5,654(a) Excludes MPLX’s $500 million revolving credit agreement, which had $245 million available as of September 30, 2014.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies.On August 26, 2014, we entered into a $700 million five-year senior unsecured term loan credit agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders to fund a portion of the purchase price of Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets. The Term Loan Agreement matures on September 24, 2019 and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. We are obligated to pay certain customary fees under the Term Loan Agreement, including an annual administrative fee.Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at either of the following rates at our election (i) the sum of the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), plus a margin ranging between 0.875 percent to 1.75 percent, depending on our credit ratings, or (ii) the sum of the Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), plus a margin ranging between zero percent to 0.75 percent, depending on our credit ratings. The interest rate during the quarter ended September 30, 2014 was 1.3 percent.On September 5, 2014, we completed a public offering of $1.95 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes (the "Senior Notes"), consisting of $750 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2024, $800 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2044 and $400 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due 2054. The net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes were approximately $1.915 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses. The proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price of Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets. Interest on each series of Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2015.The Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of ours and rank equally with all our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Term Loan Agreement, our revolving credit agreement (the “MPC Credit Agreement”) and the MPLX Credit Agreement contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2014, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.32 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC Credit Agreement.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). As of September 30, 2014, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 1.7 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.43Table of Contents Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of September 30, 2014, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows.Rating AgencyRatingMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook)Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.Neither the Term Loan Agreement, the MPC Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the Term Loan Agreement, the MPC Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 36 percent at September 30, 2014 and 23 percent at December 31, 2013.(In millions)September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Long-term debt due within one year$26 $23Long-term debt6,238 3,373Total debt$6,264 $3,396Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$6,264 $3,396Total equity11,266 11,332Total capital$17,530 $14,728Debt-to-total-capital ratio36% 23%Capital RequirementsWe have a capital and investment budget for 2014 of $2.43 billion, excluding capitalized interest and the acquisition of Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets. The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, our capital expenditures and investments were $1.31 billion, excluding capitalized interest and the $2.68 billion for the acquisition of Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets. Other than the acquisition of Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets, there have been no material changes to our 2014 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, we may be required to pay the seller a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. In July 2014, we paid $180 million for the first period's contingent earnout. See Notes 4 and 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.As of September 30, 2014, MPLX had $255 million in borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit agreement.During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we made contributions of $16 million to our funded pension plans. While we have no required contributions, we may make additional contributions to our funded pension plans in 2014 depending on the anticipated funding status and plan asset performance.44Table of Contents On October 29, 2014, our board of directors approved a $0.50 per share dividend, payable December 10, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 19, 2014.On July 30, 2014, our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization expiring in July 2016. During the first nine months of 2014, we paid $1.45 billion to acquire 17 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $87.25 per delivered share. At September 30, 2014, we also had agreements to repurchase additional common shares for $9 million, which were settled in early October 2014. As of September 30, 2014, we had $2.41 billion of remaining repurchase authorization. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.We may utilize various methods to effect additional repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.Contractual Cash ObligationsAs of September 30, 2014, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first nine months of 2014: •our committed payments on long-term debt, including interest, increased $4.90 billion in connection with the acquisition of Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets; •we assumed operating lease commitments totaling $423 million in connection with the acquisition of Hess' Retail Operations and Related Assets; •the MPLX Credit Agreement committed payments increased $264 million due to outstanding borrowings on the MPLX Credit Agreement, including interest and fees; and•we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.'s SAX pipeline, which increased our committed payments by $208 million. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.45Table of Contents Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 parts per million ("ppm") beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards. There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.Critical Accounting EstimatesThere have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.Accounting Standards Not Yet AdoptedIn August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update requiring management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Management will be required to assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt and the type of disclosure will be determined based on whether management's plans will be able to alleviate the substantial doubt. The accounting standards update will be effective for the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter with early application permitted. 46Table of Contents In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update for the elimination of the concept of development stage entity ("DSE") from U.S. GAAP and removes the related incremental reporting. The standards update eliminates the additional financial statement requirements specific to a DSE. In addition, it amends the consolidation model by eliminating the special provisions in the variable interest entity rules for assessing the sufficiency of the equity of a DSE. The portion of the accounting standards update related to the amendment to the consolidation guidance will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The portion of the accounting standards update related to the removal of the DSE reporting requirements will be effective on a retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of this standards update in the first quarters of 2015 and 2016 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update for revenue recognition that is aligned with the International Accounting Standards Board's revenue recognition standard issued on the same day. The guidance in the update states that revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a good or service. Recognition of the revenue will involve a multiple step approach including identifying the contract, identifying the separate performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the price to the performance obligations and then recognizing the revenue as the obligations are satisfied. Additional disclosures will be required to provide adequate information to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of reported revenues and revenues expected to be recognized. The accounting standards update will be effective on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with no early adoption permitted. At this point, a final determination has not been made as to the impact of the adoption of this standards update in the first quarter of 2017. However, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In April 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that redefines the criteria for determining discontinued operations and introduces new disclosures related to these disposals. The updated definition of a discontinued operation is the disposal of a component(s) of an entity or the classification of a component(s) of an entity as held for sale that represents a strategic shift for an entity and has (or will have) a major impact on an entity's operations and financial results. The standard requires disclosure of additional financial information for discontinued operations and individually material components not qualifying for discontinued operation presentation, as well as information regarding an entity's continuing involvement with the discontinued operation. The accounting standards update is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this standards update in the first quarter of 2015 is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.47Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.See Notes 15 and 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of September 30, 2014 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after September 30, 2014 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt as of September 30, 2014 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(In millions) Fair Value as of September 30, 2014(b) Change inFair Value Change in Net Income for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 Long-term debt(a)      Fixed-rate$5,269  $574(c)  n/a Variable-rate955 n/a 2(d) (a) Excludes capital leases.(b) Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(c) Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at September 30, 2014.(d) Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. At September 30, 2014, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX Credit Agreement. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX Credit Agreement, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.48Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2014, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2014, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.49Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions)2014 2013 2014 2013Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing$971 $227 $2,593 $2,235Speedway119 102 271 292Pipeline Transportation(a)69 54 222 163Items not allocated to segments:        Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(76) (59) (204) (190) Pension settlement expenses(21) (23) (90) (83)Income from operations$1,062 $301 $2,792 $2,417Capital Expenditures and Investments(b)(c)       Refining & Marketing$318 $243 $731 $1,797Speedway2,707 65 2,783 177Pipeline Transportation224 42 418 173Corporate and Other(d)29 61 80 121Total$3,278 $411 $4,012 $2,268(a) Corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX are included in the Pipeline Transportation segment.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.LitigationWe are a party to a number of lawsuits and other proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Environmental ProceedingsAs reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, we have been subject to a pending enforcement matter with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois attorney general’s office since 2002 concerning self-reporting of possible emission exceedances and permitting issues related to storage tanks at the Robinson, Illinois refinery. As a result of these allegations, we tentatively agreed to pay a $150,000 civil penalty and undertake a supplemental environmental project involving the installation of ambient air monitors at the refinery. The consent order is not yet finalized, but the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.We are involved in a number of other environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Item 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. Other than as discussed below, there have been no material changes to the risks or uncertainties found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. An easing or lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban could adversely affect crack spreads or crude oil price differentials and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Since the 1970s, the U.S. has restricted the ability of producers to export domestic crude oil. As total crude oil production has increased in the U.S. in recent years, primarily due to the increase in shale crude oil production, there have been increasing calls by crude oil producers and others for an easing or lifting of the crude oil export ban. If the export ban were to be significantly eased or lifted, the price of domestic crude oil would likely rise, potentially impacting crack spreads and price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils. A deterioration of crack spreads or price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results or operations and cash flows.53Table of Contents Item 2.
