Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements except to the extent required by applicable law.32Table of Contents CORPORATE OVERVIEWWe are a leading, integrated, downstream energy company. We own and operate the nation’s largest refining system with more than 3 million barrels per calendar day of crude oil capacity across 16 refineries, located in the West Coast, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. Our refineries supply refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to consumers through our Retail business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate branded outlets. We believe we are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers in the United States.We have three strong brands: Marathon®, Speedway® and ARCO®. Approximately 6,900 branded outlets, primarily carrying the Marathon brand name, are operated by independent entrepreneurs in 35 states, the District of Columbia and Mexico. We believe our Retail segment operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 3,920 convenience stores. Our Retail segment also sells transportation fuel to consumers through approximately 1,060 direct dealer locations. Our company-owned and operated locations primarily carry the Speedway® brand name and the direct dealer locations carry the ARCO® brand name.We are one of the largest midstream operators in North America. We primarily conduct our midstream operations through our ownership interests in MPLX and ANDX, which own and operate crude oil and light product transportation and logistics infrastructure as well as gathering, processing, and fractionation assets. As of March 31, 2019, we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately 16,600 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We distribute our refined products through one of the largest terminal operations in the United States and one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. Our integrated midstream gathering and processing network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets. Our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. As of March 31, 2019, our assets include approximately 9.9 bcf/d of gathering capacity, 11.1 bcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 790 mbpd of fractionation capacity. At March 31, 2019, our operations consisted of three reportable segments: Refining & Marketing; Retail; and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing – refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our 16 refineries in the West Coast, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services provided largely by our Midstream segment. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, to buyers on the spot market, to our Retail business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate primarily Marathon® branded outlets. •Retail – sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market across the United States through company-owned and operated convenience stores, primarily under the Speedway® brand, and long-term fuel supply contracts with direct dealers who operate locations primarily under the ARCO® brand. •Midstream – transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products principally for the Refining & Marketing segment via refining logistics assets, pipelines, terminals, towboats and barges; gathers, processes and transports natural gas; and gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs. The Midstream segment primarily reflects the results of MPLX and ANDX, our sponsored master limited partnerships. Recent DevelopmentsOn May 8, 2019, MPC, MPLX and ANDX announced that MPLX and ANDX have entered into a definitive merger agreement whereby MPLX will acquire ANDX in a unit-for-unit transaction at a blended exchange ratio of 1.07x. Under the terms of the merger agreement, ANDX public unitholders will receive 1.135 MPLX common units for each ANDX common unit held, representing a premium of 7.3 percent, and MPC will receive 1.0328 MPLX common units for each ANDX common unit held, representing a 2.4 percent discount, based on May 2, 2019 closing prices. As described in Notes 4 and 5, we consolidate ANDX in accordance with ASC 810 and previously recorded ANDX’s assets and liabilities to our balance sheet at preliminary fair values as of the Andeavor acquisition date of October 1, 2018. Upon closing of this merger, we will account for the unit-for-unit transaction as a common control transaction, which will result in a change in our noncontrolling interest and additional paid-in capital.The anticipated transaction simplifies MPLX and ANDX into a single listed entity to create a leading, large-scale, diversified midstream company anchored by fee-based cash flows. The combined entity will have an expanded geographic footprint that is expected to enhance its long-term growth opportunities and the sustainable cash flow profile of the business.33Table of Contents The transaction has been approved by MPLX’s and ANDX’s respective Conflicts Committees and both Boards of Directors. Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and receipt of regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2019. The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the proposed transaction between MPLX and ANDX. Factors that could affect the proposed transaction between MPLX and ANDX include, but are not limited to, the ability to complete the proposed transaction between MPLX and ANDX on the proposed terms and timetable; the ability to satisfy various conditions to the closing of the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement; the ability to obtain regulatory approvals for the proposed transaction on the proposed terms and schedule, and any conditions imposed on the combined entity in connection with the consummation of the proposed transaction; the risk that anticipated opportunities and any other synergies from or anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including whether the proposed transaction will be accretive within the expected timeframe or at all; disruption from the proposed transaction making it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers, employees or suppliers; other risk factors inherent to MPLX’s and ANDX’s industry; and risks related to MPC. For additional information on forward-looking statements and risks that can affect our business, see “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” herein, together with Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.34Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARYResultsSelect results are reflected in the following table. Our results include the results of Andeavor from the October 1, 2018 acquisition date forward.

Increased income from operations was more than offset by increased net interest and other financial costs, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Refer to the Results of Operations section for a discussion of consolidated financial results and segment results for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018.Andeavor AcquisitionOn October 1, 2018, we completed the Andeavor acquisition. Andeavor stockholders received in the aggregate approximately 239.8 million shares of MPC common stock valued at $19.8 billion and approximately $3.5 billion in cash in connection with the Andeavor acquisition.Andeavor was a highly integrated marketing, logistics and refining company operating primarily in the Western and Mid-Continent United States. Andeavor’s operations included procuring crude oil from its source or from other third parties, transporting the crude oil to one of its 10 refineries, and producing, marketing and distributing refined products. Its marketing system included more than 3,300 stations marketed under multiple well-known fuel brands including ARCO®. Also, we acquired the general partner and 156 million common units of ANDX, which is a publicly traded limited partnership that was formed to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets. Its assets are integral to the success of our refining and marketing operations and are used to gather crude oil, natural gas, and water, process natural gas and distribute, transport and store crude oil and refined products. This transaction combined two strong, complementary companies to create a leading nationwide U.S. downstream energy company. The acquisition substantially increases our geographic diversification and scale and strengthens each of our operating segments by diversifying our refining portfolio into attractive markets and increasing access to advantaged feedstocks, enhancing our midstream footprint in the Permian Basin, and creating a nationwide retail and marketing portfolio all of which is expected to substantially improve efficiencies and our ability to serve customers. We expect the combination to generate up to approximately $1.4 billion in gross run-rate synergies within the first three years, significantly enhancing our long-term cash flow generation profile. MPLX and ANDXOn February 1, 2018, we contributed refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX in exchange for $4.1 billion in cash and approximately 114 million newly issued MPLX units. Immediately following the dropdown, our IDRs were cancelled and our economic general partner interest was converted into a non-economic general partner interest, all in exchange for 275 million newly issued MPLX common units. MPLX financed the cash portion of the February 1, 2018 dropdown with its $4.1 billion 364-day term loan facility, which was entered into on January 2, 2018. On February 8, 2018, MPLX issued $5.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a public offering. MPLX used $4.1 billion of the net proceeds of the offering to repay the 364-day term-loan facility. The remaining proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under MPLX’s revolving credit facility and intercompany loan agreement with us and for general partnership purposes.35Table of Contents The following table summarizes the MPLX distributions we received in the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 and ANDX distributions we received in the three months ended March 31, 2019.  Three Months Ended March 31,(In millions) 2019 2018Cash distributions received:   Limited partner distributions - MPLX$327 $171Limited partner distributions - ANDX146 —Total$473 $171We owned approximately 505 million MPLX common units at March 31, 2019 with a market value of $16.60 billion based on the March 29, 2019 closing price of $32.89 per common unit. On April 29, 2019, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.6575 per common unit payable on May 15, 2019. As a result, MPLX will make distributions totaling $523 million to its common unitholders. MPC’s portion of these distributions is approximately $332 million. We owned approximately 156 million ANDX common units at March 31, 2019 with a market value of $5.51 billion based on the March 29, 2019 closing price of $35.26 per common unit. On April 29, 2019, ANDX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $1.03 per common unit payable on May 15, 2019. As a result, ANDX will make distributions totaling $240 million to its common unitholders. MPC’s portion of this distribution is approximately $148 million, which is net of a $12.5 million quarterly waiver. This quarterly distribution waiver is scheduled to remain in effect through the quarter ending December 31, 2019.See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX and ANDX.Share Repurchases During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we returned $885 million to our shareholders through repurchases of approximately 14 million shares of common stock at an average price per share of $62.98. Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $18.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $13.98 billion of our common stock, leaving $4.02 billion available for repurchases as of March 31, 2019. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.LiquidityAs of March 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $755 million, excluding MPLX and ANDX cash and cash equivalents of $93 million and $29 million, respectively, no borrowings and $32 million in letters of credit outstanding under our $6.0 billion bank revolving credit facilities and no borrowings outstanding under our $750 million trade receivables facility, resulting in cash and available liquidity of almost $7.5 billion. As of March 31, 2019, MPLX had approximately $1.82 billion available through its bank revolving credit agreement and $1 billion available through its intercompany credit facility with MPC. As of March 31, 2019, ANDX had approximately $696 million available through its bank revolving credit agreements and $500 million available through its intercompany credit facility with MPC.OVERVIEW OF SEGMENTSRefining & MarketingRefining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing margin and refinery throughputs. Our Refining & Marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate West Coast, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. The following are used for these crack-spread calculations:•The West Coast crack spread uses three barrels of ANS crude producing two barrels of LA CARBOB and one barrel of LA CARB Diesel;36Table of Contents •The Mid-Continent crack spread uses three barrels of WTI crude producing two barrels of Chicago CBOB gasoline and one barrel of Chicago ULSD; and•The Gulf Coast crack spread uses three barrels of LLS crude producing two barrels of USGC CBOB gasoline and one barrel of USGC ULSD. Our refineries can process significant amounts of sweet and sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to crude oil referenced in these crack spreads. The amount of these discounts, the sweet and sour differentials, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing margin to differ from crack spreads. In general, larger sweet and sour differentials will enhance our Refining & Marketing margin.Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax)  Blended crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)$900Sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)450Sweet differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)370Natural gas price sensitivity(d) (per $1.00/MMBtu)300(a) Crack spread based on 38 percent WTI, 38 percent LLS and 24 percent ANS with Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast and West Coast product pricing, respectively, and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.(b) Sour crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: ANS, Argus Sour Crude Index, Maya and Western Canadian Select(c) Sweet crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: Bakken, Brent, LLS, WTI-Cushing and WTI-Midland(d) This is consumption based exposure for our Refining & Marketing segment and does not include the the effects to our Midstream segment.In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sour differential and the sweet differential, our Refining & Marketing margin is impacted by factors such as:•the selling prices realized for and the mix of refined products as compared to the assumptions used to calculate the market crack spreads;•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed as compared to the assumptions used to calculate the market crack spreads;•our refinery yields;•the cost of products purchased for resale; •the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; and•the potential impact of LCM adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices.Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the LIFO inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Costs for planned turnaround, major maintenance and engineering projects are expensed in the period incurred. We have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with MPLX and ANDX. Under these agreements, MPLX and ANDX, which are reported in our Midstream segment, provide transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to our Refining & Marketing segment. Certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, refined products and other products. Certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets. Retail Retail segment profitability is impacted by fuel and merchandise margin. Fuel margin for gasoline and distillate is the price paid by consumers or direct dealers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees (where applicable). Gasoline and distillate prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply 37Table of Contents and demand in the regions where we operate. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. The margin on merchandise sold at our convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to our Retail segment margin. Our Retail convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of refined products and merchandise are stated under the LIFO inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. Midstream Our Midstream segment transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products, principally for our Refining & Marketing segment. The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. The profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. The profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products. The profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our Refining & Marketing segment and our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our Refining & Marketing segment. As discussed above in the Refining & Marketing section, MPLX and ANDX, which are reported in our Midstream segment, have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements related to services provided to our Refining & Marketing segment. Under these agreements, MPLX and ANDX have received various commitments of minimum throughput, storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport, store, distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. Our Midstream segment also gathers and processes natural gas and NGLs. NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our Midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing at our own or third‑party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations. Our results include the results of Andeavor from the October 1, 2018 acquisition date forward. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Financial Statements and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance. 38Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended March 31,(In millions) 2019 2018 VarianceRevenues and other income:     Sales and other operating revenues$28,081 $18,694 $9,387Sales to related parties186 172 14Income from equity method investments99 86 13Net gain on disposal of assets214 2 212Other income35 30 5Total revenues and other income28,615 18,984 9,631Costs and expenses:     Cost of revenues (excludes items below)25,756 17,370 8,386Purchases from related parties204 141 63Depreciation and amortization919 528 391Selling, general and administrative expenses881 402 479Other taxes186 103 83Total costs and expenses27,946 18,544 9,402Income from operations669 440 229Net interest and other financial costs306 183 123Income before income taxes363 257 106Provision for income taxes104 22 82Net income259 235 24Less net income attributable to:     Redeemable noncontrolling interest20 16 4Noncontrolling interests246 182 64Net income (loss) attributable to MPC$(7) $37 $(44)Net income (loss) attributable to MPC decreased $44 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increase in income from operations more than offset by increases in net interest and other financial costs, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. First Quarter 2019 Compared to First Quarter 2018Revenues and other income increased $9.63 billion primarily due to:•increased sales and other operating revenues of $9.39 billion primarily due to increased Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes, which increased 1,408 mbpd largely due to the Andeavor acquisition on October 1, 2018; and•increased net gain on disposal of assets of $212 million primarily due to a $207 million gain recognized in connection with MPC’s exchange of its undivided interest in the Capline pipeline system for an equity ownership in Capline LLC.Costs and expenses increased $9.40 billion primarily due to:•increased cost of revenues of $8.39 billion primarily due to the inclusion of costs related to the Andeavor operations following the acquisition;•increased depreciation and amortization of $391 million primarily due to the depreciation of the fair value of assets acquired in connection with the Andeavor acquisition; •increased selling, general and administrative expenses of $479 million primarily due to increased costs of the combined company subsequent to the acquisition of Andeavor and reflects MPC’s classification of costs and expenses; and•increased other taxes of $83 million primarily due to the inclusion of other taxes related to the acquired Andeavor operations.39Table of Contents Net interest and other financial costs increased $123 million primarily due to debt assumed in the acquisition of Andeavor and increased MPLX borrowings. Provision for income taxes increased $82 million primarily due to increased income before income taxes of $106 million and $36 million of state deferred tax expense recorded as an out of period adjustment related to the Andeavor acquisition. The combined federal, state and foreign income tax rate was 29 percent and 9 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was greater than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to $36 million of state deferred tax expense recorded as an out of period adjustment partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was less than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent primarily due to certain permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, state and local deferred tax benefits primarily resulting from the February 1, 2018 dropdown and GP/IDR Exchange and equity compensation. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $64 million primarily due to net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in ANDX.Segment ResultsRefining & MarketingThe following includes key financial and operating data for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Our results include the results of Andeavor from the October 1, 2018 acquisition date forward.40Table of Contents (a) Includes intersegment sales and sales destined for export.(b) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by total refinery throughputs.(c) See “Non-GAAP Measures” section for reconciliation and further information regarding this non-GAAP measure.(d) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs.(e) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs.(f) Primarily related to refined product distribution costs, including fees paid to our two sponsored master limited partnerships, MPLX and ANDX.41Table of Contents The following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment. Following the acquisition of Andeavor in October 2018, we expanded the benchmark prices included in these tables to include market information for the West Coast region of the United States, including LA CARBOB and LA CARB diesel spot prices, ANS crude prices and a West Coast ANS 3-2-1 crack spread. However, since the results of the Andeavor businesses are only included in our results from October 1, 2018 forward, these market indicators did not affect our results for the first quarter of 2018. The benchmark crack spreads below do not reflect the market cost of RINs necessary to meet EPA renewable volume obligations for attributable products under the Renewable Fuel Standard.

These blends are based on our refining capacity by region in each period.First Quarter 2019 Compared to First Quarter 2018Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $8.40 billion primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes, which increased 1,408 mbpd mainly due to the Andeavor acquisition on October 1, 2018, partially offset by decreased average refined product sales prices of $0.08 per gallon. Refining & Marketing segment loss from operations increased $201 million primarily driven by narrower crude discounts across our medium and heavy crude slate. Additionally, high industry gasoline inventories following the fourth quarter’s strong production environment resulted in weaker gasoline margins particularly in January of 2019. Based on the changes in the market indicators shown above, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales, we estimate a positive impact of $1.41 billion on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations, largely driven by a $1.54 billion benefit from increases in sales volume. Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including the effects of product price realizations, the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had an estimated negative effect of $120 million on Refining & Marketing segment income in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Refinery capacity utilization was 95 percent inclusive of turnaround activity during the first quarter of 2019 and crude oil throughputs increased 1,124 mbpd primarily due to the refineries acquired from Andeavor. 42Table of Contents Refining & Marketing margin was $11.17 per barrel for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $10.58 per barrel for the first quarter of 2018. Refinery direct operating costs decreased $0.02 per barrel. In the first quarter of 2019, planned turnaround and major maintenance costs decreased $0.99 per barrel, largely attributable to lower turnaround costs at our Galveston Bay refinery partially offset by higher turnaround costs at our Los Angeles and Robinson refineries. In the first quarter of 2019, other manufacturing costs were $0.94 per barrel higher primarily due to the refineries acquired in the Andeavor acquisition. Higher crude throughputs during the first three months of 2019 also reduced refinery direct operating costs per barrel.Other operating expenses totaled $1,308 million for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to $630 million for the first quarter of 2018. These costs are primarily related to refined product distribution costs, including fees paid to our two sponsored master limited partnerships, MPLX and ANDX. Included in these costs were fees paid to MPLX of $609 million and $478 million for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. The higher fees charged by MPLX were primarily due to one additional month of services provided to the Refining & Marketing segment in the first quarter of 2019 following the February 1, 2018 dropdown of refining logistic assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX. The balance of the increase was mainly driven by the inclusion of other operating expenses for the refining and marketing operations acquired from Andeavor.Supplemental Refining & Marketing Statistics Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018Refining & Marketing Operating Statistics   Refined product export sales volumes (mbpd)(a)430 265Crude oil capacity utilization percent(b)95 93Refinery throughputs (mbpd):(c)   Crude oil refined2,869 1,745Other charge and blendstocks215 160Total3,084 1,905Sour crude oil throughput percent52 52Sweet crude oil throughput percent48 48Refined product yields (mbpd):(c)   Gasoline1,533 917Distillates1,091 609Propane53 31Feedstocks and petrochemicals330 287Heavy fuel oil45 34Asphalt80 58Total3,132 1,936(a) Represents fully loaded export cargoes for each time period.

The Andeavor acquisition added approximately 1,100 company-owned and operated locations along with long-term supply contracts for approximately 1,060 direct dealers locations. Fuel sales volumes increased 1.11 billion gallons, almost all of which was related to the acquisition, and average fuel sales prices increased $0.06 per gallon. Merchandise sales increased $284 million resulting from the contributions of the acquired businesses.Retail segment income from operations increased $75 million primarily due to higher light product and merchandise margins largely related to the addition of the legacy Andeavor retail operations as well as a $24 million year-over-year increase in MPC's legacy Speedway segment earnings. These increases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses resulting from the locations acquired from Andeavor. The Retail fuel margin increased to 17.15 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 15.61 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2018 and the merchandise margin increased $88 million.MidstreamThe following includes key financial and operating data for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018.

These new businesses were reported in the Midstream segment prospectively from February 1, 2018. Midstream segment revenue increased $845 million primarily due to the inclusion of ANDX revenues subsequent to the Andeavor acquisition on October 1, 2018. In addition, the first quarter of 2019 reflects a full quarter of fees charged for fuels distribution and refining logistics services provided to Refining & Marketing as compared to only two months of fees in the first quarter of 2018 following the February 1, 2018 dropdown to MPLX.Midstream segment income from operations increased $341 million largely due to contributions of $220 million from ANDX and a $121 million increase in Midstream segment results driven primarily by growth across MPLX’s businesses.Items not Allocated to SegmentsKey Financial Information (in millions)  Three Months Ended March 31,  2019 2018Items not allocated to segments:   Corporate and other unallocated items(a)$(191) $(89)Capline restructuring gain207 —Transaction-related costs(91) —(a) Corporate and other unallocated items consists primarily of MPC’s corporate administrative expenses and costs related to certain non-operating assets, except for corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX and ANDX, which are included in the Midstream segment. Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing and Retail segments.First Quarter 2019 Compared to First Quarter 2018Corporate and other unallocated items increased $102 million largely due to increased costs and expenses for the combined company after the Andeavor acquisition. 46Table of Contents Other unallocated items include a $207 million gain resulting from the agreements executed with Capline LLC to contribute our 33 percent undivided interest in the Capline pipeline system in exchange for a 33 percent ownership interest in Capline LLC. Other unallocated items also include transaction-related costs of $91 million associated with the Andeavor acquisition. The transaction-related costs recognized in the first quarter largely relate to the recognition of an obligation for vacation benefits provided to former Andeavor employees.Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to its most comparable GAAP financial measure, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures we use are as follows:Refining & Marketing MarginRefining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes any LCM inventory market adjustment.

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities are presented in the following table. Our cash flows reflect the results of the business acquired in connection with the Andeavor acquisition from October 1, 2018 forward.

Changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt.Changes in working capital, excluding changes in short-term debt, were a net $470 million source of cash in the first three- months of 2019 compared to a net $933 million use of cash in the first three months of 2018. For the first three months of 2019, changes in working capital, excluding changes in short-term debt, were a net $470 million source of cash primarily due to the effects of increasing energy commodity prices at the end of the period on working capital. Accounts payable increased primarily due to an increase in crude prices. Current receivables increased primarily due to higher refined product and crude prices and higher crude sales volumes. Inventories decreased due to decreases in refined product and merchandise inventories partially offset by increases in crude and materials and supplies inventories. For the first three months of 2018, changes in working capital, excluding changes in short-term debt, were a net $933 million use of cash primarily due to the effect of decreases in volumes partially offset by increases in energy commodity prices at the end of the period on working capital. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude oil volumes purchased slightly offset by higher crude oil prices. Inventories decreased due to decreases in crude, refined products and materials and supplies inventories. Current receivables decreased primarily due to lower refined product volumes slightly offset by higher prices.48Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities increased $742 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to the first three months of 2018, primarily due to the following:•An increase in additions to property, plant and equipment of $486 million primarily due to increased capital expenditures in the first three months of 2019 in our Midstream and Refining & Marketing segments; and•an increase in net investments of $282 million largely due to investments in connection with the construction of the Gray Oak Pipeline, which is scheduled to commence operations in the fourth quarter of 2019.The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment per the consolidated statements of cash flows to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows.

During the first three months of 2019, MPLX had net borrowings of $425 million under its revolving credit facility and ANDX had net borrowings of $159 million under its revolving credit facility. During the first three months of 2018, MPLX issued $5.5 billion of senior notes, we redeemed $600 million of our senior notes and MPLX repaid $505 million in outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. •Cash used in common stock repurchases decreased $442 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to the first three months of 2018. Share repurchases totaled $885 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to $1.33 billion in the first three months of 2018. In 2018, share repurchases were funded primarily by after tax proceeds from the February 1, 2018 dropdown. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share repurchases.•Cash used in dividend payments increased $135 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to the first three months of 2018, primarily due to a net increase in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding related to the Andeavor acquisition and a $0.07 per share increase in our base dividend, partially offset by a reduction of shares resulting from share repurchases. Our dividend payments were $0.53 per common share in the first three months of 2019 compared to $0.46 per common share in the first three months of 2018.•Cash used in distributions to noncontrolling interests increased $130 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to the first three months of 2018, primarily due to the addition of ANDX distributions subsequent to the acquisition of Andeavor and an increase in MPLX’s distribution per common unit. •Contributions from noncontrolling interests increased $94 million in the first three months of 2019 compared to the first three months of 2018 primarily due to cash received in 2019 for an increased noncontrolling interest in an MPLX subsidiary.

We have a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2019, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. See Note 17 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt.The MPC credit agreements contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC credit agreements requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC credit agreements) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of March 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this financial covenant, with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.22 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPC bank revolving credit facility.The MPLX credit agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The MPLX credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. Other covenants restrict MPLX and/or certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of March 31, 2019, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant, with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.85 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX credit agreement.The ANDX credit agreements contain certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a financial covenant that requires ANDX to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the ANDX credit agreements) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA used to calculate the Consolidated Leverage Ratio is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. The covenants also restrict, among other things, ANDX’s ability and/or the ability of certain of its subsidiaries to incur debt, create liens on assets and enter into transactions with affiliates. As of March 31, 2019, ANDX was in compliance with this debt covenant, with a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.86 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the ANDX credit agreements..50Table of Contents Our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. As of March 31, 2019, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were as follows. CompanyRating AgencyRatingMPCMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook) FitchBBB (stable outlook)MPLXMoody’sBaa3 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook) FitchBBB- (positive outlook)ANDXMoody’sBa1 (review for upgrade) Standard & Poor’sBBB- (positive watch) FitchBBB- (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. None of the MPC credit agreements, the MPLX credit agreement, the ANDX credit agreements or our trade receivables facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment-grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements.Capital RequirementsCapital SpendingMPC's capital investment plan for 2019 totals approximately $2.8 billion for capital projects and investments, excluding MPLX, ANDX, capitalized interest and acquisitions. MPC’s capital investment plan includes approximately $1.8 billion of growth capital and $1.0 billion of maintenance capital. This plan includes all of the planned capital spending for Refining & Marketing, Retail and Corporate as well as a portion of the planned capital investments in Midstream. MPLX’s capital investment plan for 2019, excluding capitalized interest and acquisitions, includes $2.2 billion of organic growth capital and approximately $200 million of maintenance capital. ANDX’s capital investment plan for 2019, excluding capitalized interest and acquisitions, includes $600 million of organic growth capital and approximately $100 million of maintenance capital. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant. Capital expenditures and investments are summarized by segment below. These amounts include capital spending and investments related to businesses acquired in connection with the Andeavor acquisition from October 1, 2018 forward.

The Midstream segment capital investment plan includes projects for MPLX and ANDX. MPLX’s capital investment plan includes the addition of approximately 825 MMcf/d of processing capacity at five gas processing plants, two in the Marcellus and three in the Southwest, which expands MPLX’s processing capacity in the Permian Basin and the STACK shale play of Oklahoma. The MPLX capital investment plan also includes the addition of approximately 100 mbpd of fractionation capacity in the Marcellus and Utica basins and the continued expansion of MPLX’s marine fleet, long-haul crude 51Table of Contents oil, natural gas and NGL pipelines as well as projects to increase its export capability. The ANDX capital investment plan includes the construction of additional crude storage capacity for unloading of marine vessels, the construction of crude gathering systems to provide connectivity to multiple long-haul pipelines and a pipeline interconnect project to provide direct connectivity between certain MPC refineries. The remaining Midstream segment’s capital expenditure projects relate to investments in equity affiliate pipelines, including our expected investments in the Gray Oak Pipeline, a new pipeline spanning from the West Texas Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast which is expected to be in service by the end of 2019.The Refining & Marketing segment capital investment plan includes projects focused on high-return investments in refinery optimization, production of higher value products, increased capacity to upgrade residual fuel oil and expanded export capacity. We also plan to continue investing in domestic light products supply placement flexibility.Other Capital RequirementsDuring the three months ended March 31, 2019, we made no contributions to our funded pension plans, however, we have required funding for the 2019 plan year of approximately $64 million and we may choose to make additional contributions to our pension plans. On April 24, 2019, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.53 per share on common stock. The dividend is payable June 10, 2019, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 16, 2019. We may, from time to time, repurchase our senior notes in the open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.Share RepurchasesSince January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $18.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $13.98 billion of our common stock, leaving $4.02 billion available for repurchases at March 31, 2019. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.  Three Months Ended March 31,(In millions, except per share data)2019 2018Number of shares repurchased14 19Cash paid for shares repurchased$885 $1,327Average cost per share$62.98 $68.74We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.Contractual Cash Obligations As of March 31, 2019, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first three months of 2019, our long-term debt commitments decreased approximately $230 million due to interest payments made during the quarter partially offset by increased borrowings on the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and ANDX bank revolving credit facilities. There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2018.52Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under U.S. GAAP. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 24 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE COSTSWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. From 2014 through 2018, we made approximately $490 million in capital expenditures to comply with these standards, and expect to make approximately $260 million in capital expenditures for these standards in 2019.There have been no significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2019.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESAs of March 31, 2019, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTEDAs discussed in Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future.53Table of Contents ITEM 3.

The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under our variable-rate debt, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.See Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fair value of our debt.ITEM 4.
