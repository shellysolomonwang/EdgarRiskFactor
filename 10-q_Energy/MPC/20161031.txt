Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.Corporate OverviewWe are an independent petroleum refining and marketing, retail and midstream services company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.8 million barrels per calendar day. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast, Northeast, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest terminal operations in the United States and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area.We have two strong retail brands: Speedway® and Marathon®. We believe that Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,770 convenience stores in 22 states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, and is available through approximately 5,400 retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 states.Through our ownership interests in MPLX and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MarkWest, we believe we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the United States, the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions and we distribute refined products through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas and NGLs from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets. Our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. Our assets include approximately 5,500 MMcf/d of gathering capacity, 7,500 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 500 mbpd of fractionation capacity. We also own more than 5,500 miles of gas gathering and NGL pipelines and have ownership interests in more than 50 gas processing plants, more than 10 NGL fractionation facilities and two condensate stabilization facilities. We own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,400 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX. In previous periods, our inland marine business and our investment in an ocean vessel joint venture, (Crowley Ocean Partners), were presented within our Refining & Marketing segment. They are now presented in our Midstream segment. Comparable prior period information has been recast to reflect our revised segment presentation.Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Midstream. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. •Refining & Marketing—refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon® retail outlets.•Speedway—sells transportation fuels and convenience merchandise in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. •Midstream – includes the operations of MPLX and certain other related operations. The Midstream segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs and transports and stores crude oil and refined products. 37Table of Contents Executive SummaryResultsSelect results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are reflected in the following table.  Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions, except per share data) 2016 2015 2016 2015Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing$306 $1,434 $1,324 $3,907Speedway209 243 569 538Midstream(a)258 93 626 286Net income attributable to MPC$145 $948 $947 $2,665Net income attributable to MPC per diluted share$0.27 $1.76 $1.78 $4.90(a) Excludes equity method investment impairment charges of $267 million and $356 million for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as discussed in Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements and goodwill impairment charges of $130 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as discussed in Acquisitions and Investments.Net income attributable to MPC was $145 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the third quarter and $947 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $948 million, or $1.76 per diluted share, and $2.67 billion, or $4.90 per diluted share, for the same periods of 2015. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $1.13 billion in the third quarter and $2.58 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Segment income in the first nine months of 2016 includes a non-cash benefit of $345 million related to the reversal of the Company's LCM inventory valuation reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit in the first nine months of 2016, the decreases in both periods were mainly the result of lower crack spreads.Speedway segment income from operations decreased $34 million in the third quarter and increased $31 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The decrease in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to lower light product margins and higher depreciation expense partially offset by increases in merchandise margins and light product sales volume. In the first nine months of 2016, segment income includes a non-cash benefit of $25 million related to the reversal of the Company's LCM inventory valuation reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the increase in segment income was primarily due to higher merchandise margins and a $24 million gain from the sale of a retail location, partially offset by lower light product margins and higher depreciation expense. The increases in depreciation are primarily related to the recent investments made in the business, including capital spending related to the Hess Retail acquisition in late 2014. Midstream segment income from operations increased $165 million in the third quarter and $340 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The increases were primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest’s operating results following the merger with MPLX on December 4, 2015, as well as earnings from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments. Strategic Actions to Enhance Shareholder ValueOn October 27, 2016, we announced several initiatives to enhance shareholder value, primarily focused on unlocking value from our portfolio of high-quality midstream assets.The strategic plan includes the following actions:•2017 Dropdowns. MPC plans to offer to MPLX assets contributing a total of approximately $350 million of annual EBITDA by the end of 2017, subject to market and other conditions. The first dropdown of assets contributing approximately $235 million of annual EBITDA is expected to occur by the end of the first quarter, pending requisite approvals. The transactions are expected to support increased limited and general partner distributions from MPLX and provide value creation for investors. MPLX's plans for funding these dropdowns would likely include transactions with MPC, including the potential for a substantial amount of equity issued to MPC.•Future Dropdown Strategy. Following these initial dropdown transactions, MPC would have an estimated $1 billion of annual EBITDA that could be dropped into MPLX to support the continued strong growth of partnership distributions and further enhance the value of MPC's limited and general partner interests in MPLX. Subject to market and other conditions, MPC intends to execute on these value-enhancing dropdowns as soon as practicable within the next three years, pending requisite approvals. 38Table of Contents •Highlighting the Value of the General Partner Interest. In addition to the expected dropdown transactions, MPC is evaluating strategic opportunities to highlight and capture the value of its general partner ownership interest in MPLX and optimize the cost of capital for the partnership. MPC has retained independent financial advisors to assist with this evaluation. The timing of any resulting transactions would be subject to market and other conditions.•Review of Segment Reporting. In connection with the above strategic actions to unlock value from its midstream assets, MPC also plans to evaluate changes to its internal financial reporting. This review will largely focus on the assets and earnings associated with its future dropdown strategy that are currently reported in the refining and marketing segment. MPC is working diligently on this assessment, which is likely to result in changes to its segment reporting beginning in 2017.MPLX LPAs of September 30, 2016, we owned a 24 percent interest in MPLX, including a two percent general partner interest. This ownership percentage assumes the conversion of the MPLX Class B Units in July of 2017 at 1.09 to 1.00 and the exchange of the MPLX preferred units on a one for one basis. On December 4, 2015, MPLX completed the MarkWest Merger. The total value of consideration transferred was $8.61 billion, consisting of $7.33 billion in equity and $1.28 billion in cash. At closing, we made a payment of $1.23 billion to MarkWest common unitholders and the remaining $50 million will be paid in equal amounts, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which will be paid in July 2017, in connection with the conversion of the MPLX Class B Units to MPLX common units. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the MarkWest Merger.Reorganization TransactionsOn September 1, 2016, MPC, MPLX and various affiliates initiated a series of reorganization transactions in order to simplify MPLX’s ownership structure and its financial and tax reporting. In connection with these transactions, MPC contributed $225 million to MPLX and the issued and outstanding MPLX Class A Units, all of which were held by MarkWest Hydrocarbon, a subsidiary of MPLX, were exchanged for newly issued common units representing limited partner interests in MPLX. The simple average of the closing prices of MPLX common units for the last 10 trading days prior to September 1, 2016 was used for purposes of these transactions. As a result of these transactions, MPC increased its ownership interest in MPLX by 7 million MPLX common units, or approximately 1 percent. Private Placement of Preferred UnitsOn May 13, 2016, MPLX completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million 6.5 percent Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the “MPLX Preferred Units”) for a cash price of $32.50 per unit. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the MPLX Preferred Units was used for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general partnership purposes. The approximate $1.3 billion of financing from the combination of the ATM issuances in the first quarter and this private placement should provide for MPLX’s anticipated funding needs for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017.The MPLX Preferred Units rank senior to all MPLX common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. The holders of the MPLX Preferred Units are entitled to receive quarterly distributions equal to $0.528125 per unit commencing for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, with a prorated amount from the date of issuance. Following the second anniversary of the issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units, the holders of the MPLX Preferred Units will receive as a distribution the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of per unit distributions paid to common units. The MPLX Preferred Units are convertible into MPLX common units on a one for one basis after three years, at the purchasers’ option, and after four years at MPLX’s option, subject to certain conditions. The MPLX Preferred Units are considered redeemable securities due to the existence of redemption provisions upon a deemed liquidation event which is considered outside our control. Therefore, they are presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheets. We have recorded the MPLX Preferred Units at their issuance date fair value, net of issuance costs. Since the MPLX Preferred Units are not currently redeemable and not probable of becoming redeemable in the future, adjustment to the initial carrying amount is not necessary and would only be required if it becomes probable that the security would become redeemable.39Table of Contents Contribution of Inland Marine Business to MPLXOn March 31, 2016, we contributed our inland marine business to MPLX in exchange for 23 million MPLX common units and 460 thousand general partner units. The number of units we received from MPLX was determined by dividing $600 million by the volume weighted average NYSE price of MPLX common units for the 10 trading days preceding March 14, 2016, pursuant to the Membership Interests Contribution Agreement. We also agreed to waive first-quarter 2016 common unit distributions, IDRs and general partner distributions, with respect to the common units issued in this transaction. The contribution of our inland marine business was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control and we did not record a gain or loss. ATM ProgramOn August 4, 2016, MPLX entered into a second amended and restated distribution agreement providing for the continuous issuance of up to an aggregate of $1.18 billion of common units, in amounts, at prices and on terms to be determined by market conditions and other factors at the time of any offerings under its ATM Program. MPLX expects to use the net proceeds from sales under the ATM Program for general partnership purposes including repayment of debt and funding for acquisitions, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, MPLX issued an aggregate of 18 million common units under the ATM Program, generating net proceeds of approximately $499 million. As a result of common units issued under the ATM Program during the period, we contributed approximately $10 million in exchange for general partner units to maintain our two percent general partner interest. Distributions from MPLXThe following table summarizes the cash distributions we received from MPLX during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015.  Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions) 2016 2015Cash distributions received from MPLX:   General partner distributions, including IDRs$134 $13Limited partner distributions99 70Total$233 $83The market value of the 86.6 million MPLX common units we owned at September 30, 2016 was $2.93 billion based on the September 30, 2016 closing unit price of $33.86. We also believe there is substantial value attributable to our two percent general partnership interest.On October 25, 2016, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.5150 per common unit payable on November 14, 2016. As a result, MPLX will make distributions totaling $233 million to its limited and general partners. MPC’s portion of these distributions is approximately $98 million. See Note 3 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on MPLX.Acquisitions and InvestmentsOn September 1, 2016, Enbridge Energy Partners announced that its affiliate, North Dakota Pipeline, would withdraw certain pending regulatory applications for the Sandpiper pipeline project and that the project would be deferred indefinitely. These decisions were considered to indicate an impairment of the costs capitalized to date on the project. We made contributions of $14 million to North Dakota Pipeline during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and have contributed $301 million since project inception to fund our share of the construction costs for the project. As the operator of North Dakota Pipeline, which owns the investments made to date in the Sandpiper pipeline project, and the entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, Enbridge completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of August 31, 2016, in accordance with ASC Topic 360, to determine the fixed asset impairment charge. Based on the estimated liquidation value of the fixed assets, an impairment charge was recorded by North Dakota Pipeline. Based on our 37.5 percent ownership of North Dakota Pipeline, we recognized approximately $267 million of this charge in the third quarter of 2016 through “Income (loss) from equity method investments” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. See Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information regarding the charge.40Table of Contents MPLX currently expects to participate in a joint venture with Enbridge Energy Partners to acquire a 9.1875 percent equity interest in the Dakota Access Pipeline (“DAPL”) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company Pipeline (“ETCOP”) projects, collectively referred to as the Bakken Pipeline system, from Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (“ETP”) and Sunoco Logistics Partners, L.P. (“SXL”) for $500 million. Furthermore, MPC expects to become a committed shipper on the Bakken Pipeline system under terms of an on-going open season. The acquisition remains subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Bakken Pipeline system is currently expected to deliver in excess of 470,000 barrels per day of crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks production area in North Dakota to the Midwest through Patoka, Illinois and ultimately to the Gulf Coast. ETP and SXL collectively own a 75 percent interest in each of the two joint ventures that are developing the Bakken Pipeline system. MPLX and Enbridge Energy Partners will participate in a new joint venture to acquire 49 percent of ETP and SXL’s 75 percent indirect interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. MPLX will own 25 percent of this new joint venture with Enbridge, which results in a 9.1875 percent indirect ownership interest in the Bakken Pipeline system. MPLX expects to account for its investment using the equity method of accounting. Subject to the closing of the transaction with ETP and SXL, Enbridge Energy Partners has agreed to cancel MPC’s transportation services agreement with respect to the Sandpiper pipeline project and release MPC from paying any termination fee per that agreement.In June 2016, Speedway and Pilot Flying J signed a definitive agreement for a joint venture consisting of 120 travel plazas, primarily in the Southeast United States. The new entity, PFJ Southeast LLC, will initially consist of 41 existing locations contributed by Speedway and 79 locations contributed by Pilot Flying J, all of which will carry either the Pilot or Flying J brand and will be operated by Pilot Flying J. This transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances.We currently have indirect ownership interests in two ocean vessel joint ventures with Crowley, which were established to own and operate Jones Act vessels in petroleum product service.In September 2015, we acquired a 50 percent ownership interest in a joint venture, Crowley Ocean Partners, with Crowley. The joint venture owns and operates four new Jones Act product tankers, three of which are leased to MPC. Two of the vessels were delivered in 2015, the third was delivered in April 2016 and the fourth was delivered in August 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we contributed $69 million in connection with the delivery of the third and fourth vessels. We have contributed a total of $141 million for the four vessels.In May 2016, MPC and Crowley formed a new ocean vessel joint venture, Crowley Coastal Partners, in which MPC has a 50 percent ownership interest. MPC and Crowley each contributed their 50 percent ownership in Crowley Ocean Partners, discussed above, into Crowley Coastal Partners. In addition, we contributed $48 million in cash and Crowley contributed its 100 percent ownership interest in Crowley Blue Water Partners to Crowley Coastal Partners. Crowley Blue Water Partners is an entity that owns and operates three 750 Series ATB vessels that are leased to MPC. We account for our 50 percent interest in Crowley Coastal Partners as part of our Midstream segment using the equity method of accounting.See Note 5 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on Crowley Coastal Partners as a VIE and Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of Crowley Ocean Partners and Crowley Blue Water Partners.On December 4, 2015, MPLX merged with MarkWest, whereby MarkWest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX. Each common unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the MarkWest Merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of MPLX representing limited partner interests in MPLX, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 per unit. Each Class B unit of MarkWest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one Class B unit of MPLX having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations that the Class B units of MarkWest had immediately prior to the merger. At closing, we contributed $1.23 billion in cash to MPLX to pay the cash consideration to MarkWest common unitholders. We will contribute an additional total of $50 million in cash to MPLX for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the MPLX Class B Units to MPLX common units in equal installments, the first of which was paid in July 2016 and the second of which will be paid in July 2017. These contributions are with respect to MPC’s existing interests in MPLX (including IDRs) and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in MPLX. We assigned the total consideration transferred of $8.61 billion, including the $7.33 billion fair value of the equity consideration and the $1.28 billion of cash contributions, to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities and noncontrolling interest assumed in the MarkWest Merger, with the excess recorded as goodwill. During the first quarter of 2016, the preliminary fair value measurements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed recorded in the 2015 year-end financial statements were revised based on additional analysis. These adjustments to the fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and equity investments, among other items, resulted in an offsetting 41Table of Contents reduction to goodwill of approximately $241 million. As a result, we recognized total assets acquired of $11.91 billion, including $8.52 billion of property plant and equipment and $2.60 billion of equity investments, and total liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed of $5.51 billion, including $4.57 billion of assumed debt. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances. MPLX recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the first quarter to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. In the second quarter of 2016, MPLX completed its purchase price allocation, which resulted in an additional $1 million of impairment expense that would have been recorded in the first quarter of 2016 had the purchase price allocation been completed as of that date. This adjustment to the impairment expense was the result of completing an evaluation of the deferred tax liabilities associated with the MarkWest Merger and their impact on the resulting goodwill that was recognized.See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a discussion of this interim assessment of goodwill. See Note 14 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for information on goodwill recorded from the MarkWest Merger. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the acquisition.Consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business, the MarkWest Merger combines one of the nation’s largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by MPC. The complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of MarkWest, MPLX and MPC provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. The combined entity will further MarkWest's leading midstream presence in the Marcellus and Utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects, which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions. In addition, the combination provides significant vertical integration opportunities, as MPC is a large consumer of NGLs.Share Repurchases Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $10.0 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $7.42 billion of our common stock, leaving $2.58 billion available for repurchases. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we have acquired 4 million common shares at an average cost per share of $41.14 under these authorizations. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.LiquidityAs of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $709 million, unused $3.5 billion bank revolving credit facilities and approximately $740 million of availability under our $750 million trade receivables facility based on eligible trade receivables. Availability under MPC’s trade receivables facility is a function of eligible accounts receivable, which will be lower in a sustained lower refined product price environment. As of September 30, 2016, we do not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. The above amounts exclude MPLX’s $2.0 billion bank revolving credit facility, which as of September 30, 2016, had no borrowings and $3 million letters of credit outstanding. During the first nine months of 2016, MPLX used proceeds from its issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units to repay amounts outstanding under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and MPC chose to prepay $500 million under its term loan. On July 20, 2016, we amended our trade receivables facility to, among other things, reduce the capacity from $1.0 billion to $750 million and to extend the maturity date to July 19, 2019. The reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment.On July 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing MPC bank revolving credit facility due in 2017. The new agreement provides for a four-year $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on July 20, 2020. Additionally, we entered into a 364-day $1.0 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on July 19, 2017. The financial covenants contained in these agreements remain the same as under the previous bank revolving credit facility.42Table of Contents The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to certain strategic initiatives and our growth and vertical integration opportunities with respect to our midstream assets, the pending joint venture with Pilot Flying J, MPLX’s investment in the Bakken Pipeline system and our share repurchase authorizations.

The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and USGC crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. LLS prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ULSD and 1 barrel of three percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations.Refined product prices have historically moved relative to international crude oil prices like Brent crude. In recent years, domestic U.S. crude oils, such as WTI and LLS, have traded at prices less than Brent due to the growth in U.S. crude oil production, logistical constraints and other market factors. These price discounts had favorably impacted the LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread. The decline in crude oil prices in 2015 and continuing into the first quarter of 2016 has led to declines in sequential (month on month) onshore U.S. crude oil production and narrowed the LLS discount to Brent. With the end of the ban on U.S. crude oil exports, LLS and Brent are expected to trade near parity. Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin.Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.43Table of Contents The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax)  LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity(a) (per $1.00/barrel change)$450Sweet/sour differential sensitivity(b) (per $1.00/barrel change)220LLS-WTI differential sensitivity(c) (per $1.00/barrel change)90Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change)140(a) Weighted 40 percent Chicago and 60 percent USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.(b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars].(c) Assumes 20 percent of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil.In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as:•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;•our refinery yields;•the selling prices realized for refined products;•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; •the cost of products purchased for resale; •the effect of changes to refined product prices on LCM inventory valuation reserves; and•the impact of liquidations of LIFO inventory layers with costs significantly above current market prices.Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. As of December 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value by $370 million, of which $345 million was allocated to our Refining & Marketing segment. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the LCM reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, market values for refined products continue to exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no LCM inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the third quarter. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover. The cost of inventories of crude oil and refinery feedstocks, refined products and merchandise is determined primarily under the LIFO method. During the second quarter of 2016, we recognized a permanent reduction in our refined products inventories for LIFO accounting purposes. The cost of these inventories was based on prices in early 2015, which were much higher than current prices. As a result, we recognized a pre-tax charge of approximately $54 million in connection with this LIFO inventory reduction. There were no liquidation of LIFO inventories for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Costs for planned turnaround, major maintenance and engineering projects are expensed in the period incurred. We had significantly more planned turnaround and major maintenance activities at our Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. SpeedwayOur retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand, including local competition, transportation fuel prices, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. 44Table of Contents The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway’s gross margin. Speedway’s convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items.Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market value. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the LIFO cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. As of December 31, 2015, costs of inventories on a consolidated basis exceeded market value by $370 million, of which $25 million was allocated to our Speedway segment. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost and we reversed the LCM reserve resulting in a benefit to cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, market values for refined products continue to exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no LCM inventory market valuation reserve at the end of the third quarter. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover. MidstreamNGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our profitability is directly affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability. The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines and marine vessels serve our Refining & Marketing segment. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements.45Table of Contents Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations  Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions) 2016 2015 Variance 2016 2015 VarianceRevenues and other income:           Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes)$16,618 $18,716 $(2,098) $46,184 $56,444 $(10,260)Income (loss) from equity method investments(208) 23 (231) (236) 58 (294)Net gain on disposal of assets1 2 (1) 26 6 20Other income49 17 32 106 71 35Total revenues and other income16,460 18,758 (2,298) 46,080 56,579 (10,499)Costs and expenses:           Cost of revenues (excludes items below)12,944 14,165 (1,221) 35,475 43,575 (8,100)Purchases from related parties128 61 67 359 219 140Inventory market valuation adjustment— — — (370) — (370)Consumer excise taxes1,914 1,988 (74) 5,633 5,759 (126)Impairment expense— 144 (144) 130 144 (14)Depreciation and amortization507 364 143 1,497 1,089 408Selling, general and administrative expenses420 392 28 1,199 1,143 56Other taxes112 95 17 332 296 36Total costs and expenses16,025 17,209 (1,184) 44,255 52,225 (7,970)Income from operations435 1,549 (1,114) 1,825 4,354 (2,529)Net interest and other financial income (costs)(141) (70) (71) (420) (215) (205)Income before income taxes294 1,479 (1,185) 1,405 4,139 (2,734)Provision for income taxes75 521 (446) 481 1,439 (958)Net income219 958 (739) 924 2,700 (1,776)Less net income (loss) attributable to:           Redeemable noncontrolling interest16 — 16 25 — 25Noncontrolling interests58 10 48 (48) 35 (83)Net income attributable to MPC$145 $948 $(803) $947 $2,665 $(1,718)Net income attributable to MPC decreased $803 million in the third quarter and $1.72 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. In both periods of 2016, decreases in income from operations for our Refining & Marketing segment were partially offset by increases in our Midstream segment. Income from operations decreased for our Speedway segment in the third quarter and increased for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. Income from operations for the first nine months of 2016 includes a non-cash benefit of $370 million related to the reversal of the Company’s LCM inventory valuation reserve. Items not allocated to segments includes impairment charges of $267 million in the third quarter and $356 million in the first nine months of 2016 related to equity method investments. See Segment Results for additional information.Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) decreased $2.10 billion in the third quarter and $10.26 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The decreases were primarily due to lower average refined product sales prices which decreased $0.24 per gallon and $0.39 per gallon, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. 46Table of Contents Income (loss) from equity method investments decreased $231 million in the third quarter and $294 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The decreases are primarily due to impairment charges related to equity method investments of $267 million and $356 million, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, partially offset by increases in income from new and existing pipeline and marine equity investments. Net gain on disposal of assets increased $20 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015, primarily due to the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016.Cost of revenues decreased $1.22 billion in the third quarter and $8.10 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The decreases were primarily due to:•decreases in refined product cost of sales of $1.23 billion and $7.97 billion, respectively, primarily due to decreases in raw material and finished product costs; partially offset by•increases in refinery direct operating costs of $36 million, or $0.15 per barrel of total refinery throughput, and $338 million, or $0.78 per barrel of total refinery throughput, primarily due to increased planned turnaround activity in 2016. Purchases from related parties increased $67 million in the third quarter and $140 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to:•increases in volumes transported by by Illinois Extension Pipeline, which is a pipeline affiliate that became operational in December of 2015, of $27 million and $82 million, respectively; •increases in transportation services provided by Crowley Ocean Partners, which is a new marine joint venture established in September of 2015, of $15 million and $32 million, respectively; and•increases in transportation services provided by Crowley Blue Water Partners, which is a new marine joint venture established in May of 2016, of $16 million and $22 million, respectively.Inventory market valuation adjustment decreased costs and expenses by $370 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. The December 31, 2015 LCM reserve of $370 million was reversed due to the sale of inventory quantities that gave rise to the 2015 reserve and a new LCM reserve of $385 million was established as of March 31, 2016 based on market prices at that time. As of June 30, 2016, market value exceeded cost due to increases in refined product prices during the second quarter and we reversed the LCM reserve resulting in reductions to cost of revenues of $370 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Consumer excise taxes decreased $74 million in the third quarter and $126 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to decreases in taxable refined product sales volumes and tax rates in certain locations.Impairment expense reflects a $130 million impairment charge recorded by MPLX in the first nine months of 2016 to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. The third quarter and first nine months of 2015 included a $144 million impairment charge related to the cancellation of the ROUX project at our Garyville refinery. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a discussion of the interim impairment assessment of goodwill. Depreciation and amortization increased $143 million in the third quarter and $408 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to depreciation of the fair value of the assets acquired in connection with the MarkWest Merger.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $28 million in the third quarter and $56 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest’s expenses, partially offset by a decrease in expenses in both periods. Other taxes increased $17 million in the third quarter and $36 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest’s taxes. Net interest and other financial costs increased $71 million in the third quarter and $205 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to interest on the debt assumed in the MarkWest Merger. 47Table of Contents Provision for income taxes decreased $446 million in the third quarter and $958 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to decreases in income before income taxes of $1.19 billion in the third quarter and $2.73 billion in the first nine months of 2016. The combined federal, state and foreign income tax rate was 26 percent and 35 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and 34 percent and 35 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 varies from the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to the effects of a lower forecasted annual effective tax rate as compared to the forecasted rate used for the first six months of 2016. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is slightly less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent tax differences related to the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (including their proportional share of the goodwill impairment charge recorded by MPLX), the domestic manufacturing deduction and state and local tax expense. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 is equivalent to the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent.

Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to the Refining & Marketing and Speedway segments.Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $1.13 billion in the third quarter and $2.58 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The decrease in the third quarter was due to a $6.52 per barrel decrease in gross margin, primarily resulting from lower crack spreads in both Gulf Coast and Chicago markets and lower product price realizations compared to the spot market product prices used in the LLS crack spread calculation. The Chicago and Gulf Coast LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread decreased from $12.18 per barrel in the third quarter of 2015 to $8.08 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016. In the first nine months of 2016, segment income includes a non-cash benefit of $345 million related to the reversal of the Company's LCM inventory valuation reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the decrease was primarily the result of lower crack spreads, less favorable product price realizations, unfavorable crude oil and feedstock acquisition costs relative to benchmark LLS crude oil, and higher operating costs, primarily related to increased turnaround activity. 50Table of Contents The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment’s business.

Increased volumes in both periods also had a positive impact on segment income.•The LLS-WTI crude oil differential decreased $2.14 per barrel for the third quarter and $2.65 per barrel for the first nine months, which had a negative impact on segment income of $69 million in the third quarter and $251 million for the first nine months.The above market indicators use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Differences in our results compared to these market indicators, including product price realizations, the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, as well as the effects of LCM inventory valuation adjustments, market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, had estimated negative impacts on Refining & Marketing segment income of $431 million for the third quarter and $246 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs. Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015Refinery Throughputs (thousands of barrels per day):       Crude oil refined1,791 1,744 1,708 1,735Other charge and blendstocks135 168 156 170Total1,926 1,912 1,864 1,905Sour crude oil throughput percent59 56 60 55WTI-priced crude oil throughput percent20 20 20 2051Table of Contents Crude oil throughputs increased 47 mbpd in the third quarter and decreased 27 mbpd in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to decreased planned turnaround and major maintenance activity at the Catlettsburg and Robinson refineries in 2016. The decrease in the first nine months is primarily the result of increased planned turnaround and major maintenance activity at the Galveston Bay refinery in 2016.The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment. Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30, 2016 2015 2016 2015Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel)(a)(b)$10.75 $17.27 $11.20 $16.08Refinery direct operating costs (dollars per barrel):(c)       Planned turnaround and major maintenance$1.62 $1.37 $1.72 $0.94Depreciation and amortization1.42 1.36 1.46 1.37Other manufacturing(d)4.01 4.17 4.03 4.12Total$7.05 $6.90 $7.21 $6.43(a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by total refinery throughputs.(b) Excludes LCM inventory valuation adjustments.(c) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs.(d) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs.Refinery direct operating costs increased $0.15 per barrel in the third quarter and $0.78 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015, primarily due to increases in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs of $0.25 per barrel and $0.78 per barrel, respectively. The increases in planned turnaround and major maintenance costs were primarily attributable to significant turnaround costs incurred by the Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 partially offset by a decrease in turnaround costs incurred by the Robinson and Catlettsburg refineries in the third quarter of 2016. Other manufacturing costs decreased $0.16 per barrel in the third quarter and $0.09 per barrel in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The decreases in other manufacturing costs for both periods were due to lower routine maintenance, waste and other operating expenses in addition to lower energy costs in the first nine months of 2016.We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard compliance. Our expense associated with purchased RINs increased to $80 million in the third quarter and $221 million in the first nine months of 2016 from $34 million in the third quarter and $151 million in the first nine months of 2015. The first nine months of 2015 includes a $46 million charge to recognize increased estimated costs for compliance with the renewable fuel standards for 2014 and 2015, particularly those for bio-mass based diesel and advanced biofuels. Excluding this charge, the increases for both periods of 2016 were primarily due to the effect of increased prices for bio-mass based diesel RINs.Speedway segment income from operations decreased $34 million in the third quarter and increased $31 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods of 2015. The decrease in the third quarter is primarily due to a decrease in our gasoline and distillate gross margins of $54 million, or $0.0373 per gallon, and higher depreciation expense, partially offset by increases in merchandise margins of $28 million and sales volume. Segment income includes a non-cash benefit of $25 million in the first nine months of 2016 related to the reversal of the Company's LCM inventory valuation reserve. Excluding the LCM benefit, the increase in segment income was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins of $57 million and a gain from the sale of a retail location of $24 million, partially offset by a decrease in our gasoline and distillate gross margins of $52 million, or $0.0154 per gallon, and higher depreciation expense. The increases in depreciation are primarily related to the recent investments made in the business, including capital spending related to the Hess Retail acquisition in late 2014.52Table of Contents The following table includes margin statistics for the Speedway segment.

The non-cash impairment charge in the third quarter related to our equity investment in the Sandpiper pipeline Project resulted from the indefinite deferral of this project. Impairment charges in the first nine months of 2016 also include $89 million related to an equity method investment held by MPLX and $130 million recorded by MPLX to impair a portion of the $2.21 billion of goodwill, as adjusted, recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger. The third quarter and first nine months of 2015 included a $144 million impairment charge related to the cancellation of the ROUX project at our Garyville refinery. See the Critical Accounting Estimates section for a discussion of the interim impairment assessment of goodwill and equity method investments. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash FlowsOur cash and cash equivalents balance was $709 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $1.13 billion at December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 are presented in the following table.  Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions) 2016 2015Net cash provided by (used in):   Operating activities$2,995 $3,253Investing activities(2,217) (1,428)Financing activities(1,196) (1,275)Total$(418) $550Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $258 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to a decrease in operating results, partially offset by a favorable change in working capital of $786 million. Changes in working capital were a net $105 million source of cash in the first nine months of 2016 compared to a net $681 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2015. The changes in working capital were primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a decrease in inventories, excluding the Company’s reversal of the non-cash LCM inventory valuation reserve, partially offset by an increase in current receivables. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt. Changes from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable increased $312 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher crude oil prices and higher volumes.53Table of Contents •Current receivables increased $209 million from year-end 2015, primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil prices.•Excluding the change in the Company’s LCM inventory valuation reserve of $370 million, inventories decreased $71 million primarily due to a decrease in refined product inventory volumes. The net $681 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by decreases in current receivables and inventory. Changes from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015 per the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:•Accounts payable decreased $1.67 billion from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil prices.•Current receivables decreased $934 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to lower crude oil and refined product prices. •Inventories decreased $86 million from year-end 2014, primarily due to decreases in refined product and crude oil inventory volumes. Net cash used in investing activities was $789 million higher in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. Increases in additions to property, plant and equipment, primarily due to the inclusion of MarkWest capital spending, and acquisitions and investments in affiliates, were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the disposal of assets.The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows.

Net cash contributed to equity method investments increased $3 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to contributions to our marine joint ventures of $117 million, MPLX equity affiliates of $56 million and Illinois Extension Pipeline of $32 million to fund the SAX pipeline project as compared to our contributions to Illinois Extension Pipeline of $94 million, our contributions to North Dakota Pipeline of $69 million and our contributions to Crowley Ocean Partners of $38 million in connection with the delivery of a new Jones Act product tanker in the first nine months of 2015. Cash from disposal of assets increased primarily due to the sale of a Speedway retail location in the first quarter of 2016.Financing activities were a net $1.20 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2016 compared to a net $1.28 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2015. In 2016, sources of cash from financing activities including approximately $1.48 billion in net proceeds from the issuances of the MPLX Preferred Units and MPLX common units and $714 million of long-term debt borrowings were more than offset by uses of cash in financing activities including long-term debt repayments of $2.11 billion, dividend payments, distributions to noncontrolling interests and common stock repurchases under our share repurchase authorizations. Financing cash flows in the first nine months of 2016 also reflect $164 million related to the contingent consideration payment to the seller of the Galveston Bay refinery.Long-term debt borrowings and repayments, including debt issuance costs, were a net $1.41 billion use of cash in the first nine months of 2016 compared to a net $91 million source of cash in the first nine months of 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, MPLX used proceeds from its issuance of the MPLX Preferred Units to repay amounts outstanding under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and MPC chose to prepay $500 million under its term loan. During the first nine months of 2015, MPLX used proceeds from its $500 million of MPLX senior notes to repay amounts outstanding under the MPLX Credit Agreement, as well as for general partnership purposes.Cash used in common stock repurchases decreased $596 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases for these periods. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the share repurchase authorizations.

As of September 30, 2016, noncontrolling interests held a 76 percent interest in MPLX, compared to a 28.5 percent interest as of September 30, 2015.Cash used in dividend payments increased $86 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015, primarily due to a $0.18 per share increase in our quarterly dividend payment, partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock attributable to share repurchases. Our dividend payments were $1.00 per common share in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $0.82 per common share in the first nine months of 2015.Derivative InstrumentsSee Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.55Table of Contents Capital ResourcesOur liquidity totaled $4.95 billion at September 30, 2016 consisting of:  September 30, 2016(In millions) Total Capacity Outstanding Borrowings AvailableCapacityBank revolving credit facility(a)$2,500 $— $2,500364 day bank revolving credit facility1,000 — $1,000Trade receivables facility(b)740 — 740Total$4,240 $— $4,240Cash and cash equivalents    709Total liquidity    $4,949(a) Excludes MPLX’s $2.0 billion bank revolving credit facility, which had $2.0 billion available as of September 30, 2016.(b) Availability under our $750 million trade receivables facility is a function of eligible trade receivables, which will be lower in a sustained lower price environment for refined products. As of October 31, 2016, eligible trade receivables supported borrowings of $665 million.Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, including a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. We may, from time to time, repurchase notes in the open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.On July 20, 2016, we amended our trade receivables facility to, among other things, reduce the capacity from $1.0 billion to $750 million and to extend the maturity date to July 19, 2019. The reduction in capacity reflects the lower refined product price environment.On July 20, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders to replace our existing MPC bank revolving credit facility due in 2017. The new agreement provides for a four-year $2.5 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on July 20, 2020. Additionally, we entered into a 364-day $1.0 billion bank revolving credit facility maturing on July 19, 2017. The financial covenants contained in these agreements remain the same as under the previous bank revolving credit facility.On February 26, 2016, we established a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2016, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. The MPC term loan agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”), MPC bank revolving credit facility and MPLX credit agreement, which provides for the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and the MPLX term loan facility (“MPLX Credit Agreement”), contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.32 to 1.00, as well as the other covenants contained in the Term Loan Agreement and the MPC bank revolving credit facility.The financial covenant included in the MPLX Credit Agreement requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. As of September 30, 2016, MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.5 to 1.0, as well as the other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.56Table of Contents Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of September 30, 2016, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. CompanyRating AgencyRatingMPCMoody’sBaa2 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB (stable outlook) FitchBBB (stable outlook)MPLXMoody’sBaa3 (stable outlook) Standard & Poor’sBBB- (stable outlook) FitchBBB- (stable outlook)The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.Neither the Term Loan Agreement, MPC bank revolving credit facility, MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables facility contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the Term Loan Agreement, the MPC bank revolving credit facility, our trade receivables facility and debt held by one of our ocean vessel joint ventures. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis or result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services agreements.Debt-to-Total-Capital RatioOur debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 34 percent at September 30, 2016 and 38 percent at December 31, 2015.(In millions)September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Debt due within one year$28 $29Long-term debt10,538 11,896Total debt$10,566 $11,925Calculation of debt-to-total-capital ratio:   Total debt$10,566 $11,925Redeemable noncontrolling interest1,000 —Total equity19,957 19,675Total capital$31,523 $31,600Debt-to-total-capital ratio34% 38% Capital RequirementsOur board approved a 2016 capital spending and investment plan of $4.2 billion towards the end of 2015. In February, we reduced our forecasted 2016 capital spending and investments to approximately $3.0 billion, excluding capitalized interest. The expected 2016 capital spending and investments also excludes our anticipated $500 million investment in the Bakken Pipeline system. This reduced forecast for capital spending and investments includes spending on refining, retail marketing and midstream projects as well as amounts designated for corporate projects. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our capital expenditures and investments were $2.19 billion, excluding capitalized interest. There have been no material changes to our 2016 capital and investment budget since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 was filed. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant.During the second quarter of 2016, we paid BP $200 million for the third year’s contingent earnout. Including this second quarter payment, we have paid BP approximately $569 million in total leaving $131 million remaining under the total cap of $700 million. See Note 15 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.57Table of Contents Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through the third quarter of 2016. At September 30, 2016, Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial’s assets. If market conditions were to change and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of September 30, 2016, our equity investment in Centennial was $35 million and we had a $30 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial’s outstanding debt. See Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the debt guarantee.We have no required funding requirements for our funded pension plans for 2016, but during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we chose to make a $100 million voluntary contribution. We may choose to make voluntary contributions for future years at our discretion. On October 26, 2016, our board of directors approved a dividend of $0.36 per share on common stock. The dividend is payable December 12, 2016, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 16, 2016. During the first nine months of 2016, we paid $177 million to acquire 4 million common shares through open market share repurchases. The effective average cost was $41.14 per delivered share. See Note 8 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.We may utilize various methods to effect additional share repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be affected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future share repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to our capital requirements, including our capital spending and budget plan, the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment, future contributions to our funded pension plans and share repurchases. Forward-looking statements about our capital requirements are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in our forward-looking statements regarding capital requirements include the availability of liquidity, business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial’s assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets, market price of our common stock, prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, continued/further volatility in and/or degradation of market and industry conditions, the effects of the lifting of the U.S. crude oil export ban, completion of pipeline capacity to areas outside the U.S. Midwest, our ability to successfully achieve the strategic and other expected objectives relating to the MarkWest Merger, modifications to MPLX earnings and distribution growth objectives, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Contractual Cash Obligations As of September 30, 2016, our contractual cash obligations included long-term debt, capital and operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. During the first nine months of 2016, our long-term debt commitments decreased $1.88 billion primarily due to repayment of borrowings under the MPLX bank revolving credit facility and our decision to prepay $500 million on the MPC term loan. Also, during the first nine months of 2016, our long-term transportation commitments decreased $432 million due to the suspension of a pipeline project for which the Company had made a commitment under a transportation services agreement previously scheduled to begin in 2018. As discussed in Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, in September 2016, Enbridge Energy Partners announced that its affiliate would withdraw certain pending regulatory applications for the Sandpiper pipeline project and that the project would be deferred indefinitely resulting in a $605 million decrease in our capital commitments to fund a portion of the construction costs of this pipeline beginning in 2016.MPLX currently expects to participate in a joint venture to acquire an equity interest in the Bakken Pipeline system for $500 million. Furthermore, MPC expects to become a committed shipper on the Bakken Pipeline system. Subject to the closing of this investment, Enbridge agreed to cancel our commitment under a long-term transportation services agreement related to the Sandpiper pipeline project. The effect of these transactions will be reflected in updates to our contractual commitments when they are effective.58Table of Contents There were no other material changes to our contractual cash obligations outside the ordinary course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under U.S. GAAP. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources.We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with our spinoff from Marathon Oil, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Note 22 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. Transactions with Related PartiesWe believe that transactions with related parties were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties.Environmental Matters and Compliance CostsWe have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $600 million to $700 million between 2014 and 2021 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards, which includes estimated capital expenditures of approximately $200 million in 2017.There have been no other significant changes to our environmental matters and compliance costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.Critical Accounting EstimatesImpairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method InvestmentsAs of September 30, 2016, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, except as noted below. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit. During the first quarter of 2016, MPLX, our consolidated subsidiary, determined that an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was necessary based on consideration of a number of first quarter events and circumstances, including i) continued deterioration of near term commodity prices as well as longer term pricing trends, ii) recent guidance on reductions to forecasted capital spending, the slowing of drilling activity and the resulting reduced production growth forecasts released or communicated by MPLX’s producer customers and iii) increases in the cost of capital. The combination of these factors was considered to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment test. Based on the first step of the interim goodwill impairment analysis, the fair value for the three reporting units to which goodwill was assigned in connection with the MarkWest Merger was less than their respective carrying value. In step two of the impairment 59Table of Contents analysis, the implied fair values of the goodwill were compared to the carrying values within those reporting units. Based on this assessment, it was determined that goodwill was impaired in two of the reporting units. Accordingly, MPLX recorded an impairment charge of approximately $129 million in the first quarter of 2016.The fair value of the reporting units for the interim goodwill impairment analysis was determined based on applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the expected future results and discount rates, which ranged from 10.5 percent to 11.5 percent. The fair value of the intangibles was determined based on applying the multi-period excess earnings method, which is an income approach. Key assumptions include attrition rates by reporting unit ranging from 5.0 percent to 10.0 percent and discount rates by reporting unit ranging from 11.5 percent to 12.8 percent. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim goodwill impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.MPLX did not record an impairment charge for one reporting unit assigned goodwill. As of March 31, 2016, MPLX’s allocation of the purchase price was provisional. Based on MPLX’s assessment as of that date, this reporting unit had $1.81 billion of goodwill assigned to it (which amount was not adjusted as of June 30, 2016 when MPLX finalized its purchase price allocation). Step one of the first quarter interim impairment analysis resulted in the carrying value of this reporting unit exceeding its fair value by 0.62%; therefore, MPLX completed step two of the goodwill impairment analysis. Step two of the goodwill impairment analysis requires MPLX to determine the fair value of all assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests, if any, of the reporting unit, whether or not currently recognized. The implied fair value of goodwill is the residual value of the reporting unit's fair value, less the fair value of the assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests, if any. The results of MPLX’s step two first quarter interim impairment analysis concluded that the fair value of the goodwill of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value of $1.81 billion by approximately $20 million, or 1.2%. An increase of 0.50% to the discount rate used to estimate this reporting unit’s fair value as of MPLX’s first quarter interim impairment analysis would have resulted in an additional goodwill impairment charge of more than $400 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The other significant assumption used to estimate this reporting unit's fair value included estimates of future cash flows. If estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by commodity prices and producers' production plans, for this reporting unit were to decline, the overall reporting unit's fair value would decrease, resulting in a potential goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, an increase in the cost of capital would result in a decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit, causing its value to decline and goodwill to potentially be impaired.During the second quarter of 2016, MPLX determined that an interim impairment analysis of the goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger was not necessary. The stabilization and, in some cases, improvement in the second quarter of the circumstances considered during its first quarter impairment analysis, the date of its last full goodwill impairment analysis, lead to its conclusion that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their respective carrying values. In the second quarter of 2016, MPLX completed its purchase price accounting for the MarkWest Merger. The completion of this accounting resulted in additional goodwill attributed to certain reporting units for which an impairment charge had been taken in the first quarter of 2016. MPLX therefore recorded an additional $1 million of impairment expense in the second quarter of 2016.Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flows of an asset group. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. In the first quarter of 2016, MPLX also considered whether there was any indication of impairment of long-lived assets and equity method investments recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger and determined that there were none.MPLX’s investments in Centrahoma, Jefferson Dry Gas, MarkWest Utica EMG, Ohio Condensate and MarkWest Pioneer were recorded at fair value based on the MarkWest Merger on December 4, 2015. If expected cash flows used to determine the fair value as of December 4, 2015 are not realized, its equity method investments may be subject to future impairment charges. Based on a review of cash flow forecasts as of the second quarter of 2016, MPLX has concluded that no indicators of an other than temporary impairment exist except for Ohio Condensate as discussed further below.60Table of Contents During the second quarter of 2016, forecasts for Ohio Condensate, an equity method investment, were reduced in line with updated forecasts for customer requirements. As the operator of that entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, MPLX completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of June 30, 2016, in accordance with ASC Topic 360, to determine the potential fixed asset impairment charge. The resulting fixed asset impairment charge recorded within Ohio Condensate’s financial statements was $96 million. Based on MPLX’s 60 percent ownership of Ohio Condensate, approximately $58 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in “Income (loss) from equity method investments” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income.MPLX’s investment in Ohio Condensate, which was established at fair value in connection with the MarkWest Merger, exceeded its share of the underlying net assets. Therefore, in conjunction with the ASC Topic 360 impairment analysis, MPLX completed an equity method impairment analysis in accordance with ASC Topic 323 to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated financial statements resulting from an other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, an additional impairment charge of approximately $31 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 in “Income (loss) from equity method investments” within the accompanying consolidated statements of income, which eliminated the basis differential established in connection with the MarkWest Merger.The fair value of Ohio Condensate and its underlying assets was determined based upon applying the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and the guideline public company method, which is a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known or knowable information at the interim measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of the fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management’s best estimates of the expected future results using a probability weighted average set of cash flow forecasts and a discount rate of 11.2%. An increase to the discount rate of 50 basis points would have resulted in an additional charge of $1 million on the consolidated statements of income. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As such, the fair value of the Ohio Condensate equity method investment and its underlying assets represents a Level 3 measurement. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the interim impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.During the third quarter of 2016, Enbridge Energy Partners announced that its affiliate, North Dakota Pipeline, would withdraw certain pending regulatory applications for the Sandpiper pipeline project and that the project would be deferred indefinitely. These decisions were considered to indicate an impairment of the costs capitalized to date on the project. As the operator of North Dakota Pipeline, which owns the investments made to date in the Sandpiper pipeline project, and the entity responsible for maintaining its financial records, Enbridge completed a fixed asset impairment analysis as of August 31, 2016, in accordance with ASC Topic 360, to determine the fixed asset impairment charge. Based on the estimated liquidation value of the fixed assets, an impairment charge was recorded by North Dakota Pipeline. Based on our 37.5 percent ownership of North Dakota Pipeline, we recognized approximately $267 million of this charge in the third quarter of 2016 through “Income (loss) from equity method investments” on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Also, in accordance with ASC Topic 323, we completed an assessment to determine the potential additional equity method impairment charge to be recorded on our consolidated financial statements resulting from an other-than-temporary impairment. The result of this analysis indicated no additional charge was required to be recorded.The fixed assets of North Dakota Pipeline related to the Sandpiper pipeline project consist primarily of project management and engineering costs, pipe, valves, motors and other equipment, land and easements. The fair value of fixed assets was estimated based on a market approach using the estimated price that would be received to sell pipe, land and other related equipment in its current condition, considering the current market conditions for sale of these assets and length of disposal period. The valuation considered a range of potential selling prices from various alternatives that could be used to dispose of these assets. As such, the fair value of the North Dakota Pipeline equity method investment and its underlying assets represents a Level 3 measurement. North Dakota Pipeline expects to dispose of these assets through orderly transactions. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted As discussed in Note 2 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements, certain new financial accounting pronouncements will be effective for our financial statements in the future.61Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a detailed discussion of our risk management strategies and our derivative instruments, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.See Notes 15 and 16 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for more information about the fair value measurement of our derivatives, as well as the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income. We do not designate any of our commodity derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes.Sensitivity analysis of the effects on income from operations (“IFO”) of hypothetical 10 percent and 25 percent increases and decreases in commodity prices for open commodity derivative instruments as of September 30, 2016 is provided in the following table.

Effects of these offsets are not reflected in the above sensitivity analysis.We evaluate our portfolio of commodity derivative instruments on an ongoing basis and add or revise strategies in anticipation of changes in market conditions and in risk profiles. Changes to the portfolio after September 30, 2016 would cause future IFO effects to differ from those presented above.Sensitivity analysis of the effect of a hypothetical 100-basis-point change in interest rates on long-term debt, including the portion classified as current and excluding capital leases, as of September 30, 2016 is provided in the following table. Fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued interest approximate carrying value and are relatively insensitive to changes in interest rates due to the short-term maturity of the instruments. Accordingly, these instruments are excluded from the table.(In millions) Fair Value as of September 30, 2016(a) Change inFair Value(b) Change in Net Income for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016(c)Long-term debt     Fixed-rate$10,606  $874 n/aVariable-rate450 n/a 10(a) Fair value was based on market prices, where available, or current borrowing rates for financings with similar terms and maturities.(b) Assumes a 100-basis-point decrease in the weighted average yield-to-maturity at September 30, 2016.(c) Assumes a 100-basis-point change in interest rates. The change to net income was based on the weighted average balance of debt outstanding for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, our portfolio of long-term debt was comprised of fixed-rate instruments and variable-rate borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX term loan facility. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt is relatively sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Our sensitivity to interest rate declines and corresponding increases in the fair value of our debt portfolio unfavorably affects our results of operations and cash flows only when we elect to repurchase or otherwise retire fixed-rate debt at prices above carrying value. Interest rate fluctuations generally do not impact the fair value of borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement and the MPLX term loan facility, but may affect our results of operations and cash flows.62Table of Contents Item 4. Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer. Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report.Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.63Table of Contents Supplementary Statistics (Unaudited) Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,(In millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Income from Operations by segment       Refining & Marketing(a)(b)$306 $1,434 $1,324 $3,907Speedway(b)209 243 569 538Midstream(a)(c)258 93 626 286Items not allocated to segments:        Corporate and other unallocated items(a)(c)(67) (75) (201) (229) Pension settlement expenses(4) (2) (7) (4) Impairments(d)(267) (144) (486) (144)Income from operations$435 $1,549 $1,825 $4,354Capital Expenditures and Investments(e)       Refining & Marketing(a)$267 $256 $788 $686Speedway71 130 191 275Midstream(a)394 156 1,147 400Corporate and Other(f)29 43 106 121Total$761 $585 $2,232 $1,482(a) We revised our operating segment presentation in the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the contribution of our inland marine business to MPLX; our inland marine business, which was previously included in Refining & Marketing, is now included in Midstream.

Legal ProceedingsWe are the subject of, or a party to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions, contingencies and commitments involving a variety of matters, including laws and regulations relating to the environment. Specific matters discussed below are either new proceedings or material developments in proceedings previously reported.LitigationWe are a party to a number of lawsuits and proceedings and cannot predict the outcome of every such matter with certainty. While it is possible that an adverse result in one or more of the lawsuits or proceedings in which we are a defendant could be material to us, based upon current information and our experience as a defendant in other matters, we believe that these lawsuits and proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.Environmental ProceedingsAs reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, on May 18, 2016, MarkWest Liberty Midstream & Resources, L.L.C., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX (“MarkWest Liberty Midstream”), received a draft Consent Order from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (“WVDEP”) alleging certain air permitting and emissions violations at our Sherwood Facility, a gas processing facility located in West Virginia, including failure to comply with monitoring, tagging, recordkeeping and repair requirements with respect to certain equipment at the facility as well as the failure to comply with certain permit application requirements. On September 6, 2016, MarkWest Liberty Midstream executed a final Consent Order with the WVDEP resolving these matters. Pursuant to the final Consent Order, MarkWest Liberty Midstream paid a $95,000 civil penalty and agreed to implement certain enhancements in connection with our existing leak monitoring program, provide additional training, and provide funding for certain programs and equipment for the WVDEP which is expected to cost approximately $140,000.As reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, on July 6, 2016, the EPA presented a draft administrative enforcement order to Cincinnati Renewable Fuels LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC that operates a biofuels production facility in Cincinnati, Ohio (“CRF”). The order alleged CRF and its predecessors failed to implement air regulations for a period beginning in May 2008 and prior to our acquisition of the facility. In the third quarter of 2016, CRF settled the enforcement action with the EPA. The settlement includes a $110,000 civil penalty and a $450,000 supplemental environmental project.As previously reported, in July 2015 representatives from the EPA and the United States Department of Justice conducted a raid on a MarkWest Liberty Midstream pipeline launcher/receiver site utilized for pipeline maintenance operations in Washington County, Pennsylvania pursuant to a search warrant issued by a magistrate of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. As part of this initiative, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania, with the assistance of EPA’s Criminal Investigation Division proceeded with an investigation of MarkWest’s launcher/receiver, pipeline and compressor station operations. In response to the investigation, MarkWest initiated independent studies which demonstrated that there was no risk to worker safety and no threat of public harm associated with MarkWest’s launcher/receiver operations. These findings were supported by a subsequent inspection and review by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. After providing these studies, and other substantial documentation related to MarkWest's pipeline and compressor stations, and arranging site visits and conducting several meetings with the government’s representatives, on September 13, 2016, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania rendered a declination decision, dropping its criminal investigation and declining to pursue charges in this matter.MarkWest Liberty Midstream continues to discuss with the EPA and the State of Pennsylvania alleged omissions associated with permits or related regulatory obligations for its launcher/receiver and compressor station facilities in the region. It is possible that in connection with any potential or asserted enforcement action associated with this matter, MarkWest Liberty Midstream will incur material assessments, penalties or fines, incur material defense costs and expenses, be required to modify operations or construction activities which could increase operating costs and capital expenditures, or be subject to other obligations or restrictions that could restrict or prohibit our activities, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The amount of any potential assessments, penalties, fines, restrictions, requirements, modifications, costs or expenses that may be incurred in connection with any potential enforcement action cannot be reasonably estimated or determined at this time.We are involved in a number of environmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome and impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the resolution of these environmental proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.67Table of ContentsItem 1A. Risk FactorsWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The discussion of such risks and uncertainties may be found under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
