Item 1A — Risk FactorsThere have been no material changes to the risk factors described in the 2013 Form 10-K, which are hereby incorporated by reference, except as set forth below. Accepting market derived income (MDI) may cause regulatory or other scrutiny, which may have a material and adverse effect on our business and our position.Insurance intermediaries have traditionally been remunerated by commission or fees paid by clients. Intermediaries also obtain revenue from insurance carriers. This is commonly known as market derived income or 'MDI'. MDI takes a variety of forms, including volume- or profit-based contingent commissions, facilities administration charges, business development agreements, and fees for providing certain data to carriers. MDI creates various risks. Intermediaries have a duty to act in the best interests of their clients and payments from carriers can incentivize intermediaries to put carriers’ interests ahead of their clients. Accordingly, MDI may be subject to scrutiny by various regulators under conflict of interest, anti-trust, unfair competition, and anti-bribery laws and regulations. While accepting MDI is a lawful and acceptable business practice, and while we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot predict whether our position will cause regulatory or other scrutiny.Item 2 — Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
