Item 1A—Risk Factors      Other than as discussed below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A ‘Risk Factors’ included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010.     Our compliance systems and controls cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state or foreign laws and regulations, and actions by regulatory authorities or changes in applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.        Our activities are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union and its member states, and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. Indeed, over the last few years, there has been a general increase in focus and developments in these laws and regulations. Compliance with laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include insurance industry regulations, economic and trade sanctions and laws against financial crimes such as money laundering, bribery or other corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In most jurisdictions, governmental and regulatory authorities have the ability to interpret and amend these laws and regulations and impose penalties for non-compliance, including sanctions, civil remedies, fines, injunctions, revocation of licenses or approvals, suspension of individuals, limitations on business activities or redress to clients.     Given the increased interest expressed by US and UK regulators in the effectiveness of compliance controls relating to financial crime in our market sector in particular, we began a voluntary internal review of our policies and controls four years ago. This review includes analysis and advice from external experts on best practices, review of public regulatory decisions, and discussions with government regulators in the US and UK. In addition, the       UK Financial Services Authority conducted an investigation of Willis Limited’s, our UK brokerage subsidiary, compliance systems and controls between 2005 and 2009. On July 21, 2011, we and the FSA announced a settlement under which the FSA concluded its investigation by assessing a £7 million ($11 million) fine on Willis Limited for lapses in its implementation and documentation of its controls to counter the risks of improper payments being made to non-FSA authorized overseas third parties engaged to help win business, particularly in high risk jurisdictions.     As a result of the FSA settlement, we will also be conducting a further internal review of all payments made between 2005 and 2009. We also continue to fully cooperate with our US regulators, however we are unable to predict at this time when our discussions with them will be concluded. We do not believe that this further internal review or our discussions with the US regulators will result in any material fines or sanctions, but there can be no assurance that any resolution will not have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions. While we believe that our current systems and controls are adequate and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure that such systems and controls will prevent any violations of applicable laws and regulations.
