Item 1A —    Risk Factors       Other than as described below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, which are incorporated herein by reference. Copies are available online at http://www.sec.gov or on request from the Company as set forth in Part I, Item 1 “Business-Available Information” in Willis’ Form 10-K.     Risks Related To Our Business     Competitive Risks     We do not control the premiums on which our commissions are based, and volatility or declines in premiums may seriously undermine our profitability.     We derive most of our revenues from commissions and fees for brokerage and consulting services. We do not determine insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. From the late 1980s through late 2000, insurance premium rates generally declined as a result of a number of factors, including the expanded underwriting capacity of insurance carriers; consolidation of both insurance intermediaries and insurance carriers; and increased competition among insurance carriers. During 2004, we saw a rapid transition from a “hard” market, with premium rates stable or increasing, to a “soft” market, with premium rates falling in most markets. Rates continued to decline in most sectors through 2005 and 2006, with the exception of catastrophe-exposed markets. In 2007, the market softened further with decreases in many of the market sectors in which we operated and this continued into 2008 with further premium rate declines averaging 10% across our market sectors. In the nine months ended 2009, the benefit of rate increases in the reinsurance market and stabilization in some specialty markets was more than offset by the continuing soft market in other sectors and the adverse impact of the weakened economic environment across the globe.     In addition, as traditional risk-bearing insurance carriers continue to outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated agents or brokers such as ourselves, those insurance carriers may seek to reduce further their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to those insurance agents or brokers. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may significantly undermine our profitability.     Legal and Regulatory Risks     Our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be materially adversely affected by errors and omissions and the outcome of certain actual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings.     We are subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Because we often assist our clients with matters, including the placement of insurance coverage and the handling of related claims, involving substantial amounts of money, errors and omissions claims against us may arise which allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question.      66    Table of Contents    Claimants can seek large damage awards and these claims can involve potentially significant defense costs. Such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings could, for example, include allegations of damages for our employees or sub-agents improperly failing to place coverage or notify claims on behalf of clients, to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured or to appropriately apply funds that we hold for our clients on a fiduciary basis. Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year and self-insured risks have increased significantly in recent years. In respect of self-insured risks, we have established provisions against these items which we believe to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice, and we adjust such provisions from time to time according to developments. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure. Our ability to obtain professional indemnity insurance in the amounts and with the deductibles we desire in the future may be adversely impacted by general developments in the market for such insurance or our own claims experience. In addition, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.     The principal actual or potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings to which we are currently subject, including but not limited to errors and omissions claims, are: (1) the regulatory and other proceedings relating to among other things contingent compensation arrangements referred to above; (2) potential claims arising out of various legal proceedings between reinsurers, reinsureds and their reinsurance brokers relating to personal accident excess of loss reinsurance placements for the years 1993 to 1998; (3) potential damages arising out of a court action, on behalf of a purported class of present and former female officer and officer equivalent employees for alleged discrimination against them on the basis of their gender; (4) claims with respect to our placement of property and casualty insurance for a number of entities which were directly impacted by the September 11, 2001 destruction of New York’s World Trade Center complex; and (5) claims relating to the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group, for which we acted as brokers of record on certain lines of insurance.     The ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us. It is thus possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters. In addition, even if we do not experience significant monetary costs, there may be adverse publicity associated with these matters that will result in reputational harm to the insurance brokerage industry in general or to us in particular that may adversely affect our business.     Financial Risks     Our incurrence of additional debt to pay a portion of the consideration related to the HRH acquisition, to repurchase a portion of our 5.125% senior notes due 2010, and for general corporate purposes significantly increased our interest expense, financial leverage and debt service requirements.     In October 2008, in connection with the acquisition of HRH, we incurred incremental borrowings of $1.525 billion which significantly increased our leverage. These borrowings were drawn down under new credit facilities consisting of a $700 million 5-year term loan facility, a $300 million revolving credit facility and a $1 billion interim credit facility. In February 2009, we entered into an agreement with Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to issue notes in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million. We used the net proceeds of this issuance of approximately $480 million towards the balance of the interim credit facility and subsequently repaid the remainder of the interim facility out of cash flow from operations. The issuance of the notes resulted in a significant increase in our interest expense compared to that under the interim credit facility.     On September 29, 2009 we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 7.0% senior notes due 2019. We used a portion of the proceeds to repurchase approximately $160 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.125% senior notes due 2010 and the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes.     67    Table of Contents    Although management believes that our cash flows will be more than adequate to service this debt, there may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on this new debt could adversely affect our cash flows and this level of indebtedness may:           •   require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, to pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;       •   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates if the borrowings bear interest at variable rates;       •   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes or challenges relating to our business and industry; and       •   put us at a competitive disadvantage against competitors who have less indebtedness or are in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources.       The terms of the financing also include certain limitations on the amount and type of investments that may be made, the amount of dividends that may be declared, and the amount of shares that may be repurchased. In addition, any borrowings may be made at variable interest rates, making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates generally.     A failure to comply with the restrictions under our credit facilities and outstanding notes could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could cause our obligations with respect to our debt to be accelerated and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.     A downgrade in the credit ratings of our outstanding debt may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility.     As of September 30, 2009, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.6 billion. A downgrade in the credit ratings of our debt would increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility. In addition, certain downgrades would trigger a step-up in interest rates under the indenture for our 6.2% senior notes and our 7.0% senior notes, which would increase our interest expense. If we need to raise capital in the future, any credit rating downgrade could negatively affect our financing costs or access to financing sources.     We have entered into significant put and call arrangements which require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase shares in one of our associates. Those payments would reduce our liquidity and short-term cash flow.     In connection with many of our investments in our associates, we retain rights to increase our ownership percentages over time and, in some cases, the existing owners also have a right to put their shares to us. The put arrangements in place for shares of our associate, Gras Savoye, require us to pay substantial amounts to purchase those shares, which could decrease our liquidity and short-term cash flow.     The rights under the put arrangement may be exercised through 2011. Under the put arrangement, we will be required to buy shares of Gras Savoye increasing our voting rights from the 48 percent we currently hold up to 100 percent if all shareholders put their shares under this arrangement, subject to the pre-emption provisions set out in the bye-laws of Gras Savoye.     Following our initial acquisition of shares, we acquired an additional 5 percent of Gras Savoye at a cost of $25 million under these arrangements in September 2006, another 4 percent at a cost of $31 million in January 2008 and another 5 percent at a cost of $41 million at the end of December 2008. According to the put arrangement, the aggregate management shareholding may not fall below approximately 10% of Gras Savoye’s share capital while the management shareholders remain general partners of Gras Savoye. The current appointments of the relevant individuals will expire on December 31, 2009. Accordingly (and except      68    Table of Contents    in case of death, disability or retirement prior to such date), management shareholders will not have a general put right until January 1, 2010. Payments in connection with management put rights would not have exceeded $67 million if those rights had been fully exercised at December 31, 2008. In addition, we have a call option to move to majority ownership under certain circumstances and in any event from December 2009. Once we exercise this call option, the remaining Gras Savoye shareholders will have a put option to require us to purchase their shares.     Subject to the pre-emption provisions set out in the bye-laws of Gras Savoye, the incremental 42 percent of Gras Savoye shares held by shareholders (excluding the 10 percent holding of management shareholders described above) may be put to us at a price determined by a contractual formula based on earnings and revenue, which at December 31, 2008 would have amounted to approximately $285 million. The shareholders may put their shares individually at any time during the put period and the amounts we may have to pay in connection with the put arrangements may significantly exceed this estimate. In each case, we would have 90 days from the date of a notification from a shareholder who wished to put his shares to us to acquire those shares. The timing of any exercise of these put and call arrangements could have a material affect on our results of operations or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period.     We have recently disclosed that we are in an exclusive arrangement with Astorg Partners to sell a portion of our interest in Gras Savoye pursuant to which we expect to eliminate the put option presently exercisable by the Gras Savoye shareholders. However, no definitive agreement with respect to any sale has been entered into by the parties. In addition, we have stated that we do not expect the other Gras Savoye shareholders to exercise their put options within the next twelve months. As a result of the significant uncertainties underlying these forward-looking statements, our inclusion of this information is not a representation and there is no guarantee that our objectives, plans or statements will be achieved.     Reorganization Risks     For purposes of these risk factors, “Transaction” refers to the transaction under the Reorganization whereby the common shares of Willis-Bermuda will be cancelled and shareholders will receive, on a one-for-one basis, new ordinary shares of Willis-Ireland. The Transaction will be effected by a scheme of arrangement under Bermuda law (the “Scheme of Arrangement”). References to the Reorganization include the Transaction and other related transactions as described in our Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A for a special court-ordered meeting regarding the proposed Transaction filed with the SEC on November 2, 2009 (the “Transaction Proxy Statement”).     Your rights as a shareholder will change as a result of the Transaction.     Because of differences between Irish law and Bermuda law and differences between the governing documents of Willis-Ireland and Willis-Bermuda, your rights as a shareholder will change if the Transaction is completed. For a description of these differences, please see the comparison chart of your rights as a common shareholder of Willis-Bermuda against your rights as an ordinary shareholder of Willis-Ireland, located in “Comparison of Rights of Shareholders and Powers of the Board of Directors” in the Transaction Proxy Statement.     Our effective tax rate may increase whether we effect the Reorganization or not.     While the Reorganization is not anticipated to have any material impact on our effective tax rate, there is uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate (which include the potential legislative actions described below), and our effective tax rate may increase and any such increase may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of Ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective tax rate.     Legislative and regulatory action could materially and adversely affect us.     If the Transaction is not completed, our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority following the Transaction. For example, legislative action may be taken by the U.S. Congress which, if ultimately enacted,      69    Table of Contents    could override tax treaties upon which we rely or could broaden the circumstances under which we would be considered a U.S. resident regardless of whether we complete the Transaction, each of which could materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate and cash tax position. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals. However, if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding all or some of the Transaction or limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions (including the U.S.), we could be subjected to increased taxation. In addition, any future amendments to the current income tax treaties between Ireland and other jurisdictions could subject us to increased taxation.     As an Irish company following the Transaction, we will be required to comply with numerous Irish and EU legal requirements. Compliance with Irish and EU laws and regulations may incur additional costs and have a material and adverse effect on Willis’ financial condition and results of operations.     There continues to be negative publicity regarding, and criticism of, companies that conduct business in the U.S. and in other countries but are domiciled in countries that do not have a substantial network of commercial, tax and other treaties and trade agreements. We may become subject to criticism in connection with our proposed move to Ireland.     The Transaction will result in additional direct and indirect costs, even if it is not completed.     We will incur additional costs as a result of the Transaction, although we do not expect these costs to be material. Willis-Ireland has been incorporated in Ireland and is subject to Irish law. Our intention is that we will hold all of our regularly scheduled board of directors meetings and annual general meetings of shareholders in Ireland. We also expect to incur costs and expenses, including professional fees, to comply with Irish corporate and tax laws and financial reporting requirements. In addition, we expect to incur attorneys’ fees, accountants’ fees, filing fees, mailing expenses and financial printing expenses in connection with the Transaction, even if the Scheme of Arrangement is not approved or completed. The Transaction also may negatively affect us by diverting attention of our management and employees from our operating business during the period of implementation and by increasing other administrative costs and expenses.     We cannot guarantee that changes would not be made to the terms of our indentures in connection with obtaining the supplemental indentures required or necessary for the Reorganization.     We expect to seek consents or waivers and/or enter into supplemental indentures with respect to our existing indentures under which Willis-Ireland and/or certain of its subsidiaries will guarantee the obligations of the issuers of our notes and assume the obligations of a parent entity under the indentures. One of the conditions to consummation of the Transaction is that Willis-Ireland enter into the supplemental indentures on terms acceptable to us, although we may waive this condition. Please see “Proposal Number One: The Transaction — Conditions to Consummation of the Transaction” in the Transaction Proxy Statement. Although we expect that no material change would be made to the terms of our indentures in connection with obtaining the supplemental indentures, we cannot guarantee that there would not be any such material change. Please see “Proposal Number One: The Transaction — Supplemental Indentures” in the Transaction Proxy Statement.     We may choose to abandon or delay the Transaction.     We may abandon or delay the Transaction at any time prior to the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective by action of our board of directors, even after the special court-ordered meeting and the sanction of the Supreme Court of Bermuda. While we currently expect to complete the Transaction as soon as practicable after obtaining shareholder approval of the Scheme of Arrangement at the meeting, our board of directors may delay the Transaction for a significant time or may abandon the Transaction after the meeting because, among other reasons, the Transaction is no longer in our best interest or the best interests of our shareholders or may not result in the benefits we expect, or our estimated cost of the Transaction increases. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain the requisite shareholder or court approvals. Please see “Proposal Number One: The Transaction — Amendment, Termination or Delay” in the Transaction Proxy Statement.     70    Table of Contents    If the common shareholders of Willis-Bermuda do not approve the distributable reserves proposal, Willis-Ireland may not be able to pay dividends or repurchase shares following the Transaction. In addition, there is no guarantee that Irish High Court approval of the creation of distributable reserves will be forthcoming.     Under Irish law, dividends must be paid and share repurchases must generally be funded out of “distributable reserves,” which Willis-Ireland will not have immediately following the Transaction Time. Please see “Description of Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company Share Capital — Dividends” and “— Share Repurchases, Redemptions and Conversions” in the Transaction Proxy Statement. If the Scheme of Arrangement is approved, the common shareholders of Willis-Bermuda will also be asked at the special court-ordered meeting to approve the creation of distributable reserves of Willis-Ireland (through the reduction of the entire share premium account of Willis-Ireland or such lessor amount as may be determined by the board of directors of Willis-Ireland), in order to permit us to continue to pay quarterly dividends and repurchase shares following the Transaction. Approval of the distributable reserves proposal is not a condition to the Transaction, but is required under Irish law to continue our existing dividend payments. Accordingly, if the common shareholders of Willis-Bermuda approve the Scheme of Arrangement but do not approve the distributable reserves proposal, and the Transaction is consummated, Willis-Ireland may not have sufficient distributable reserves to pay dividends or to repurchase shares following the Transaction.     In addition, the creation of distributable reserves requires the approval of the Irish High Court. Although we are not aware of any reason why the Irish High Court would not approve the creation of distributable reserves, the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the Irish High Court and there is no guarantee that such approval will be forthcoming. Even if the Irish High Court does approve the creation of distributable reserves, it may take substantially longer than we anticipate and the Irish High Court may not approve the reduction of the entire share premium amount of Willis-Ireland. Please see “Proposal Number Two: Creation of Distributable Reserves” in the Transaction Proxy Statement.     As a result of different shareholder voting requirements in Ireland relative to Bermuda, we will have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management than we now have.     Under Bermuda law, our directors may issue, without shareholder approval, any common shares authorized in our memorandum of association that are not already issued. Irish law allows shareholders to authorize a board of directors to subsequently issue shares without shareholder approval for a period of five years. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory pre-emption rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash, but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of such statutory pre-emption rights. In advance of the Transaction, the current shareholders of Willis-Ireland will have provided such authority to issue shares and waived these statutory pre-emption rights for a period of five years in each case. These authorizations must be renewed by the shareholders every five years and we cannot guarantee that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our debt securities. As a result of these Irish law requirements, situations may arise where the flexibility we now have in Bermuda would have provided benefits to our shareholders that will not be available in Ireland.     As a result of different shareholder voting requirements in Ireland relative to Bermuda, we will have less flexibility with respect to our ability to amend our constituent documents than we now have.     Under Bermuda law and our current bye-laws, our bye-laws may be amended by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares, except for certain enumerated provisions. Irish law requires a special resolution of 75% of the shareholder votes cast at a general meeting for any amendment to the articles of association of Willis-Ireland. As a result of this Irish law requirement, situations may arise where the flexibility we now have in Bermuda would have provided benefits to our shareholders that will not be available in Ireland. Please see “Comparison of Rights of Shareholders and Powers of the Board of Directors — Amendment of Governing Documents” in the Transaction Proxy Statement.     71    Table of Contents    After the Transaction, attempted takeovers of Willis-Ireland will be subject to the Irish Takeover Rules and subject to review by the Irish Takeover Panel.     We will become subject to the Irish Takeover Rules, under which the board of directors of Willis-Ireland will not be permitted to take any action which might frustrate an offer for Willis-Ireland ordinary shares once the board of directors has received an approach which may lead to an offer or has reason to believe an offer is imminent. Further, it could be more difficult for Willis-Ireland to obtain shareholder approval for a merger or negotiated transaction after the Transaction because the shareholder approval requirements for certain types of transactions differ, and in some cases are greater, under Irish law than under Bermuda law. Please see “Comparison of Rights of Shareholders and Powers of the Board of Directors — Capitalization,” “— Pre-emption Rights, Share Warrants and Share Options” and “— Distributions and Dividends; Repurchases and Redemptions” in the Transaction Proxy Statement.     After the Transaction, a future transfer of your Willis-Ireland ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty.     In certain circumstances, the transfer of shares in an Irish incorporated company will be subject to Irish stamp duty which is a legal obligation of the buyer. This duty is currently at the rate of 1% of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired, if higher. However, transfers of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) representing Willis-Ireland shares should not be subject to Irish stamp duty. Accordingly, transfers by shareholders who hold their Willis-Ireland ordinary shares beneficially through brokers which in turn hold those shares through DTC, should not be subject to Irish stamp duty on transfers to holders who also hold through DTC. This exemption is available because our shares are traded on a recognized stock exchange in the U.S. Any transfer of Willis-Ireland ordinary shares which is subject to Irish stamp duty will not be registered in the name of the buyer unless an instrument of transfer is executed by or on behalf of the seller, is duly stamped and is provided to our transfer agent. Although in the majority of transactions there should be no stamp duty because the transaction is effected by transfer of book-entry interest through DTC, this additional risk for the buyer could adversely affect the price of our shares.     Any transfer of Willis-Ireland shares that is subject to Irish stamp duty will not be registered in the name of the buyer unless an instrument of transfer is duly stamped and provided to our transfer agent. Willis-Ireland’s articles of association allow Willis-Ireland, in its absolute discretion, to create an instrument of transfer and pay (or procure the payment of) any stamp duty payable by a buyer. In the event of any such payment, Willis-Ireland is (on behalf of itself or its affiliates) entitled to (i) seek reimbursement from the buyer or seller (at its discretion), (ii) set-off the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends payable to the buyer or seller (at its discretion), and (iii) claim a lien against the Willis-Ireland shares on which it has paid stamp duty. Parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in Willis-Ireland shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us.     After the Transaction, dividends received by you may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.     In certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, Willis-Ireland may be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 20%) from dividends paid to its shareholders. Shareholders resident in “relevant territories” (including countries that are EU member states (other than Ireland), the U.S. and other countries with which Ireland has signed a tax treaty whether that treaty has been ratified or not) should not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that, in each case, they complete certain tax forms. However, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of Willis-Ireland’s shares. Please see “Material Tax Considerations — Irish Tax Considerations — Withholding Tax on Dividends” in the Transaction Proxy Statement.     After the Transaction, dividends received by you could be subject to Irish income tax.     Dividends paid in respect of Willis-Ireland shares will generally not be subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Willis-Ireland. Willis-      72    Table of Contents    Ireland shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividend unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Willis-Ireland. Please see “Material Tax Considerations — Irish Tax Considerations — Income Tax on Dividends Paid on Willis Shares” in the Transaction Proxy Statement.     Willis recommends that each shareholder consult his or her own tax advisor as to the tax consequences of holding shares in and receiving dividends from Willis.     The market for the Willis-Ireland shares may differ from the market for the Willis-Bermuda shares.     We intend to list the Willis-Ireland ordinary shares on the NYSE under the symbol “WSH,” the same trading symbol as the Willis-Bermuda common shares. The market price, trading volume or volatility of the Willis-Ireland ordinary shares could be different than those of the Willis-Bermuda shares.           Item 2 —    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
