See Note 3 — Merger for additional information pertaining to this transaction.Willis Towers Watson is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. The Company has more than 41,000 employees and services clients in more than 140 countries and territories. We offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks, and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and engage a talented workforce. Our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting), as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services, technology and solutions that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals. As an insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We operate the largest private Medicare exchange in the United States (‘U.S.’). Through this exchange and those for active employees, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits. We are not an insurance company, and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.We believe our broad perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance. Note 2 — Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements Basis of PresentationThe accompanying unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements of Willis Towers Watson and our subsidiaries are presented in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and therefore do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (‘GAAP’). We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation due to the adoption of certain updated accounting standards (see below for further discussion). In the opinion of management, these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements and results for the interim periods. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read together with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017, and may be accessed via EDGAR on the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the entire year. The Company experiences seasonal fluctuations of its commissions and fees revenue. Commissions and fees are typically higher during the Company’s first and fourth quarters due to the timing of broking-related activities. The results reflect certain estimates and assumptions made by management, including those estimates used in calculating acquisition consideration and fair value of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, professional liability claims, estimated bonuses, valuation of billed and unbilled receivables, and anticipated tax liabilities that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.10Recent Accounting PronouncementsNot yet adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (‘FASB’) issued Accounting Standard Update (‘ASU’) No. 2014-09, Revenue From Contracts With Customers. The new standard supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance and eliminates industry-specific guidance. The ASU is based on the principle that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the new standard. Additional ASUs have since been issued which provide additional guidance, examples and technical corrections for the implementation of ASU No. 2014-09. The guidance is effective for the Company at the beginning of its 2018 fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. While we are still in the process of analyzing our various revenue streams to determine the full impact this standard will have on our revenue recognition, cost deferral, systems and processes, the Company has determined the following: •The Company will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach on January 1, 2018. •We expect certain revenue streams to have accelerated revenue recognition timing. In particular, the revenue recognition for our Retiree Medicare Exchange is expected to move from monthly ratable recognition over the policy period, to the recognition upon placement of the policy during the Company’s fourth quarter of the preceding calendar year in the amount of one year of expected commissions. Therefore, upon adoption, we will reflect an adjustment to retained earnings for the revenue that would otherwise have been recognized during our 2018 calendar year since our earnings process will have been completed during the fourth quarter of 2017. •We expect our accounting for deferred costs will change. First, for those portions of the business that currently defer costs (related to system implementation activities), the length of time over which we amortize those costs is expected to extend to a longer estimated contract term. Currently these costs are amortized over a typical period of 3-5 years in accordance with the initial stated terms of the customer agreement. Second, we believe there will be other types of arrangements with associated costs that do not meet the criteria for cost deferral under current U.S. GAAP but do meet the criteria under the new standard. We are still evaluating the types of arrangements that might now have cost deferral impacts, however we expect this guidance to apply to our broking arrangements and certain consulting engagements. To prepare for the additional disclosure requirements, we are currently implementing additional tools to support our revenue recognition and data collection processes, which will be in place and effective on January 1, 2018.The Company continues to update its assessment of the impacts of the accounting standard, and related updates, to its condensed consolidated financial statements, and will note material impacts when known. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which requires a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The ASU becomes effective for the Company at the beginning of its 2019 fiscal year, at which time the Company will adopt it, although early adoption is permitted. In transition, the Company is required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients. While the Company continues to assess the impact of the ASU to its condensed consolidated financial statements, the majority of its leases are currently considered operating leases and will be capitalized as a lease asset on its balance sheet with a related lease liability for the obligated lease payments.In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which amends guidance on presentation and classification of eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. The ASU becomes effective for the Company at the beginning of its 2018 fiscal year, at which time the Company will adopt it, although early adoption is permitted. Any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is still assessing the impact of this ASU, but it believes the impact on its financial statements will be immaterial as it is currently largely in compliance with its requirements.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, current U.S. GAAP requires the performance of procedures to determine the fair value at the 11impairment testing date of assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, the amendments under this ASU require the goodwill impairment test to be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017, and the Company is still evaluating when to adopt this ASU. The Company does not expect an immediate impact to its condensed consolidated financial statements upon adopting this ASU since the most recent Step 1 goodwill impairment test resulted in fair values in excess of carrying values for all reporting units at October 1, 2016.In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which requires entities to (1) disaggregate the current service-cost component from the other components of net benefit cost (the ‘other components’) and present it in the income statement with other current compensation costs for related employees and (2) present the other components elsewhere in the income statement and outside of income from operations if that subtotal is presented. In addition, the ASU requires entities to disclose the income statement lines that contain the other components if they are not presented or included in appropriately described separate lines. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, and should be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a financial year. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018, and is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Stock Compensation - Scope of Modification Accounting, which provides guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The ASU requires that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if used), vesting conditions and classification (as equity or liability) of the modified award are all the same as for the original award immediately before the modification. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, and should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018, and is currently assessing the impact that this standard will have on any awards that are modified once this standard is adopted.In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which provides amendments under six specific objectives to better align risk management activities and financial reporting, and to simplify disclosure, presentation, hedging and the testing and measurement of ineffectiveness. The ASU becomes effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, and any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently assessing when it will adopt this standard, and the impact that this standard will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.Adopted In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. In accordance with the prospective adoption of the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, we recognized a $3 million and $5 million tax benefit in provision for income taxes during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. In addition, we elected to prospectively adopt the amendment to present excess tax benefits on share-based compensation as an operating activity, resulting in the recognition of a $5 million excess tax benefit as an operating activity in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. We elected to continue to estimate expected forfeitures. We also retrospectively adopted the amendment to present cash payments to tax authorities in connection with shares withheld to meet statutory tax withholding requirements as a financing activity. As a result, this $13 million use of cash was reclassified from net cash from operating activities to net cash used in financing activities in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Accounting for Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Asset Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory, which amends guidance regarding the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for intra-entity asset transfers. Current U.S. GAAP prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset has been sold to an outside party. The ASU states that an entity should recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of 12the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company elected to early adopt this standard on January 1, 2017, and recorded a cumulative reduction to retained earnings of $3 million.Note 3 — Merger On January 4, 2016, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated June 29, 2015, as amended on November 19, 2015, between Willis, Towers Watson, and Citadel Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis formed for the purpose of facilitating this transaction (‘Merger Sub’), Merger Sub merged with and into Towers Watson, with Towers Watson continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis. At the effective time of the Merger (the ‘Effective Time’), each issued and outstanding share of Towers Watson common stock (the ‘Towers Watson shares’) was converted into the right to receive 2.6490 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable ordinary shares of Willis (the ‘Willis ordinary shares’), $0.000115 nominal value per share, other than any Towers Watson shares owned by Towers Watson, Willis or Merger Sub at the Effective Time and the Towers Watson shares held by stockholders who are entitled to, and who properly exercised, dissenter’s rights under Delaware law. Immediately following the Merger, Willis effected (i) a consolidation (i.e., a reverse stock split under Irish law) of Willis ordinary shares whereby every 2.6490 Willis ordinary shares were consolidated into one Willis ordinary share ($0.000304635 nominal value per share) and (ii) an amendment to its Constitution and other organizational documents to change its name from Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company to Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company. On December 29, 2015, the third business day immediately prior to the closing date of the Merger, Towers Watson declared and paid a pre-merger special dividend of $10.00 per share of its common stock, and approximately $694 million in the aggregate based on approximately 69 million Towers Watson shares issued and outstanding at December 29, 2015.On December 30, 2015, all Towers Watson treasury stock was canceled.The Merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, with Willis considered the accounting acquirer of Towers Watson. The table below presents the final calculation of aggregate Merger consideration.

See Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies for a discussion of our material acquired contingencies related to Legacy Towers Watson. iii.Represents both debt due upon change of control of $400 million borrowed under Towers Watson’s term loan ($188 million) and revolving credit facility ($212 million) and a draw down under a new term loan of $340 million. The $400 million debt was repaid by Willis borrowings under the 1-year term loan facility on January 4, 2016. The $340 million new term loan partially funded the $694 million Towers Watson pre-merger special dividend. The purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. The purchase price allocation was complete as of December 31, 2016. Goodwill is calculated as the difference between aggregate Merger consideration and the acquisition date fair value of the net assets acquired, and represents the value of the Legacy Towers Watson assembled workforce and the future economic benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the Merger. None of the goodwill recognized on the transaction is tax deductible. The acquired intangible assets are attributable to the following categories: Amortization basis Fair Value Expected life (years)Customer relationshipsIn line with underlying cash flows $2,221 15.0Software - income approachIn line with underlying cash flows or straight-line basis 567 6.4Software - cost approachStraight-line basis 108 4.9ProductIn line with underlying cash flows 42 17.5IPR&D (i)n/a 39 n/aTrade nameStraight-line basis 1,003 25.0Favorable lease agreementsStraight-line basis 11 6.5   $3,991  ____________________i.Represents individual in-process research and development (‘IPR&D’) software components not placed into service as of the acquisition date. These assets were subsequently placed into service during the three months ended March 31, 2017, were reclassified into finite-lived software intangible assets, and are being amortized in line with underlying cash flows or on a straight-line basis. 14Acquired Share-Based Compensation PlansIn connection with the Merger, we assumed certain stock options and restricted stock units (‘RSUs’) issued under the Towers Watson & Co. 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), the Liazon Corporation 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, and the Extend Health, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. Stock Options. The outstanding unvested employee stock options were converted into 592,486 Willis Towers Watson stock options using the conversion ratios stated in the Merger agreement for the number of options. The fair value of the stock options was calculated using the Black-Scholes model with a volatility and risk-free interest rate over the expected term of each group of options and Willis Towers Watson’s closing share price on the date of acquisition. We determined the fair value of the portion of the outstanding options related to pre-acquisition employee service using the straight-line expense methodology from the date of grant to the acquisition date to be $7 million, which was added to the transaction consideration. The fair value of the remaining portion of options related to the post-acquisition employee services was $13 million, and will be recognized over the future vesting periods. Restricted Stock Units. The outstanding unvested RSUs were converted into 597,307 Willis Towers Watson RSUs using the conversion ratios as stated in the Merger agreement. The fair value of these RSUs was calculated using Willis Towers Watson’s closing share price on the date of acquisition. We determined the fair value of the portion of the outstanding RSUs related to pre-acquisition employee service using the straight-line expense methodology from the date of grant to the acquisition date to be $30 million, which was added to the transaction consideration. The fair value of the remaining portion of RSUs related to the post-acquisition employee services was $32 million, and will be recognized over the future vesting periods.Note 4 — Segment Information Willis Towers Watson has four reportable operating segments or business areas:•Human Capital and Benefits (‘HCB’)•Corporate Risk and Broking (‘CRB’) •Investment, Risk and Reinsurance (‘IRR’) •Benefits Delivery and Administration (‘BDA’) - formerly known as Exchange Solutions (i) ____________________i.This segment and the businesses within the segment were renamed to better reflect the nature of the services we offer.Willis Towers Watson’s chief operating decision maker is its chief executive officer. We determined that the operational data used by the chief operating decision maker is at the segment level. Management bases strategic goals and decisions on these segments and the data presented below is used to assess the adequacy of strategic decisions, the method of achieving these strategies and related financial results. The Company experiences seasonal fluctuations of its commissions and fees revenue. Revenue is typically higher during the Company’s first and fourth quarters due to timing of broking-related activities.Beginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the following: •First, to better align our business within our segments, we moved Max Matthiessen, which specializes in pension investment advice, to Investment, Risk and Reinsurance from Human Capital and Benefits; and moved Fine Art, Jewellery and Specie, which is a specialty broker, to Corporate Risk and Broking from Investment, Risk and Reinsurance. •Second, we recast operating income to better reflect the new segment reporting basis. As part of the further integration of our Willis Towers Watson businesses, we updated our corporate expense allocations to standardize our methodologies and allocate those expenses which are directly related to the business segment operations. Additionally, we revised the presentation of certain adjustments which arose from the purchase accounting for the Merger. Due to the long-term nature of these adjustments, which impact fixed asset and internally-developed software, we aligned the presentation within the respective segments and consolidated operating income, thereby eliminating a reconciling adjustment.The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation.15The following table presents segment commissions and fees, segment interest and other income, segment revenues, and segment operating income for our reportable segments for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.

The main elements of the program, which will be completed by the end of 2017, include: moving more than 3,500 support roles from higher cost locations to facilities in lower cost locations; net workforce reductions in support positions; lease consolidation in real estate; and information technology systems simplification and rationalization.The Company recognized restructuring costs of $31 million and $85 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, and $36 million and $98 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, related to the Operational Improvement Program. The Company expects to incur $130 million of restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program during fiscal year 2017, bringing the cumulative restructuring charges for this program to approximately $440 million. Business Restructure Program - In the second quarter of 2016, we began planning targeted staffing reductions in certain portions of the business due to a reduction in business demand or change in business focus (hereinafter referred to as the Business Restructure Program). The main element of the program included workforce reductions, and was completed in 2016.The Company recognized $13 million and $17 million of restructuring costs related to the Business Restructure Program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 17An analysis of total restructuring costs recognized in the statements of comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 by segment is as follows:  Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 HCB CRB IRR BDA Corporate TotalTermination benefits$— $5 $— $— $1 $6Professional services and other1 20 2 — 2 25Total$1 $25 $2 $— $3 $31             Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 HCB CRB IRR BDA Corporate TotalTermination benefits$12 $3 $— $— $1 $16Professional services and other— 23 1 — 9 33Total$12 $26 $1 $— $10 $49             Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 HCB CRB IRR BDA Corporate TotalTermination benefits$— $14 $3 $— $2 $19Professional services and other2 50 4 — 10 66Total$2 $64 $7 $— $12 $85             Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 HCB CRB IRR BDA Corporate TotalTermination benefits$14 $11 $3 $— $2 $30Professional services and other— 60 2 — 23 85Total$14 $71 $5 $— $25 $115            18An analysis of the total cumulative restructuring costs recognized for the Operational Improvement Program from its commencement to September 30, 2017 by segment is as follows: HCB CRB IRR BDA Corporate Total2014           Termination benefits$— $15 $1 $— $— $16Professional services and other (i)— 3 — — 17 202015           Termination benefits2 24 7 — 3 36Professional services and other (i)1 57 2 — 30 902016           Termination benefits1 18 3 — 1 23Professional services and other (i)1 81 4 — 36 1222017           Termination benefits— 14 3 — 2 19Professional services and other (i)2 50 4 — 10 66Total           Termination benefits3 71 14 — 6 94Professional services and other (i)4 191 10 — 93 298Total$7 $262 $24 $— $99 $392____________________i.Other includes salaries and benefits, premises, and other expenses incurred to support the ongoing management and facilitation of the program.

The effective tax rate was (53.0)% and 17.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, and 45.9% and 3.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. These effective tax rates are calculated using extended values from our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and are therefore more precise tax rates than can be calculated from rounded values. Our effective tax rate is generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. This is primarily due to our global mix of income which creates deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates. The (53.0)% effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was the result of a discrete income tax charge for an internal reorganization. The increase in tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to an internal restructuring for certain legacy Towers Watson businesses. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a current year U.S. tax expense resulting from internal reorganizations for certain legacy Towers Watson businesses, and a prior year tax benefit resulting from an enacted statutory tax rate reduction in the U.K.Historically, we have not provided deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of our subsidiaries that have been reinvested indefinitely. As a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired Towers Watson foreign operations, we continue to accrue deferred taxes on current year earnings of those subsidiaries. However, we assert that the historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries are reinvested indefinitely, and therefore do not provide deferred tax liabilities on these amounts.The Company records valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets based on whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions under Accounting Standards Codification (‘ASC’) 740, Income Taxes of $57 million, excluding interest and penalties. The Company believes the outcomes that are reasonably possible within the next 12 months may result in a reduction in the liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately $4 million to $7 million, excluding interest and penalties. Note 7 — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair market value of identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units primarily based on the original purchase price allocation for acquisitions within the reporting units, or relative fair value when an acquisition covers multiple reporting units. When a business entity is sold, goodwill is allocated to the disposed entity based on the relative fair value of that entity compared with the fair value of the reporting unit in which it was included. 20The components of goodwill are outlined below for the nine months ended September 30, 2017: HCB CRB IRR BDA TotalBalance at December 31, 2016:         Goodwill, gross$4,412 $2,178 $1,758 $2,557 $10,905Accumulated impairment losses(130) (362) — — (492)Goodwill, net - December 31, 20164,282 1,816 1,758 2,557 10,413Goodwill reassigned in segment realignment(i)(113) 13 100 — —Goodwill acquired during the period— 8 — — 8Goodwill disposed of during the period(31) — — — (31)Foreign exchange64 57 18 — 139Balance at September 30, 2017:    Goodwill, gross4,332 2,256 1,876 2,557 11,021Accumulated impairment losses(130) (362) — — (492)Goodwill, net - September 30, 2017$4,202 $1,894 $1,876 $2,557 $10,529____________________i.Represents the preliminary reallocation of goodwill related to certain businesses which were realigned among the segments as of January 1, 2017.

Our acquired unfavorable lease liabilities were $27 million and $29 million at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and are recorded in other non-current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.21The following table reflects the carrying value of finite-lived intangible assets and liabilities at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016: September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated AmortizationClient relationships$3,476 $(1,030) $3,396 $(741)Management contracts69 (11) 62 (8)Software762 (254) 711 (141)Trademark and trade name1,054 (78) 1,051 (45)Product38 (5) 36 (3)Favorable agreements14 (3) 13 (2)Other5 (3) 6 (3)Total finite-lived assets$5,418 $(1,384) $5,275 $(943)        Unfavorable agreements$34 $(7) $34 $(5)Total finite-lived intangible liabilities$34 $(7) $34 $(5)The weighted average remaining life of amortizable intangible assets and liabilities at September 30, 2017 was 14.5 years.

Where possible, we identify exposures in our business that can be offset internally. Where no natural offset is identified, we may choose to enter into various derivative transactions. These instruments have the effect of reducing our exposure to unfavorable changes in interest and foreign currency rates. The Company’s board of directors reviews and approves policies for managing each of these risks as summarized below.Interest Rate Risk - Investment IncomeAs a result of the Company’s operating activities, the Company holds fiduciary funds. The Company earns interest on these funds, which is included in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements in interest and other income. These funds are regulated in terms of access as are the instruments in which they may be invested, most of which are short-term in nature.During 2015, in order to manage interest rate risk arising from these financial assets, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest. These derivatives, with total notional amounts of $300 million, were designated as hedging instruments at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and had net fair value liabilities of $1 million and nil, respectively.Foreign Currency RiskCertain non-U.S. subsidiaries receive revenues and incur expenses in currencies other than their functional currency and as a result, the foreign subsidiary’s functional currency revenues will fluctuate as the currency rates change. Additionally, the forecast Pounds sterling expenses of our London brokerage market operations may exceed their Pounds sterling revenues, and 22they may also hold a significant net Pounds sterling asset or liability position in the consolidated balance sheet. To reduce such variability, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against this currency risk.These derivatives were designated as hedging instruments and at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 had total notional amounts of $776 million and $945 million, respectively, and net fair value liabilities of $34 million and $110 million, respectively.At September 30, 2017, the Company estimates, based on current interest and exchange rates, there will be $33 million of net derivative losses on forward exchange rates, interest rate swaps, and treasury locks reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) into earnings within the next twelve months as the forecast transactions affect earnings. At September 30, 2017, our longest outstanding maturity was 2.7 years.The effects of the material derivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:Three Months Ended September 30,Gain/(loss) recognized in OCI (effective portion) Location of loss reclassified from Accumulated OCI into income (effective element)  Loss reclassified from Accumulated OCI into income(effective element)  Location of gain/(loss) recognized in income (ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing) Gain/(loss) recognized in income (ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing) 2017 2016   2017 2016   2017 2016Forward exchange contracts$12 $(6) Other expense, net $(10) $(14) Interest expense $— $—Nine Months Ended September 30,Gain/(loss) recognized in OCI (effective portion) Location of loss reclassified from Accumulated OCI into income (effective element)  Loss reclassified from Accumulated OCI into income(effective element)  Location of gain/(loss) recognized in income (ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing) Gain/(loss) recognized in income (ineffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing) 2017 2016   2017 2016   2017 2016Forward exchange contracts$24 $(81) Other expense, net $(53) $(28) Interest expense $1 $(1)We also enter into foreign currency transactions, primarily to hedge certain intercompany loans. These derivatives are not generally designated as hedging instruments and at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had notional amounts of $569 million and $630 million, respectively, and had net fair value liabilities of $1 million and $8 million, respectively. The effects of derivatives that have not been designated as hedging instruments on the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:    (Loss)/gain recognized in income    Three Months Ended  September 30, Nine Months Ended  September 30,Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Location of (loss)/gain recognized in income 2017 2016 2017 2016Forward exchange contracts Other expense, net $(3) $4 $6 $(6)23Note 9 — Debt Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt consists of the following: September 30, 2017 December 31, 20166.200% senior notes due 2017$— $394Current portion of 7-year term loan facility — 22Current portion of term loan due 201985 85Short-term borrowing under bank overdraft arrangement— 5Other debt — 2 $85 $508Long-term debt consists of the following: September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Revolving $1.25 billion credit facility$917 $—Revolving $800 million credit facility— 2387-year term loan facility — 196Term loan due 2019105 1697.000% senior notes due 2019186 1865.750% senior notes due 2021496 4963.500% senior notes due 2021447 4462.125% senior notes due 2022 (i)635 5654.625% senior notes due 2023248 2473.600% senior notes due 2024645 —4.400% senior notes due 2026543 5436.125% senior notes due 2043271 271 $4,493 $3,357________________________i.Notes issued in Euro (€540 million)Revolving credit facilityOn March 7, 2017, the Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Trinity Acquisition plc (see Note 19 for further information), entered into a $1.25 billion amended and restated revolving credit facility (the ‘RCF’), that will mature on March 7, 2022. The RCF replaced the previous $800 million revolving credit facility. Amounts outstanding under the RCF shall bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.00% to 1.75%, or alternatively, the base rate plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.75%, based upon the Company’s guaranteed senior unsecured long-term debt rating. Borrowings of $409 million and €45 million against the RCF were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the previous $800 million credit facility and the 7-year term loan due July 23, 2018. Additionally, on March 28, 2017, $407 million was used to repay the 6.200% senior notes due 2017, including accrued interest. At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. Senior notes On May 16, 2017, the Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Willis North America Inc. (see Note 17 for further information), completed an offering of $650 million of 3.600% senior notes due 2024 (‘2024 senior notes’). The effective interest rate of the 2024 senior notes is 3.614%, which includes the impact of the discount upon issuance. The 2024 senior notes will mature on May 15, 2024, and interest accrues on the 2024 senior notes from May 16, 2017 and will be paid in cash on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The net proceeds from this offering, after deducting underwriter discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, were $644 million, and were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the RCF and for general corporate purposes. 24 Note 10 — Fair Value Measurements The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value as follows:•Level 1: refers to fair values determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets;•Level 2: refers to fair values estimated using observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data; and•Level 3: includes fair values estimated using unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosure for financial instruments: •Available-for-sale securities are classified as Level 1 because we use quoted market prices in determining the fair value of these securities. •Market values for our derivative instruments have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts based on estimated amounts the Company would receive or have to pay to terminate the agreements, taking into account the current interest rate environment or current foreign currency forward rates. Such financial instruments are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. •Contingent consideration payable is classified as Level 3, and we estimate fair value based on the likelihood and timing of achieving the relevant milestones of each arrangement, applying a probability assessment to each of the potential outcomes, and discounting the probability-weighted payout. Typically, milestones are based on revenue or Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (‘EBITDA’) growth for the acquired business. The following table presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016:  Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis atSeptember 30, 2017 Balance Sheet Location Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:        Available-for-sale securities:        Mutual funds / exchange traded fundsPrepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets$40 $— $— $40Derivatives:        Derivative financial instruments (i)Prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets$— $11 $— $11Liabilities:        Contingent consideration:        Contingent consideration (ii)Other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities$— $— $44 $44Derivatives:        Derivative financial instruments (i)Other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities$— $47 $— $4725  Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis at December 31, 2016 Balance Sheet Location Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:        Available-for-sale securities:    Mutual funds / exchange traded fundsPrepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets$37 $— $— $37Derivatives:        Derivative financial instruments (i)Prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets$— $15 $— $15Liabilities:        Contingent consideration:        Contingent consideration (ii)Other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities$— $— $55 $55Derivatives:        Derivative financial instruments (i)Other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities$— $133 $— $133_________________________i.See Note 8 — Derivative Financial Instruments for further information on our derivative investments.ii.Probability weightings are based on our knowledge of the past and planned performance of the acquired entity to which the contingent consideration applies. The weighted average discount rate used on our material contingent consideration calculations was 9.39% and 10.76% at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Using different probability weightings and discount rates could result in an increase or decrease of the contingent consideration payable. The following table summarizes the change in fair value of the Level 3 liabilities: Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) September 30, 2017Balance at December 31, 2016 $55Obligations assumed —Payments (9)Realized and unrealized losses (6)Foreign exchange  4Balance at September 30, 2017 $44There were no significant transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.The following tables present our liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016: September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair ValueLiabilities:        Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt$85 $85 $508 $513 Long-term debt$4,493 $4,332 $3,357 $3,504The carrying values of our revolving lines of credit and term loans approximate their fair values. The fair values above are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition nor do they indicate the Company’s intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument. The fair value of our respective senior notes are considered level 2 financial instruments as they are corroborated by observable market data. Note 11 — Retirement BenefitsDefined Benefit Plans and Post-retirement Welfare PlanWillis Towers Watson sponsors both qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement welfare plans (‘PRW’) plans throughout the world. The majority of our plan assets and obligations are in the United States and 26the United Kingdom. We have also included disclosures related to defined benefit plans in certain other countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands. Together, these disclosed funded and unfunded plans represent 99% of Willis Towers Watson’s pension and PRW obligations and are disclosed herein. Components of Net Periodic Benefit (Income)/Cost for Defined Benefit Pension and Post-retirement Welfare PlansThe following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit (income)/cost for the Company’s defined benefit pension and PRW plans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 U.S. U.K. Other PRW U.S. U.K. Other PRWService cost$16 $8 $6 $— $15 $6 $5 $—Interest cost34 23 4 1 34 26 6 1Expected return on plan assets(61) (72) (7) — (61) (58) (8) —Settlement1 — — — — — — —Amortization of net loss4 13 — — 3 10 — —Amortization of prior service credit— (4) — — — (5) — —Net periodic benefit (income)/cost$(6) $(32) $3 $1 $(9) $(21) $3 $1 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 U.S. U.K. Other PRW U.S. U.K. Other PRWService cost$49 $23 $15 $— $44 $19 $14 $—Interest cost104 69 13 3 102 83 20 3Expected return on plan assets(184) (211) (22) — (180) (186) (26) —Settlement1 — — — — — 2 —Amortization of net loss10 39 1 — 8 32 1 —Amortization of prior service credit — (13) — — — (15) — —Net periodic benefit (income)/cost$(20) $(93) $7 $3 $(26) $(67) $11 $3Employer Contributions to Defined Benefit Pension PlansThe Company made $50 million contributions to its U.S. plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and anticipates making no further contributions for the remainder of the fiscal year. The Company made contributions of $45 million to its U.K. plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and anticipates making additional contributions of $18 million for the remainder of the fiscal year. The Company made contributions of $11 million to its other plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and anticipates making additional contributions of $4 million for the remainder of the fiscal year.Defined Contribution PlansThe Company made contributions to its defined contribution plans of $39 million and $118 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, and $37 million and $118 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies Indemnification AgreementsWillis Towers Watson has various agreements which provide that it may be obligated to indemnify the other party to the agreement with respect to certain matters. Generally, these indemnification provisions are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business and in connection with the purchase and sale of certain businesses. Although it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments that may become due under these indemnification agreements because of the conditional nature of Willis Towers Watson’s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement, the Company does not believe that any potential liability that might arise from such indemnity provisions is probable or material. There are no provisions for recourse to third parties, nor are any assets held by any third parties that any guarantor can liquidate to recover amounts paid under such indemnities.27Legal ProceedingsIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. Some of the claims, lawsuits and other proceedings seek damages in amounts which could, if assessed, be significant. We do not expect the impact of claims or demands not described below to be material to the Company’s financial statements. The Company also receives subpoenas in the ordinary course of business and, from time to time, receives requests for information in connection with governmental investigations.Errors and omissions claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered in part by professional indemnity or other appropriate insurance. The terms of this insurance vary by policy year. Regarding self-insured risks, the Company has established provisions which are believed to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice, or, in certain cases, where a range of loss exists, the Company accrues the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. The Company adjusts such provisions from time to time according to developments.On the basis of current information, the Company does not expect that the actual claims, lawsuits and other proceedings to which the Company is subject, or potential claims, lawsuits, and other proceedings relating to matters of which it is aware, will ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes with insurance companies, it is possible that an adverse outcome or settlement in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. In addition, given the early stages of some litigation or regulatory proceedings described below, it is not possible to predict their outcome or resolution, and it is possible that these events may have a material adverse effect on the Company.The Company provides for contingent liabilities based on ASC 450, Contingencies, when it is determined that a liability, inclusive of defense costs, is probable and reasonably estimable. The contingent liabilities recorded are primarily developed actuarially. Litigation is subject to many factors which are difficult to predict so there can be no assurance that in the event of a material unfavorable result in one or more claims, we will not incur material costs.Merger-related Appraisal DemandsBetween November 12, 2015 and December 10, 2015, in connection with the then-proposed Merger, Towers Watson received demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law on behalf of ten purported beneficial owners of an aggregate of approximately 2.4% of the shares of Towers Watson common stock outstanding at the time of the Merger. Between March 3, 2016 and March 23, 2016, three appraisal petitions were filed in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware on behalf of three purported beneficial owners of Towers Watson common stock, captioned Rangeley Capital LLC v. Towers Watson & Co., C.A. No. 12063-CB, Merion Capital L.P. v. Towers Watson & Co., C.A. No. 12064-CB, and College Retirement Equities Fund v. Towers Watson & Co., C.A. No. 12126-CB. The appraisal petitions seek, among other things, a determination of the fair value of the appraisal petitioners’ shares at the time of the Merger; an order that Towers Watson pay that value to the appraisal petitioners, together with interest at the statutory rate; and an award of costs, attorneys’ fees, and other expenses. Towers Watson answered the appraisal petitions between March 24, 2016 and April 18, 2016. On May 9, 2016, the court consolidated the three pending appraisal proceedings under the caption In re Appraisal of Towers Watson & Co., Consolidated C.A. No. 12064-CB. A fourth owner filed an appraisal demand, but did not file an appraisal petition. The aggregate amount of shares subject to appraisal from these four owners was 1,415,199. The court provisionally scheduled trial for October 2, 2017. On September 15, 2017, the Company reached a settlement with all shareholders who made demands for appraisal, resolving all claims related to the appraised shares. Under the terms of the settlement, these shareholders surrendered all rights to the Towers Watson shares and all potential Merger consideration issuable for the legacy shares. In exchange, the Company made a payment to these shareholders of approximately $211 million, which represented $134.75 per share plus accrued interest at the statutory rate of interest. As a result of the settlement, the Court, on September 18, 2017, dismissed all claims in the case with prejudice. The Company thereafter canceled all of the Towers Watson common shares at issue in the appraisal proceeding.Stanford Financial Group The Company has been named as a defendant in 15 similar lawsuits relating to the collapse of The Stanford Financial Group (‘Stanford’), for which Willis of Colorado, Inc. acted as broker of record on certain lines of insurance. The complaints in these actions generally allege that the defendants actively and materially aided Stanford’s alleged fraud by providing Stanford with certain letters regarding coverage that they knew would be used to help retain or attract actual or prospective Stanford client investors. The complaints further allege that these letters, which contain statements about Stanford and the insurance policies that the defendants placed for Stanford, contained untruths and omitted material facts and were drafted in this manner to help Stanford promote and sell its allegedly fraudulent certificates of deposit.28The 15 actions are as follows:•Troice, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 3:9-CV-1274-N, was filed on July 2, 2009 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and a Willis associate, among others. On April 1, 2011, plaintiffs filed the operative Third Amended Class Action Complaint individually and on behalf of a putative, worldwide class of Stanford investors, adding Willis Limited as a defendant and alleging claims under Texas statutory and common law and seeking damages in excess of $1 billion, punitive damages and costs. On May 2, 2011, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the Third Amended Class Action Complaint, arguing, inter alia, that the plaintiffs’ claims are precluded by the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (‘SLUSA’). On May 10, 2011, the court presiding over the Stanford-related actions in the Northern District of Texas entered an order providing that it would consider the applicability of SLUSA to the Stanford-related actions based on the decision in a separate Stanford action not involving a Willis entity, Roland v. Green, Civil Action No. 3:10-CV-0224-N (‘Roland’). On August 31, 2011, the court issued its decision in Roland, dismissing that action with prejudice under SLUSA. On October 27, 2011, the court in Troice entered an order (i) dismissing with prejudice those claims asserted in the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on a class basis on the grounds set forth in the Roland decision discussed above and (ii) dismissing without prejudice those claims asserted in the Third Amended Class Action Complaint on an individual basis. Also on October 27, 2011, the court entered a final judgment in the action. On October 28, 2011, the plaintiffs in Troice filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Subsequently, Troice, Roland and a third action captioned Troice, et al. v. Proskauer Rose LLP, Civil Action No. 3:09-CV-01600-N, which also was dismissed on the grounds set forth in the Roland decision discussed above and on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, were consolidated for purposes of briefing and oral argument. Following the completion of briefing and oral argument, on March 19, 2012, the Fifth Circuit reversed and remanded the actions. On April 2, 2012, the defendants-appellees filed petitions for rehearing en banc. On April 19, 2012, the petitions for rehearing en banc were denied. On July 18, 2012, defendants-appellees filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court regarding the Fifth Circuit’s reversal in Troice. On January 18, 2013, the Supreme Court granted our petition. Opening briefs were filed on May 3, 2013 and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on October 7, 2013. On February 26, 2014, the Supreme Court affirmed the Fifth Circuit’s decision. On March 19, 2014, the plaintiffs in Troice filed a Motion to Defer Resolution of Motions to Dismiss, to Compel Rule 26(f) Conference and For Entry of Scheduling Order. On March 25, 2014, the parties in Troice and the Janvey, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al. action discussed below stipulated to the consolidation of the two actions for pre-trial purposes under Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On March 28, 2014, the Court ‘so ordered’ that stipulation and, thus, consolidated Troice and Janvey for pre-trial purposes under Rule 42(a). On September 16, 2014, the court (a) denied the plaintiffs’ request to defer resolution of the defendants’ motions to dismiss, but granted the plaintiffs’ request to enter a scheduling order; (b) requested the submission of supplemental briefing by all parties on the defendants’ motions to dismiss, which the parties submitted on September 30, 2014; and (c) entered an order setting a schedule for briefing and discovery regarding plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which schedule, among other things, provided for the submission of the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification (following the completion of briefing and discovery) on April 20, 2015. On December 15, 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss. On January 30, 2015, the defendants except Willis Group Holdings plc answered the Third Amended Class Action Complaint. On April 20, 2015, the plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification, the defendants filed their opposition to plaintiffs’ motion, and the plaintiffs filed their reply in further support of the motion. Pursuant to an agreed stipulation also filed with the court on April 20, 2015, the defendants on June 4, 2015 filed sur-replies in further opposition to the motion. The Court has not yet scheduled a hearing on the motion. On June 19, 2015, Willis Group Holdings plc filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On November 17, 2015, Willis Group Holdings plc withdrew the motion.On March 31, 2016, the parties in the Troice and Janvey actions entered into a settlement in principle that is described in more detail below. 29•Ranni v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 9-22085, was filed on July 17, 2009 against Willis Group Holdings plc and Willis of Colorado, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The complaint was filed on behalf of a putative class of Venezuelan and other South American Stanford investors and alleges claims under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and Rule 10b-5 thereunder) and Florida statutory and common law and seeks damages in an amount to be determined at trial. On October 6, 2009, Ranni was transferred, for consolidation or coordination with other Stanford-related actions (including Troice), to the Northern District of Texas by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the ‘JPML’). The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in Ranni. On August 26, 2014, the plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the action without prejudice. •Canabal, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 3:9-CV-1474-D, was filed on August 6, 2009 against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate named as a defendant in Troice, among others, also in the Northern District of Texas. The complaint was filed individually and on behalf of a putative class of Venezuelan Stanford investors, alleged claims under Texas statutory and common law and sought damages in excess of $1 billion, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On December 18, 2009, the parties in Troice and Canabal stipulated to the consolidation of those actions (under the Troice civil action number), and, on December 31, 2009, the plaintiffs in Canabal filed a notice of dismissal, dismissing the action without prejudice. •Rupert, et al. v. Winter, et al., Case No. 2009C115137, was filed on September 14, 2009 on behalf of 97 Stanford investors against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate, among others, in Texas state court (Bexar County). The complaint alleges claims under the Securities Act of 1933, Texas and Colorado statutory law and Texas common law and seeks special, consequential and treble damages of more than $300 million, attorneys’ fees and costs. On October 20, 2009, certain defendants, including Willis of Colorado, Inc., (i) removed Rupert to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, (ii) notified the JPML of the pendency of this related action and (iii) moved to stay the action pending a determination by the JPML as to whether it should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas for consolidation or coordination with the other Stanford-related actions. On April 1, 2010, the JPML issued a final transfer order for the transfer of Rupert to the Northern District of Texas. On January 24, 2012, the court remanded Rupert to Texas state court (Bexar County), but stayed the action until further order of the court. On August 13, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay, which motion was denied by the court on September 16, 2014. On October 10, 2014, the plaintiffs appealed the court’s denial of their motion to lift the stay to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. On January 5, 2015, the Fifth Circuit consolidated the appeal with the appeal in the Rishmague, et ano. v. Winter, et al. action discussed below, and the consolidated appeal, was fully briefed as of March 24, 2015. Oral argument on the consolidated appeal was held on September 2, 2015. On September 16, 2015, the Fifth Circuit affirmed. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in Rupert. •Casanova, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 3:10-CV-1862-O, was filed on September 16, 2010 on behalf of seven Stanford investors against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis Limited, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate, among others, also in the Northern District of Texas. The complaint alleges claims under Texas statutory and common law and seeks actual damages in excess of $5 million, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On February 13, 2015, the parties filed an Agreed Motion for Partial Dismissal pursuant to which they agreed to the dismissal of certain claims pursuant to the motion to dismiss decisions in the Troice action discussed above and the Janvey action discussed below. Also on February 13, 2015, the defendants except Willis Group Holdings plc answered the complaint in the Casanova action. On June 19, 2015, Willis Group Holdings plc filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs have not opposed the motion. •Rishmague, et ano. v. Winter, et al., Case No. 2011CI2585, was filed on March 11, 2011 on behalf of two Stanford investors, individually and as representatives of certain trusts, against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis of Colorado, Inc., Willis of Texas, Inc. and the same Willis associate, among others, in Texas state court (Bexar County). The complaint alleges claims under Texas and Colorado statutory law and Texas common law and seeks special, consequential and treble damages of more than $37 million and attorneys’ fees and costs. On April 11, 2011, certain defendants, including Willis of Colorado, Inc., (i) removed Rishmague to the Western District of Texas, (ii) notified the JPML of the pendency of this related action and (iii) moved to stay the action pending a determination by the JPML as to whether it should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas for consolidation or coordination with the other Stanford-related actions. On August 8, 2011, the JPML issued a final transfer order for the transfer of Rishmague to the Northern District of Texas, where it is currently pending. On August 13, 2012, the plaintiffs joined with the plaintiffs in the Rupert action in their motion to lift the court’s stay of the Rupert action. On September 9, 2014, the court remanded Rishmague to Texas state court (Bexar County), but stayed the action until further order of the court and denied the plaintiffs’ motion to lift the stay. On October 10, 2014, the plaintiffs appealed the court’s denial of their motion to lift the stay to the Fifth Circuit. On January 5, 2015, the Fifth Circuit consolidated the appeal with the appeal in the Rupert action, and the consolidated appeal was fully briefed as of March 24, 2015. Oral 30argument on the consolidated appeal was held on September 2, 2015. On September 16, 2015, the Fifth Circuit affirmed.

On June 3, 2013, Willis of Colorado, Inc. removed all five cases to the Southern District of Florida and, on June 4, 2013, notified the JPML of the pendency of these related actions. On June 10, 2013, the court in Tisminesky issued an order sua sponte staying and administratively closing that action pending a determination by the JPML as to whether it should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas for consolidation and coordination with the other Stanford-related actions. On June 11, 2013, Willis of Colorado, Inc. moved to stay the other four actions pending the JPML’s transfer decision. On June 20, 2013, the JPML issued a conditional transfer order for the transfer of the five actions to the Northern District of Texas, the transmittal of which was stayed for 7 days to allow for any opposition to be filed. On June 28, 2013, with no opposition having been filed, the JPML lifted the stay, enabling the transfer to go forward. On September 30, 2014, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to remand in Zacarias, and, on October 3, 2014, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motions to remand in Tisminesky and de Gadala Maria. On December 3, 2014 and March 3, 2015, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motions to remand in Barbar and Ranni, respectively, remanded both actions to Florida state court (Miami-Dade County) and stayed both actions until further order of the court. On January 2, 2015 and April 1, 2015, the plaintiffs in Barbar and Ranni, respectively, appealed the court’s December 3, 2014 and March 3, 2015 decisions to the Fifth Circuit. On April 22, 2015 and July 22, 2015, respectively, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the Barbar and Ranni appeals sua sponte for lack of jurisdiction. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaints in Ranni or Barbar.On April 1, 2015, the defendants except Willis Group Holdings plc filed motions to dismiss the complaints in Zacarias, Tisminesky and de Gadala-Maria.

On September 11, 2015, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaints. The motions await disposition by the court. •Janvey, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:13-CV-03980-D, was filed on October 1, 2013 also in the Northern District of Texas against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis Limited, Willis North America Inc., Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate. The complaint was filed (i) by Ralph S. Janvey, in his capacity as Court-31Appointed Receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate, and the Official Stanford Investors Committee (the ‘OSIC’) against all defendants and (ii) on behalf of a putative, worldwide class of Stanford investors against Willis North America Inc. Plaintiffs Janvey and the OSIC allege claims under Texas common law and the court’s Amended Order Appointing Receiver, and the putative class plaintiffs allege claims under Texas statutory and common law. Plaintiffs seek actual damages in excess of $1 billion, punitive damages and costs. As alleged by the Stanford Receiver, the total amount of collective losses allegedly sustained by all investors in Stanford certificates of deposit is approximately $4.6 billion. On November 15, 2013, plaintiffs in Janvey filed the operative First Amended Complaint, which added certain defendants unaffiliated with Willis. On February 28, 2014, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the First Amended Complaint, which motions, other than with respect to Willis Group Holding plc’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, were granted in part and denied in part by the court on December 5, 2014. On December 22, 2014, Willis filed a motion to amend the court’s December 5 order to certify an interlocutory appeal to the Fifth Circuit, and, on December 23, 2014, Willis filed a motion to amend and, to the extent necessary, reconsider the court’s December 5 order. On January 16, 2015, the defendants answered the First Amended Complaint. On January 28, 2015, the court denied Willis’s motion to amend the court’s December 5 order to certify an interlocutory appeal to the Fifth Circuit. On February 4, 2015, the court granted Willis’s motion to amend and, to the extent necessary, reconsider the December 5 order. As discussed above, on March 25, 2014, the parties in Troice and Janvey stipulated to the consolidation of the two actions for pre-trial purposes under Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On March 28, 2014, the Court ‘so ordered’ that stipulation and, thus, consolidated Troice and Janvey for pre-trial purposes under Rule 42(a). On January 26, 2015, the court entered an order setting a schedule for briefing and discovery regarding the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification, which schedule, among other things, provided for the submission of the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification (following the completion of briefing and discovery) on July 20, 2015. By letter dated March 4, 2015, the parties requested that the court consolidate the scheduling orders entered in Troice and Janvey to provide for a class certification submission date of April 20, 2015 in both cases. On March 6, 2015, the court entered an order consolidating the scheduling orders in Troice and Janvey, providing for a class certification submission date of April 20, 2015 in both cases, and vacating the July 20, 2015 class certification submission date in the original Janvey scheduling order.On November 17, 2015, Willis Group Holdings plc withdrew its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.On March 31, 2016, the parties in the Troice and Janvey actions entered into a settlement in principle that is described in more detail below.•Martin v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al., Case No. 201652115, was filed on August 5, 2016, on behalf of one Stanford investor against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis Limited, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate in Texas state court (Harris County). The complaint alleges claims under Texas statutory and common law and seeks actual damages of less than $100,000, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On September 12, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which added five more Stanford investors as plaintiffs and seeks damages in excess of $1 million. The defendants have not yet responded to the amended complaint in Martin. •Abel, et al. v. Willis of Colorado, Inc., et al., C.A. No. 3:16-cv-2601, was filed on September 12, 2016, on behalf of more than 300 Stanford investors against Willis Group Holdings plc, Willis Limited, Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the same Willis associate, also in the Northern District of Texas. The complaint alleges claims under Texas statutory and common law and seeks actual damages in excess of $135 million, exemplary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On November 10, 2016, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which, among other things, added several more Stanford investors as plaintiffs. The defendants have not yet responded to the complaint in Abel. The plaintiffs in Janvey and Troice and the other actions above seek overlapping damages, representing either the entirety or a portion of the total alleged collective losses incurred by investors in Stanford certificates of deposit, notwithstanding the fact that Legacy Willis acted as broker of record for only a portion of time that Stanford issued certificates of deposit. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a $70 million litigation provision for loss contingencies relating to the Stanford matters based on its ongoing review of a variety of factors as required by accounting standards.On March 31, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement in principle for $120 million relating to this litigation, and increased its provisions by $50 million during that quarter. Further details on this settlement in principle are given below. 32The settlement is contingent on a number of conditions, including court approval of the settlement and a bar order prohibiting any continued or future litigation against Willis related to Stanford, which may not be given. Therefore, the ultimate resolution of these matters may differ from the amount provided for. The Company continues to dispute the allegations and, to the extent litigation proceeds, to defend the lawsuits vigorously.Settlement. On March 31, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement in principle, as reflected in a Settlement Term Sheet, relating to the Stanford litigation matter. The Company agreed to the Settlement Term Sheet to eliminate the distraction, burden, expense and uncertainty of further litigation. In particular, the settlement and the related bar orders described below, if upheld through any appeals, would enable the Company (a newly-combined firm) to conduct itself with the bar orders’ protection from the continued overhang of matters alleged to have occurred approximately a decade ago. Further, the Settlement Term Sheet provided that the parties understood and agreed that there is no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company. The Company expressly denies any liability or wrongdoing with respect to the matters alleged in the Stanford litigation. On or about August 31, 2016, the parties to the settlement signed a formal Settlement Agreement memorializing the terms of the settlement as originally set forth in the Settlement Term Sheet. The parties to the Settlement Agreement are Ralph S. Janvey (in his capacity as the Court-appointed receiver (the ‘Receiver’) for The Stanford Financial Group and its affiliated entities in receivership (collectively, ‘Stanford’)), the Official Stanford Investors Committee, Samuel Troice, Martha Diaz, Paula Gilly-Flores, Punga Punga Financial, Ltd., Manuel Canabal, Daniel Gomez Ferreiro and Promotora Villa Marina, C.A. (collectively, ‘Plaintiffs’), on the one hand, and Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (formerly Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company), Willis Limited, Willis North America Inc., Willis of Colorado, Inc. and the Willis associate referenced above (collectively, ‘Defendants’), on the other hand. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the parties agreed to settle and dismiss the Janvey and Troice actions (collectively, the ‘Actions’) and all current or future claims arising from or related to Stanford in exchange for a one-time cash payment to the Receiver by the Company of $120 million to be distributed to all Stanford investors who have claims recognized by the Receiver pursuant to the distribution plan in place at the time the payment is made.The Settlement Agreement also provides the parties’ agreement to seek the Court’s entry of bar orders prohibiting any continued or future litigation against the Defendants and their related parties of claims relating to Stanford, whether asserted to date or not. The terms of the bar orders therefore would prohibit all Stanford-related litigation described above, and not just the Actions, but including any pending matters and any actions that may be brought in the future. Final Court approval of these bar orders is a condition of the settlement. On September 7, 2016, Plaintiffs filed with the Court a motion to approve the settlement. On October 19, 2016, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement. Several of the plaintiffs in the other actions above objected to the settlement, and a hearing to consider final approval of the settlement was held on January 20, 2017, after which the Court reserved decision. On August 23, 2017, the Court approved the settlement, including the bar orders. Several of the objectors have since appealed the settlement approval and bar orders to the Fifth Circuit. The appeals are currently pending. The Company will not make the $120 million settlement payment unless and until the appeals are decided in its favor and the settlement is not subject to any further appeal. City of HoustonOn August 1, 2014, the City of Houston (‘plaintiff’) filed suit against Legacy Towers Watson in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. On March 8, 2016, plaintiff filed its First Amended Complaint. In the amended complaint, plaintiff alleges various deficiencies in pension actuarial work-product and advice stated to have been provided by Legacy Towers Watson’s predecessor firm, Towers Perrin, in its capacity as principal actuary to the Houston Firefighters’ Relief and Retirement Fund (the ‘Fund’). Towers Perrin is stated to have acted in this capacity between “the early 1980s until 2003.” In particular, the amended complaint alleges “misrepresentations and miscalculations” in valuation reports allegedly issued by Towers Perrin from 2000 through 2002 upon which plaintiff claims to have relied. Plaintiff asserts that Towers Perrin assigned a new team of actuaries to the Fund in 2002 “to correct Towers’ own earlier mistakes” and that the new team “altered” certain calculations which “increased the actuarial accrued liability by $163 million.” Plaintiff claims that the reports indicated that the City’s minimum contribution percentages to the Fund would remain in place through at least 2019 and that existing benefits under the Fund could be increased, and new benefits could be added, without increasing plaintiff’s financial burden, and without increasing plaintiff’s rate of annual contributions to the Fund. The amended complaint alleges that plaintiff relied on these reports when supporting a new benefits package for the Fund. These reports, and other advice, are alleged, among other things, to have been negligent, to have misrepresented the present and future financial condition of the Fund and the contributions required to be made by plaintiff to support those benefits. Plaintiff asserts that, but for Towers Perrin’s alleged 33negligence and misrepresentations, plaintiff would not have supported the benefits increase, and that such increased benefits would not and could not have been approved or enacted. It is further asserted that Towers Perrin’s alleged “negligence and misrepresentations damaged the City to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in annual contributions.” The amended complaint seeks the award of punitive damages, actual damages, exemplary damages, special damages, attorney’s fees and expenses, costs of suit, pre- and post- judgment interest at the maximum legal rate, and other unspecified legal and equitable relief.On October 10, 2014, Legacy Towers Watson filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff’s entire complaint on the basis that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On November 21, 2014, the City filed its response in opposition to Legacy Towers Watson’s motion to dismiss. On September 23, 2015, Legacy Towers Watson’s motion to dismiss was denied by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. The court entered a Scheduling Order setting trial for May 30, 2017. On June 20, 2016, the Court entered a Second Amended Scheduling Order setting trial for October 31, 2017. On March 27, 2017, the Court entered a Third Amended Scheduling Order setting trial for January 16, 2018.On May 8, 2017, Legacy Towers Watson received the City’s expert’s damages report, which asserted the City has incurred actual damages of approximately $430 million through July 1, 2017, and will incur future damages that have a present value of approximately $400 million as of July 1, 2017 if the Fund pension benefits remain unchanged. On June 30, 2017, Legacy Towers Watson served its expert reports in rebuttal to the City’s expert reports. Legacy Towers Watson’s experts concluded that Legacy Towers Watson’s work was reasonable and conformed with the actuarial standards of practice, and that Legacy Towers Watson did not cause any damages to the City. Legacy Towers Watson’s experts also concluded that the City’s damages model is flawed.Given the stage of the proceedings, the Company is currently unable to provide an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company disputes the allegations, and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously.Meriter Health ServicesOn January 6, 2015, Meriter Health Services, Inc. (‘Meriter’), plan sponsor of the Meriter Health Services Employee Retirement Plan (the ‘Plan’) filed a complaint in Wisconsin state court against Towers Watson Delaware Inc. (‘TWDE’), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and against its former lawyers, individual actuaries, and insurers. In the Third Amended Complaint, served on April 12, 2016, Meriter alleged that Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, Inc. (‘TPFC’) and Davis, Conder, Enderle & Sloan, Inc. (‘DCES’), and other entities and individuals, including Meriter’s former lawyers, acted negligently concerning the benefits consulting advice provided to Meriter; these allegations concern matters including TPFC and the lawyers’ involvement in the Plan design and drafting of the Plan document in 1987 by TPFC, and DCES and the lawyers’ Plan review, Plan redesign, Plan amendment, and drafting of ERISA section 204(h) notices in the early 2000s. Additionally, Meriter asserted that TPFC, DCES, and the individual actuary defendants breached alleged fiduciary duties to advise Meriter regarding the competency of Meriter’s then ERISA counsel. Meriter has asserted causes of action for contribution, indemnity, and equitable subrogation related to amounts paid to settle a class action lawsuit related to the Plan that was filed by Plan participants against Meriter in 2010, alleging a number of ERISA violations and related claims. Meriter settled that lawsuit in 2015 for $82 million. In this litigation, Meriter sought damages in a revised amount of approximately $190 million which includes amounts it claims to have paid to settle and defend the class action litigation, and amounts it claims to have incurred as a result of improper plan design. Meriter sought to recover these alleged damages from TWDE and the other defendants.On January 12, 2016, TWDE and the other defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking dismissal of Meriter’s negligence and breach of fiduciary duty claims. On April 18, 2016, TWDE and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the contribution, indemnification, and equitable subrogation claims. On May 4, 2016, the parties appeared for oral argument on the motion for partial summary judgment, which the court granted in part and denied in part. The court dismissed the fiduciary duty claims, but not the negligence claims. Meriter subsequently moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of its breach of fiduciary duty claims, which motion was denied as to TWDE on August 16, 2016. On June 22, 2016, the court granted in part TWDE’s motion to dismiss, and dismissed the contribution and equitable subrogation claims, but denied the motion as to Meriter’s indemnification claim without prejudice to the right of any defendant to raise the issue again by later motion. On February 28, 2017, TWDE and the other defendants filed a motion to amend the scheduling order. The motion was granted on March 9, 2017, and the trial was re-scheduled to begin on December 11, 2017.On June 15, 2017, the Company and Meriter agreed to a settlement to resolve all claims in this case against the actuary defendants. The terms of the settlement are confidential. The settlement amount is not materially in excess of previously accrued amounts. As a result of the settlement, the Court, on July 27, 2017, dismissed all of Meriter’s claims in this case, in their entirety, with prejudice.34Elma Sanchez, et. al On August 6, 2013, three individual plaintiffs filed a putative class action suit against the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (‘CalPERS’) in Los Angeles County Superior Court. On January 10, 2014, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which added as defendants several members of CalPERS’ Board of Administration and three Legacy Towers Watson entities, Towers Watson & Co., Towers Perrin, and Tillinghast-Towers Perrin (‘Towers Perrin’). Plaintiffs’ claims all relate to a self-funded, non-profit Long Term Care Program that CalPERS established in 1995 (the ‘LTC Program’). Plaintiffs’ claims seek unspecified damages allegedly resulting from CalPERS’ 2012 decision to implement in 2015 and 2016 an 85 percent increase in the premium rates of certain of the long term care policies it issued between 1995 and 2004 (the ‘85% Increase’). The amended complaint alleges claims against CalPERS for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. It also includes a single cause of action against Towers Perrin for professional negligence relating to actuarial services Towers Perrin provided to CalPERS relating to the LTC Program between 1995 and 2004. Plaintiffs principally allege that CalPERS mismanaged the LTC Program and its investment assets in multiple respects and breached its contractual and fiduciary duties to plaintiffs and other class members by impermissibly imposing the 85% Increase to make up for investment losses. Plaintiffs also allege that Towers Perrin recommended inadequate initial premium rates at the outset of the LTC Program and used unspecified inappropriate assumptions in its annual valuations for CalPERS. Plaintiffs claim that Towers Perrin’s allegedly negligent acts and omissions, prior to the end of its retainer in 2004, contributed to the need for the 85% Increase. In May 2014, the court denied the motions to dismiss filed by CalPERS and Towers Perrin addressed to the sufficiency of the complaint. On January 28, 2016, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The certified class as currently defined includes those long term care policy holders whose policies were “subject to” the 85% Increase. The court thereafter set an October 2, 2017 trial date. In May 2016, the case was reassigned to a different judge. The court agreed that Towers Perrin may file a motion for summary judgment which was initially scheduled to be heard on February 3, 2017. The motion was then fully briefed, and the hearing date was thereafter moved to March 8, 2017. On March 1, 2017, Towers Perrin and Plaintiffs participated in a mediation and reached a settlement in principle. Pursuant to the settlement in principle, in exchange for a dismissal of the claims of all class members and a release of Towers Perrin by all class members, Towers Perrin would pay a total of $9.75 million into an interest-bearing settlement fund, to be used to reimburse class counsel's costs, and for later distribution to class members as approved by the Court. This proposed settlement amount was accrued during the three months ended March 31, 2017. A formal settlement agreement was submitted to the Court for its preliminary approval on May 18, 2017. On October 25, 2017, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement, and set a final fairness and final approval hearing on the settlement for January 26, 2018. The Court also granted the Company’s unopposed motion for a good faith settlement determination. Class members who properly object to the settlement have standing to appeal if the Court orders final approval of the settlement.Based on the stage of the proceedings, in the event the settlement is not finally approved, the Company is unable to provide an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss in respect of the plaintiffs’ complaint.European Commission and FCA Regulatory InvestigationsIn April 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) informed Willis Limited, our U.K. broking subsidiary, that it had opened a formal investigation into possible agreements/concerted practices in the aviation broking sector.In October 2017, the European Commission (‘Commission’) disclosed to us that it has initiated civil investigation proceedings in respect of a suspected infringement of E.U. competition rules involving several broking firms, including our principal U.K. broking subsidiary and one of its parent entities. In particular, the Commission has stated that the civil proceedings concern the exchange of commercially sensitive information between competitors in relation to aviation and aerospace insurance and reinsurance broking products and services in the European Economic Area, as well as possible coordination between competitors. The initiation of proceedings does not mean there has been a finding of infringement, merely that the Commission will investigate the case. Now that the Commission has initiated proceedings, the FCA has informed us that it has closed its competition act investigation. However, it retains its jurisdiction over broking regulatory matters arising from the conduct being investigated. 35Given the status of the investigation, the Company is currently unable to assess the terms on which this investigation, or any other regulatory matter emanating from the conduct being investigated, will be resolved, and thus is unable to provide an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.U.K. Investment Consulting InvestigationIn September 2017, the FCA announced that it would make a market investigation referral with respect to the investment consulting industry to the U.K. Competition & Markets Authority (the ‘CMA’). The CMA then commenced a market investigation, and the Company is currently cooperating with the investigation.The CMA investigation of the investment consulting market is expected to take at least 18 months to conclude. Given the early stage of the investigation, the Company is currently unable to assess whether the CMA will find any adverse effects on competition, and, if the CMA does find any adverse effects on competition, what remedies it may impose on the industry. Given this, the Company is unable to provide an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.Note 13 — Supplementary Information for Certain Balance Sheet Accounts Related Party Transaction - During the three months ended September 30, 2017, the Company divested its Global Wealth Solutions business through a sale to an employee of the business. As part of that transaction, WTW financed a $50 million note payable from the employee to purchase the business. The note amortizes over 10 years, bears interest at 3% and is guaranteed by $3 million of assets. Following the sale, employees of this business are no longer employees of WTW, and the purchasing employee is no longer considered a related party.

See Note 8 — Derivative Financial Instruments for additional details regarding the reclassification adjustments for the hedge settlements.iiReclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost (see Note 11 — Retirement Benefits) which is included in Salaries and benefits in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.37Note 15 — Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson by the average number of ordinary shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities and other contracts to issue shares were exercised or converted into shares or resulted in the issuance of shares that then shared in the net income of the Company.At September 30, 2017 and 2016, there were 0.9 million and 1.3 million time-based share options; 1.0 million and 1.2 million performance-based options; 0.4 million and 0.9 million restricted time-based stock units; and 0.6 million and 0.7 million restricted performance-based stock units outstanding, respectively. Basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016Net (loss)/income attributable to Willis Towers Watson$(54) $(32) $323 $278        Basic average number of shares outstanding 134 138 136 137Dilutive effect of potentially issuable shares — — 1 2Diluted average number of shares outstanding 134 138 137 139        Basic (loss)/earnings per share $(0.40) $(0.23) $2.38 $2.03Dilutive effect of potentially issuable shares — — (0.02) (0.03)Diluted (loss)/earnings per share $(0.40) $(0.23) $2.36 $2.00The dilutive effect of stock options was not computed for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 as the Company reported a net loss within its condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. There were no anti-dilutive options for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Options to purchase 0.6 million shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were not included in the computation of the dilutive effect of stock options because their effect was anti-dilutive. Note 16 — Subsequent Events On November 1, 2017, the Company sold a portion of its programs business in North America. The revenue associated with the divested programs represents less than 2% of our IRR segment’s total revenues. 38Note 17 — Financial Information for Parent Guarantor, Other Guarantor Subsidiaries and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries Willis North America Inc. (‘Willis North America’) has $837 million senior notes outstanding of which $187 million were issued on September 29, 2009, and $650 million were issued on May 16, 2017. Additionally, Willis North America had $394 million of senior notes issued on March 28, 2007; these were subsequently repaid on March 28, 2017.All direct obligations under the senior notes are jointly and severally, irrevocably and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Willis Netherlands Holdings B.V., Willis Investment U.K. Holdings Limited, TA I Limited, Trinity Acquisition plc, Willis Group Limited, Willis Towers Watson Sub Holdings Unlimited Company and Willis Towers Watson UK Holdings Limited, collectively the ‘Other Guarantors’, and with Willis Towers Watson, the ‘Guarantor Companies’.On August 11, 2017 a newly formed entity, Willis Towers Watson UK Holdings Limited, became the successor to, and assumed all guarantees of, WTW Bermuda Holdings Limited under the outstanding indentures for the senior notes described above. As both entities are direct subsidiaries of TA I Limited, and sub-consolidate within the ‘Other Guarantors’ columns of the financial statements presented herein, there is no significant impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements from what has previously been disclosed. Please refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 16, 2017 for additional information regarding this change.The guarantor structure described above differs from the guarantor structure associated with the senior notes issued by Willis Towers Watson described in Note 18 and the guarantor structure associated with the senior notes and revolving credit facility issued by Trinity Acquisition plc described in Note 19. Presented below is condensed consolidating financial information for:(i)Willis Towers Watson, which is a guarantor, on a parent company only basis;(ii)the Other Guarantors, which are all 100 percent

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis discussion includes forward-looking statements. See ‘Disclaimer Regarding Forward-looking Statements’ for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements. This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company’s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future. See ‘Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ below for further discussion of our adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures. Executive OverviewMarket ConditionsDue to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate. Market conditions in our broking industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients. Management has considered the U.K. referendum vote on June 23, 2016 to depart from the E.U., the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon (providing the right to and procedures for a member to leave the E.U.) on March 29, 2017, the early general election held on June 8, 2017, and the uncertainties about the near-term and longer-term effects of Brexit on the Company. The terms of Brexit, and its impact, are highly uncertain. For a further discussion of the risks of Brexit to the Company, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017. Typically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We believe that the U.K. has good long-term growth opportunities and, given that, we believe the impact to Willis Towers Watson will be neutral to slightly positive over the next few years, with some periods of increase and decrease in that time frame. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change. On an annual basis for 2017, although we expect that approximately 22% of our revenues will be generated in the U.K., we expect that only about 13% of revenues will be denominated in Pounds sterling, as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. We expect that approximately 19% of our expenses will be denominated in Pounds sterling; thus, we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency. The markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and private exchange services are subject to changes as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As 66these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth.See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017 for a discussion of risks that may affect our ability to compete. Financial Statement OverviewThe table below sets forth our summarized condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated.

Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $6.1 billion, compared to $6.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $164 million or 3%. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, our revenue grew by 4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The quarterly and year-to-date increases in revenues were driven by strong performances in all segments. Our revenues can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, currency translation increased our consolidated revenues by $12 million; for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenues by $81 million. The primary currencies driving these changes were the Pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, and the Euro. 67The following table details our top five markets based on the percentage of consolidated revenues (in U.S. dollars) from the countries where work is performed for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. These figures do not represent the currency of the related revenue, which is presented in the next table.Geographic Region% of RevenuesUnited States49%United Kingdom22%France5%Germany3%Canada3%The table below details the percentage of our revenues and expenses by transactional currency for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.Transactional CurrencyRevenues Expenses (i)U.S. dollars55% 51%Pounds sterling13% 19%Euro15% 12%Other currencies17% 18%____________________ i.These percentages exclude certain expenses for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include Merger-related amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, and transaction and integration expenses. The components of the change in revenues generated for the three month and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:  Three Months Ended September 30,   Components of Revenue Change(i)  2017 2016 As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  ($ in millions)     Total revenues $1,852 $1,777 4% 1% 4% —% 4%  Nine Months Ended September 30,   Components of Revenue Change(i)  2017 2016 As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  ($ in millions)     Total revenues $6,124 $5,960 3% (1)% 4% —% 4%____________________i.Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.Definitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included under the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere within Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. Segment RevenuesBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Part I, Item 1. Note 4 — Segment Information of this Form 10-Q report for a further discussion of these changes.The segment descriptions below should be read in conjunction with the full descriptions of our businesses contained in Part I, Item 1. Business, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017, as updated by the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017.The Company experiences seasonal fluctuations of its commissions and fees revenue. Revenue is typically higher during the Company’s first and fourth quarters due primarily to timing of broking-related activities.68Human Capital and Benefits (‘HCB’)The HCB segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for our clients. HCB is the largest segment of the Company. The segment is focused on addressing our clients’ employee and risk needs so that they can deliver sustainable employee experiences. This segment also delivers full outsourcing solutions to employers outside of the United States. The following table sets forth the components of HCB revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended September 30, 2017 from the three months ended September 30, 2016.      Components of Revenue Change (i)  Three Months Ended September 30, As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Commissions and fees $736 $720 2% 1% 2% (1)% 3%Interest and other income — —          Total segment revenues $736 $720          ____________________i.Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.HCB commissions and fees, and total segment revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were $736 million and $720 million, respectively. As expected, Retirement commissions and fees declined slightly in the third quarter due to the expected decrease in bulk lump sum work in the U.S. as compared to the third quarter of 2016. Great Britain’s commissions and fees increase was primarily related to pension legislation in the U.K., and International’s commissions and fees increase was due to higher demand for consulting work. Talent and Rewards commissions and fees were up slightly as a result of our product offerings and higher demand for change management consulting, offset by a slight decline in rewards advisory projects. Health and Benefits commissions and fees growth was moderate, as we experienced strong growth in Great Britain and Western Europe, with low growth in North America, and a decline in International due primarily to the sale of our Global Wealth Solutions business. Commissions and fees in the Technology and Administration Solutions business experienced strong growth in all regions as a result of new administration clients and project activity. The following table sets forth the components of HCB revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Retirement revenues decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period last year. The decrease occurred in North America and Western Europe and was partially offset by growth in International and Great Britain. The decline in North America was expected as bulk lump sum projects declined year over year. Actuarial consulting projects in Great Britain were strong due to regulation changes. Talent and Rewards experienced a large drop in revenues, primarily in the Rewards, Talent and Communication consulting business in North America. The restructuring program impacted this region the hardest, and as expected, external marketing efforts were impacted during this initiative, which resulted in a lower pipeline for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period last year. Healthcare consulting revenues were up significantly for all markets globally. Revenue in the Technology and Administration Solutions business in Great Britain experienced strong growth as a result of new administration clients and project activity. 69Corporate Risk and Broking (‘CRB’)The CRB segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance broking and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations. The segment delivers innovative, integrated global solutions tailored to client needs and underpinned by data and analytics. CRB operates as an integrated global team comprising both functional and geographic leadership. In these operations, we have extensive specialized experience handling diverse lines of insurance coverage, including complex risk management programs. A key objective is to assist clients in reducing their overall cost of risk. The following table sets forth the components of CRB revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended September 30, 2017 from the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Commissions and fees for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were $581 million and $553 million, respectively. As expected, North America commissions and fees produced strong growth, with all sub-regions showing commissions and fees growth. International continued to have strong commissions and fees growth primarily from Russia, South Africa and Asia. Western Europe had solid growth led by Sweden and Benelux. Great Britain commissions and fees declined slightly as a result of declines in Transport and a strong comparable in the prior-year third quarter. The following table sets forth the components of CRB revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Revenue growth was led by International with additional growth in Great Britain and Western Europe. International’s and Great Britain’s growth was fueled by solid client retention and strong new business. Western Europe had strong client retention and modest new business growth. Investment, Risk and Reinsurance (‘IRR’)The IRR segment uses a sophisticated approach to risk, which helps clients free up capital and manage investment complexity. The segment works closely with investors, reinsurers and insurers to manage the equation between risk and return. Blending advanced analytics with deep institutional knowledge, IRR identifies new opportunities to maximize performance. IRR provides investment consulting services and insurance specific services and solutions through reserves opinions, software, ratemaking, usage-based insurance, risk underwriting and reinsurance broking.  70The following table sets forth the components of IRR revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended September 30, 2017 from the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Commissions and fees for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were $320 million and $312 million, respectively. Insurance Consulting and Technology, formerly Risk Consulting and Software, led the growth for the segment as a result of increased project work in Great Britain and a soft comparable in Western Europe. Max Matthiessen, Wholesale and the Securities business showed commissions and fees growth, primarily as a result of strong sales and increased performance fees. Reinsurance and Investment both experienced revenue growth, but commissions and fees were flat for both groups. The reduction in Portfolio and Underwriting Services commissions and fees was driven by a loss of profit commissions following the Atlantic hurricanes, the cancellation of a key contract, and the divestiture of small programs in the portfolio. The following table sets forth the components of IRR revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Total segment revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included £28 million ($41 million) received for a settlement related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie Team. Commissions and fees for both the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were $1.2 billion. Wholesale, Investment, Insurance Consulting and Technology, Max Matthiessen, Securities and Reinsurance all posted commissions and fees revenue growth, primarily as a result of strong sales and increased performance fees. The reduction in Portfolio and Underwriting Services commissions and fees was driven by a loss of profit commissions following the Atlantic hurricanes, the cancellation of a key contract, and the divestiture of small programs in the portfolio. Benefits Delivery and Administration (‘BDA’)The BDA segment, formerly known as Exchange Solutions, provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets. BDA services individual populations via its ‘group to individual’ technology platform, which tightly integrates patented call routing technology, an efficient quoting and enrollment engine, a custom-developed Customer Relationship Management system and comprehensive insurance carrier connectivity. This segment also delivers group benefit exchanges and full outsourcing solutions serving the active employees of employers across the United States. BDA uses Software as a Service (‘SaaS’)-based technology and related services to deliver consumer-driven healthcare and reimbursement accounts, including health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, flexible spending accounts and other consumer-directed accounts. 71The following table sets forth the components of BDA revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended September 30, 2017 from the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Individual Marketplace, formerly Retiree and Access Exchanges, commissions and fees increased by 9% and the rest of the segment grew by 15%, led by Group Marketplace, formerly Active Exchanges, and Benefits Outsourcing, formerly Technology and Administration Solutions. Growth in the Individual and Group Marketplaces was a result of the additional 2017 enrollments, and Benefit Outsourcing’s growth was a result of new client wins. The following table sets forth the components of BDA revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 from the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Individual Marketplace revenues increased by 10%, and the rest of the segment grew by 16%, led by Group Marketplace and Benefits Outsourcing. BDA revenue growth is expected to slow to around 10% in 2017 due to the stabilization of the retiree enrollments. We continue to expect the Group Marketplace growth to be strong. Costs of Providing Services Total costs of providing services were $1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared to $1.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $35 million or 2%. Total costs of providing services were $5.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to $5.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1 million. See the analysis below for further information. Salaries and benefitsSalaries and benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were $1.1 billion, compared to $1.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $26 million. This increase was a result of higher incentive accruals as compared to the prior year. Salaries and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $3.5 billion, compared to $3.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $35 million. Salaries and benefits costs decreased during the year-to-date periods due to savings associated with our integration and restructuring plans, stemming from reduced headcount and shifting work to lower-cost locations. 72Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue decreased from 63% to 62% for the quarter and from 59% to 57% year-to-date. Other operating expensesOther operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were $366 million, compared to $370 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $4 million, or 1%. This $4 million decrease was due primarily to lower professional liability costs, partially offset by increased professional services expenses. As a result of this cost decrease, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 21% to 20%. Other operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $1.2 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $13 million, or 1%. This $13 million decrease was due primarily to the Stanford litigation provision of $50 million in the first half of 2016, partially offset by reserves for the CalPERS litigation and increases in other litigation reserves and professional services. Other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 20% to 19%. Depreciation Depreciation for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $54 million, compared to $45 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $9 million, or 20%. Depreciation for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $151 million, compared to $132 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $19 million, or 14%. These increases were due primarily to a higher depreciable base of assets resulting from additional assets placed in service during 2016. Amortization Amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $141 million, compared to $157 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $16 million, or 10%. Amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $441 million, compared to $443 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $2 million. Our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles, and therefore amortization will decrease over time. Restructuring costs Restructuring costs for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were $31 million, compared to $49 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $18 million, or 37%. Restructuring costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $85 million, compared to $115 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $30 million, or 26%. These costs were incurred primarily in connection with the Operational Improvement Program, for which the Company expects to incur $130 million of restructuring costs during 2017, the final year of the program, bringing the cumulative restructuring charges for this program to approximately $440 million. Refer to Part 1, Item 1. Note 5 — Restructuring Costs for additional information regarding these costs.Transaction and integration expenses Transaction and integration expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were $74 million, compared to $36 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $38 million, or 106%. Transaction and integration expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $177 million, compared to $117 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $60 million, or 51%. The increase in expenses primarily related to costs associated with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (see Part I, Item 1. Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings for additional information), along with costs associated with our other integration activities.Income from Operations Income from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $41 million, compared to $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $40 million. This increase resulted from an increase to total revenue of $75 million, partially offset by increased costs of providing services of $35 million.Income from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $628 million, compared to $463 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $165 million, or 36%. This increase resulted primarily from additional revenue of $164 million.73Interest Expense Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $47 million, compared to $45 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $2 million, or 4%. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $139 million, compared to $138 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1 million, or 1%. The increase in interest expense resulted from additional levels of indebtedness. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $29 million, compared to $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $15 million. Other expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $79 million, compared to $26 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $53 million. The additional expense in 2017 as compared to the prior year related to the impact of foreign exchange hedging contracts, unfavorable balance sheet remeasurement and further devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2017, the Company recorded a loss of $10 million associated with the disposal of the Global Wealth Solutions business.Provision for/(Benefit from) Income Taxes Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was a provision of $19 million, compared to an income tax benefit of $26 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase to income tax expense of $45 million. The effective tax rate was (53.0)% for the three months ended September 30, 2017, and 45.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The (53.0)% effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was the result of a discrete income tax charge for an internal reorganization. Our effective tax rate is generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. This is primarily due to our global mix of income, which results in deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates.Provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $73 million, compared to $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $62 million. The effective tax rate was 17.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and 3.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a current year U.S. tax expense resulting from internal reorganizations for certain legacy Towers Watson businesses, compared with a prior year tax benefit resulting from an enacted statutory tax rate reduction in the U.K.Net (Loss)/Income Attributable to Willis Towers WatsonNet loss attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $54 million, compared to $32 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, a net loss increase of $22 million, or 69%. This additional loss resulted from increases in revenues for the quarter being more than offset by increases in the total costs of providing services, provision for income taxes, and other expenses, net. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $323 million, compared to $278 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $45 million, or 16%. This $45 million increase resulted from additional income from operations of $165 million, partially offset by increases in provision for income taxes and other expenses, net.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesExecutive SummaryOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings. Based on our balance sheets, combined cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that Willis Towers Watson has sufficient liquidity, which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in the business for growth, creating value through the integration of Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments, and contemplated share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. Historically, we have not provided deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of our subsidiaries that have been reinvested indefinitely. As a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired Towers Watson foreign operations, we continue to accrue deferred taxes on current year earnings of those subsidiaries. However, we assert that the 74historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries are reinvested indefinitely, and therefore do not provide deferred tax liabilities on these amounts. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, long-term investment requirements or U.S. tax reform necessitate that additional earnings be distributed, an incremental provision for income and foreign withholding taxes, net of credits, may be necessary. Other potential sources of cash may be through settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a tax-efficient manner. Events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results, potential future acquisitions or divestitures, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters, or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets. In May 2017, we completed an offering of $650 million of 3.600% Senior Notes due 2024. Net proceeds of $644 million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.In March 2017, we entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility replacing our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings against the $1.25 billion facility of $409 million and €45 million were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the $800 million facility and the 7-year term loan due July 23, 2018.Additionally in March 2017, the Company repaid the 6.200% senior notes due 2017 totaling $407 million, including accrued interest.Assets and liabilities associated with non-U.S. entities have been translated into U.S. dollars as of September 30, 2017 at U.S. dollar rates that fluctuate compared to historical periods. As a result, cash flows derived from changes in the condensed consolidated balance sheets include the impact of the change in foreign exchange translation rates.Cash and Cash EquivalentsOur cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2017 totaled $912 million, compared to $870 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in cash from December 31, 2016 to September 30, 2017 was due primarily to foreign currency translation, as cash flows from operating activities were offset by our investing and financing activities.Additionally, at September 30, 2017, $329 million was available to draw against our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility as compared to $557 million, which was available to draw against our previous $800 million revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016. Included within cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are amounts held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements, including $89 million and $87 million, respectively, held within our regulated U.K. entities for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.Summarized Condensed Consolidated Cash FlowsThe following table presents the summarized consolidated cash flow information for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 (in millions)Net cash from/(used in):    Operating activities$515 $621 Investing activities(262) 283 Financing activities(246) (659)INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS7 245Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents35 (10)CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, BEGINNING OF PERIOD870 532CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, END OF PERIOD$912 $767Cash Flows From Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities were $515 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $621 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The $515 million net cash from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 included net income of $339 million, adjusted for $579 75million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $403 million. The decrease in cash flows from operations in 2017 primarily resulted from changes in working capital and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger. The $621 million of cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included net income of $290 million and $498 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $167 million. Cash Flows (Used In)/From Investing ActivitiesCash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $262 million, driven primarily by capital expenditures and capitalized software costs.Cash flows from investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $283 million, driven primarily by $476 million of cash acquired as a result of the Merger, which was a non-cash transaction as it was consummated through the issuance of shares. Fixed asset purchases and capitalized costs of developing software for internal use totaled $215 million. Cash Flows Used In Financing ActivitiesCash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $246 million. The significant financing activities included the payment of $177 million related to the cancellation of Towers Watson shares in connection with the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (consisting of the portion of the settlement equal to the value of consideration that would have been due to the shareholders at the closing of the Merger if they had exchanged their shares; see Part I, Item 1. Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings for additional information), share repurchases of $462 million and dividend payments of $209 million, which were partially offset by net borrowings of $634 million. Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $659 million, driven primarily by debt issuance of $2.0 billion, debt repayments of $1.9 billion, net payments on the revolving credit facility of $389 million, dividend payments of $133 million, and share repurchases of $222 million.  IndebtednessTotal debt, total equity, and the capitalization ratio at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows:  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 ($ in millions)Long-term debt$4,493 $3,357Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt85 508Total debt$4,578 $3,865    Total Willis Towers Watson shareholders’ equity$9,915 $10,065    Capitalization ratio31.6% 27.7%At September 30, 2017, our material mandatory debt repayments over the next twelve months include scheduled repayments of $85 million on our term loan maturing in 2019.At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. Fiduciary FundsAs an intermediary, we hold funds, generally in a fiduciary capacity, for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities on our balance sheets.Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.At September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had fiduciary funds of $3.1 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Share Repurchase ProgramThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. At September 30, 2017, approximately $671 million remained on the current repurchase authority. The maximum number of shares that could be repurchased based on the closing price of our ordinary shares on September 30, 2017 of $154.23 was 4,351,419. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company had the following share repurchase activity: Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017Shares repurchased1,116,645 3,354,482Average price per share$148.83 $137.72Aggregate repurchase cost (excluding broker costs)$166 million $462 millionIn addition to the shares reported in the table above, the Company canceled 1,415,199 Towers Watson common shares at issue in the settlement of the Merger-related appraisal demand lawsuit (see Part I, Item 1. Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Proceedings for additional information) and an equivalent number of ordinary shares represented in the Company’s issued and outstanding share count up until the settlement date. As a result, the litigation settlement and related share cancellation had a similar impact to a share repurchase in that it reduced the number of outstanding shares of the Company. However, it did not impact the remaining authority under the share repurchase program.76Capital CommitmentsCapital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use were $198 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The Company estimates that there will be additional such expenditures of approximately $75 million during the remainder of 2017. We expect cash from operations to adequately provide for these cash needs. There have been no material changes to our capital commitments since December 31, 2016.DividendsTotal cash dividends of $209 million were paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. In September 2017, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.53 per share ($2.12 per share annualized rate), which was paid on October 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2017.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsOff-Balance Sheet TransactionsSee Part II, Item 7. ‘Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017, for a discussion pertaining to off-balance sheet transactions.Contractual ObligationsOperating Leases. We lease office space and furniture under operating lease agreements with terms typically ranging from three to twenty years. We have determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year. Consequently, management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense on leases will be mainly market-driven. We also lease cars and selected computer equipment under operating lease agreements. For acquired operating leases, intangible assets or liabilities have been recognized for the differences between the contractual cash obligations and the estimated market rates at the time of acquisition. These intangibles are amortized to rent expense but do not affect our contractual cash obligations. There have been no material changes to our operating lease obligations since we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on March 1, 2017.Material changes to our other contractual obligations since we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on March 1, 2017, are discussed in Note 9 — Debt and Note 11 — Retirement Benefits.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn order to assist readers of our condensed consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that Willis Towers Watson’s management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes, we present the following non-GAAP measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure: Most Directly Comparable U.S. GAAP MeasureNon-GAAP MeasureTotal revenuesAdjusted revenuesAs reported changeConstant currency changeAs reported changeOrganic changeIncome from operationsAdjusted operating incomeNet incomeAdjusted EBITDANet income attributable to Willis Towers WatsonAdjusted net incomeDiluted earnings per shareAdjusted diluted earnings per shareIncome from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associatesAdjusted income before taxesProvision for income taxes/U.S. GAAP tax rateAdjusted income taxes/tax rateNet cash from operating activitiesFree cash flowThe Company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results. Within these measures, we have adjusted for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include the following:•Restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses - Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time, or one-time Merger-related transaction expenses. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when these programs will have concluded. 77•Fair value adjustment to deferred revenue - Adjustment in 2016 to normalize for the deferred revenue written down as part of the purchase accounting for the Merger. •Gains and losses on disposals of operations - Adjustment to remove the gain or loss resulting from disposed operations.•Provision for Stanford litigation - The 2016 provision for the Stanford litigation matter, which we consider to be a non-ordinary course litigation matter. •Venezuelan currency devaluation - Foreign exchange losses incurred as a consequence of the Venezuelan government’s enforced changes to exchange rate mechanisms. •Tax effects of internal reorganization - Relates to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain businesses that reduced the investments held by our U.S.-controlled subsidiaries.These non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our condensed consolidated financial statements. Adjusted Revenues We consider adjusted revenues to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. Adjusted revenues is defined as total revenues adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenues that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions. U.S. GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue. We have included the reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues in the table below, together with our reconciliation of the revenues change to the constant currency and organic changes. Constant Currency Change and Organic Change We evaluate our revenues on an as reported (U.S. GAAP), constant currency and organic basis. We believe providing constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally. •Constant currency change - Represents the year over year change in revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenues, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenues, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.•Organic change - The organic presentation excludes both the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as described above, as well as the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that excluding transaction-related items from our U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors, and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not incurred these transaction-related items, since the nature, size and number of these transaction-related items can vary from period to period. The constant currency and organic change results, and a reconciliation from the reported results for consolidated revenues are included in the Consolidated Revenues section within this Form 10-Q. These measures are also reported by segment in the Segment Revenues section within this Form 10-Q. 78Reconciliations of total revenues to adjusted revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, and reconciliations of the reported changes to the constant currency and organic changes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 are as follows:      Components of Revenue Change(i)  Three Months Ended September 30, As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Total revenues $1,852 $1,777 4% 1% 4% —% 4%____________________i.Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding.

Adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.Reconciliations of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions)Income from operations$41 $1 $628 $463Adjusted for certain items:      Amortization141 157 441 443Restructuring costs31 49 85 115Transaction and integration expenses74 36 177 117Provision for the Stanford litigation— — — 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— — — 58Adjusted operating income$287 $243 $1,331 $1,246Adjusted operating income increased for the three months ended September 30, 2017 to $287 million, compared to $243 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of strong revenue growth during the quarter from increased client demand.Adjusted operating income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion for the prior year period, an increase of $85 million, or 7%. Income from operations increased by $165 million, largely due to additional client demand and lower salaries and benefits expense resulting from savings associated with our integration and restructuring plans, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to a higher depreciable base of assets.79Adjusted EBITDAWe consider adjusted EBITDA to be an important financial measure, which is used internally to evaluate and assess our core operations, to benchmark our operating results against our competitors, and to evaluate and measure our performance-based compensation plans.Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income/(loss) adjusted for provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, (gain)/loss on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.Reconciliations of net (loss)/income to adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 20172016 2017 2016 (in millions)NET (LOSS)/INCOME$(54) $(31) $339 $290Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes19 (26) 73 11Interest expense47 45 139 138Depreciation54 45 151 132Amortization141 157 441 443Restructuring costs31 49 85 115Transaction and integration expenses74 36 177 117Provision for the Stanford litigation— — — 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— — — 58Loss/(gain) on disposal of operations10 — 10 (2)Venezuela currency devaluation — — 2 —Adjusted EBITDA$322 $275 $1,417 $1,352Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $322 million, compared to $275 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Revenue growth from increased client demand, driven by all segments, was partially offset by adverse foreign currency movements.Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 was $1.4 billion, an increase of $65 million, or 5%. The prior year included settlement income of £28 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team.Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAdjusted net income is defined as net income/(loss) attributable to Willis Towers Watson adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, (gain)/loss on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, diluted. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. 80Reconciliations of net loss attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 ($ in millions)NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO WILLIS TOWERS WATSON$(54) $(32)Adjusted for certain items: Amortization141 157Restructuring costs31 49Transaction and integration expenses74 36Loss on disposal of operations10 —Tax effect on certain items listed above (i)(74) (67)Tax effects of internal reorganization22 —Adjusted net income$150 $143    Weighted average shares of common stock — diluted 134 138    Diluted loss per share $(0.40) $(0.23)Adjusted for certain items:   Amortization1.05 1.14Restructuring costs0.23 0.36Transaction and integration expenses0.55 0.26Loss on disposal of operations0.08 —Tax effect on certain items listed above (i)(0.55) (0.49)Tax effects of internal reorganization0.16 —Adjusted diluted earnings per share $1.12 $1.04 __________________________i.The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased for the three months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the prior year primarily due to revenue growth from increased client demand.81Reconciliations of net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are as follows: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 ($ in millions)NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO WILLIS TOWERS WATSON$323 $278Adjusted for certain items: Amortization441 443Restructuring costs85 115Transaction and integration expenses177 117Provision for the Stanford litigation— 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 58Loss/(gain) on disposal of operations10 (2)Venezuela currency devaluation 2 —Tax effect on certain items listed above (i)(219) (221)Tax effects of internal reorganization41 —Adjusted net income$860 $838    Weighted average shares of common stock — diluted 137 139    Diluted earnings per share $2.36 $2.00Adjusted for certain items:   Amortization3.23 3.19Restructuring costs0.62 0.83Transaction and integration expenses1.30 0.84Provision for the Stanford litigation— 0.36Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 0.42Loss/(gain) on disposal of operations0.07 (0.02)Venezuela currency devaluation 0.02 —Tax effect on certain items listed above (i)(1.60) (1.59)Tax effects of internal reorganization0.30 —Adjusted diluted earnings per share $6.30 $6.03__________________________i.The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.As noted above, in analyzing both our adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA, the Company experienced additional client demand and lower salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share benefited from this revenue growth.Adjusted Income Before Taxes and Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax RateAdjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, (gain)/loss on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.Adjusted income taxes/tax rate is defined as the provision for/(benefit from) income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, (gain)/loss on disposal of operations, tax effects of internal reorganization and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, 82significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.Management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items and the tax effects of our internal reorganization, which are not core to our current and future operations.Reconciliations of income/(loss) from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates to adjusted income before taxes and provision for/(benefit from) income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are as follows:  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 20172016 2017 2016 ($ in millions)(LOSS)/INCOME FROM OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND INTEREST IN EARNINGS OF ASSOCIATES$(35) $(58) $410 $299Adjusted for certain items:       Amortization141 157 441 443Restructuring costs31 49 85 115Transaction and integration expenses74 36 177 117Provision for the Stanford litigation— — — 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— — — 58Loss/(gain) on disposal of operations10 — 10 (2)Venezuela currency devaluation— — 2 —Adjusted income before taxes$221 $184 $1,125 $1,080        Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes$19 $(26) $73 $11Tax effect on certain items listed above(i)74 67 219 221Tax effects of internal reorganization(22) — (41) —Adjusted income taxes$71 $41 $251 $232        U.S. GAAP tax rate(53.0)% 45.9% 17.7% 3.5%Adjusted income tax rate32.1 % 22.2% 22.3% 21.4%__________________________i.The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.Our U.S. GAAP tax rate is generally lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%. This is primarily due to our global mix of income, which results in deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate was (53.0)% and 45.9%  for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 17.7% and 3.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Our adjusted income tax rates were 32.1% and 22.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 22.3% and 21.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in the adjusted tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to a prior year tax benefit resulting from an enacted statutory tax rate reduction in the U.K.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use and is used to evaluate our liquidity.83Reconciliations of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016(i) (in millions)Cash flows from operating activities$515 $621Less: Additions to fixed assets and software for internal use(198) (151)Free cash flow$317 $470__________________________i.As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $13 million, increasing free cash flow by the same amount. See Part I, Item 1. Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements of this Form 10-Q report for a further discussion of this change.The decrease in free cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily resulted from higher capital expenditures, unfavorable changes in working capital and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThere were no material changes from the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017.ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe have considered changes in our exposure to market risks during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and have determined that there have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks from those described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017.ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs of September 30, 2017, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) and the Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that the information required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we began to consolidate our legacy enterprise resource planning accounting systems in certain geographies. During this time, the Legacy Willis operations of our North American, U.K., Irish, Australian and New Zealand businesses were migrated to the Legacy Towers Watson global system. The U.K. and Irish businesses were migrated during the three months ended September 30, 2017 and such implementation changes were material. All other migrations noted above occurred during the two previous quarters of 2017. Transition to the global information system includes a significant effort in testing prior to system launch, training of colleagues who will be using the system, updating of our internal control process and procedures that will be impacted by the implementation and monitoring of the system's results. As a result of this implementation, our management has updated the system of internal controls over the impacted areas for adequacy of design and operating effectiveness. Subsequent geography deployments will be incorporated into existing controls.There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.84Limitations on the Effectiveness of ControlsManagement, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud. However, management does expect that the control system provides reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. In addition, the design of such internal controls must take into account the costs of designing and maintaining such a control system. Certain inherent limitations exist in control systems to make absolute assurances difficult, including the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake, and that individuals can circumvent controls. The design of any control system is based in part upon existing business conditions and risk assessments. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. As a result, they may require change or revision. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. Nevertheless, the disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 85PART II.
