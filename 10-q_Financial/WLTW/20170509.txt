Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017. Typically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We believe that the U.K. has good long-term growth opportunities and, given that, we believe the impact to Willis Towers Watson will be neutral to slightly positive over the next couple of years, with some periods of increase and decrease in that time frame. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change. On an annual basis for 2017, although we expect that approximately 22% of our revenues will be generated in the U.K., we expect that only about 12% of revenues will be denominated in Pounds sterling, as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. We expect that approximately 19% of our expenses will be denominated in Pounds sterling; thus, we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, where revenues are generated in currencies different from the currency of the related expenses, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency. The markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and private exchange services are subject to changes as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As 55these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth.See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017 for a discussion of risks that may affect our ability to compete. Financial Statement OverviewThe table below sets forth our summarized condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated.

All segments contributed to the increase in revenues, especially Human Capital and Benefits, which had strong demand and increased utilization, and Exchange Solutions. Additionally, our prior year consolidated revenues were reduced by $32 million that was not recognized during 2016 due to the write-off of deferred revenue as part of the purchase accounting for the Merger. The components of the change in revenue generated for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:  Three Months Ended March 31,   Components of Revenue Change  2017 2016 As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  ($ in millions)     Revenue $2,319 $2,234 4% (2)% 6% —% 6%Definitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included under the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere within Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. Our revenues can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenues by $50 million. The primary currencies driving the change were the Pound sterling and the Euro. 56The following table details our top five markets based on the percentage of consolidated revenues (in U.S. dollars) from the countries where work is performed for the three months ended March 31, 2017. These figures do not represent the currency of the related revenue, which is presented in the next table.Geographic Region% of RevenuesUnited States45%United Kingdom22%France9%Germany3%Canada2%The table below details our revenues and expenses by transactional currency for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

These items include Merger-related amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, and integration expenses. Segment RevenuesBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Part I, Item 1. Note 4 — Segment Information of this Form 10-Q report for a further discussion of these changes.The segment descriptions below should be read in conjunction with the full descriptions of our businesses contained in Part I, Item 1. Business, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017, as updated by the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017.The Company experiences seasonal fluctuations of its commissions and fees revenue. Revenue is typically higher during the Company’s first and fourth quarters due to timing of broking-related activities.Human Capital and Benefits (‘HCB’)The HCB segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for our clients. HCB is the largest segment of the Company. The segment is focused on addressing our clients’ employee and risk needs so that they can deliver sustainable employee experiences. This segment also delivers full outsourcing solutions to employers outside of the United States. The following table sets out the components of HCB revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Three Months Ended March 31,   Components of Change      As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Commissions and fees $951 $926 3% (2)% 5% —% 5%Interest and other income 4 4          Total segment revenues $955 $930          HCB total segment revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $955 million and $930 million, respectively. Commissions and fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $951 million and $926 million, 57respectively. Retirement revenues increased in the first quarter, led by Great Britain and Western Europe. The demand for actuarial consulting projects and the timing of the European Easter holiday, which was observed in the first quarter of 2016, accounted for the increase. Revenues increased in the Americas due to an increase in utilization. Talent and Rewards experienced a large drop in revenues, primarily in the Rewards, Talent and Communication consulting business in North America. The recent restructuring program impacted this region the hardest, and as expected, external marketing efforts were impacted during this initiative which resulted in a lower pipeline for the first quarter of 2017. Healthcare consulting revenues were up significantly for all markets globally. Revenue in the Technology and Administration business in Great Britain experienced growth as a result of new administration clients and project activity. Corporate Risk and Broking (‘CRB’)The CRB segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance broking and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations. The segment delivers innovative, integrated global solutions tailored to client needs and underpinned by data and analytics. CRB operates as an integrated global team comprising both functional and geographic leadership. In these operations, we have extensive specialized experience handling diverse lines of insurance coverage, including complex risk management programs. A key objective is to assist clients in reducing their overall cost of risk. The following table sets out the components of CRB revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Three Months Ended March 31,   Components of Change      As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Commissions and fees $650 $641 1% (2)% 3% —% 3%Interest and other income 5 6          Total segment revenues $655 $647          CRB total segment revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $655 million and $647 million, respectively. Commissions and fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $650 million and $641 million, respectively. International led the 2017 revenue growth, primarily due to regulatory changes, which brought forward business into the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, China and Hong Kong delivered significant new business. Western Europe also had strong organic growth, primarily in Southern Europe and France, as a result of new business wins. Great Britain grew slightly as a result of property and casualty growth and weaker comparables. North America organic revenue declined slightly, reflecting the strong first quarter in 2016, and while the pipeline is growing, there was a shortfall of contracted new business.Investment, Risk and Reinsurance (‘IRR’)The IRR segment uses a sophisticated approach to risk which helps clients free up capital and manage investment complexity. The segment works closely with investors, reinsurers and insurers to manage the equation between risk and return. Blending advanced analytics with deep institutional knowledge, IRR identifies new opportunities to maximize performance. IRR provides investment consulting services and insurance specific services and solutions through reserves opinions, software, ratemaking, usage-based insurance, risk underwriting and reinsurance broking.  The following table sets out the components of IRR revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Three Months Ended March 31,   Components of Change      As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Commissions and fees $502 $498 1% (4)% 5% —% 5%Interest and other income 5 4          Total segment revenues $507 $502          IRR total segment revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $507 million and $502 million, respectively. Commissions and fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $502 million and $498 million, respectively. Wholesale, Investment, Risk Consulting and Software, Max Mathiessen and Reinsurance all posted notable 58revenue growth, primarily as a result of strong sales and increased performance fees and timing. Portfolio Underwriting Services and WTW Securities (formerly Capital Markets) performances slightly offset the revenue growth for the segment. Exchange Solutions (‘ES’)The ES segment provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets. ES services individual populations via its ‘group to individual’ technology platform, which tightly integrates patented call routing technology, an efficient quoting and enrollment engine, a custom-developed Customer Relationship Management system and comprehensive insurance carrier connectivity. This segment also delivers group benefit exchanges and full outsourcing solutions serving the active employees of employers across the United States. ES uses Software as a Service (‘SaaS’)-based technology and related services to deliver consumer-driven healthcare and reimbursement accounts, including health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, flexible spending accounts and other consumer-directed accounts. The following table sets out the components of ES revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Three Months Ended March 31,   Components of Change      As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Commissions and fees $179 $163 10% —% 10% —% 10%Interest and other income — —          Total segment revenues $179 $163          ES total segment revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $179 million and $163 million, respectively. Retiree and Access Exchanges revenues increased by 6% and Active Exchanges revenue growth was 24%, primarily as a result of the 2017 annual enrollment season. Technology and Administration Solutions had strong revenue growth as well, as a result of obtaining new clients and higher levels of project activity.ES revenue growth is expected to slow to around 10% in 2017 due to the stabilization of the retiree enrollments. We continue to expect the active exchange growth to be strong. Costs of Providing Services Total costs of providing services for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $1.9 billion, compared to $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $52 million, or 3%. This decrease was due primarily to reductions in other operating expenses, amortization and integration costs. See the analysis below for further information. Salaries and benefitsSalaries and benefits for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $1.2 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $5 million. Additionally, salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue decreased from 54% to 51% since we were able to grow our revenue while maintaining our salaries and benefits costs. Salaries and benefits costs remained stable during the quarter with decreased share-based compensation expense, and additional net pension credits being offset by additional discretionary compensation accruals.Other operating expensesOther operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $401 million, compared to $431 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $30 million, or 7%. This decrease was due primarily to the Stanford litigation provision of $50 million in the first quarter of 2016. This $50 million reduction was partially offset by reserves for CalPERS and other increases in litigation reserves. As result of these cost reductions, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 19% to 17%. Depreciation Depreciation for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $46 million, compared to $43 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $3 million, or 7%. This increase was due primarily to additional assets placed in service during 2016. The depreciation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was consistent with our depreciation expense for the three months ended December 31, 2016. 59Amortization Amortization for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $151 million, compared to $161 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $10 million, or 6%. This decrease occurred because the preliminary estimate of the fair value of intangible assets resulting from the Merger and the Gras Savoye acquisition was higher in the first quarter of 2016 than the final values recorded once purchase accounting was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles, and therefore amortization for these two acquisitions will continue to decrease over time. Restructuring costs Restructuring costs for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $27 million, compared to $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $2 million, or 8%. These costs were incurred entirely for the Operational Improvement Program, for which the Company expects to incur $130 million of restructuring costs during fiscal year 2017, the final year of the program, bringing the cumulative restructuring charges for this program to approximately $440 million. Refer to Part 1, Item 1, Note 5 — Restructuring Costs for additional information regarding these costs.Integration expenses Integration expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $40 million, compared to $52 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $12 million, or 23%. These reductions in expenses were driven by decreased spending on certain consulting, severance and transaction-related costs that were incurred initially as part of the Merger, offset by additional non-capitalizable costs incurred related to the integration of finance, information technology and human resources systems and processes. Income from Operations Income from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $463 million, compared to $326 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $137 million, or 42%. This increase resulted from increased revenue of $85 million coupled with reductions to total costs of providing services of $52 million.Interest Expense Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $46 million, which was flat compared to the prior year period.Other Expense, Net Other expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $20 million, compared to $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $2 million, or 11%. This increase was due primarily to the impact of foreign exchange hedging contracts.Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $46 million, compared to $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The effective tax rate was 11.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 6.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our effective tax rate is low as compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. This is primarily due to our global mix of income, which creates deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was higher than the rate for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to the U.S. tax expense resulting from an internal reorganization of certain legacy Towers Watson businesses.Net Income Attributable to Willis Towers WatsonNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $344 million, compared to $238 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $106 million, or 45%. This increase resulted from additional income from operations of $137 million partially offset by additional tax expense resulting from an internal reorganization of certain legacy Towers Watson businesses.60Liquidity and Capital ResourcesExecutive SummaryOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings. Based on our balance sheets, combined cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that Willis Towers Watson has sufficient liquidity, which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in the business for growth, creating value through the integration of Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments, and contemplated share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. Historically, we have not provided deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of our subsidiaries that have been reinvested indefinitely. As a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired Towers Watson foreign operations, we continue to accrue deferred taxes on current year earnings of those subsidiaries. However, we assert that the historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries are reinvested indefinitely, and therefore do not provide deferred tax liabilities on these amounts. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, long-term investment requirements or U.S. tax reform necessitate that additional earnings be distributed, an incremental provision for income and foreign withholding taxes, net of credits, may be necessary. Other potential sources of cash may be through settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a tax-efficient manner. Events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results, potential future acquisitions or divestitures, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters, or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets. In March 2017, we entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility replacing our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings against the $1.25 billion facility of $409 million and €45 million were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the $800 million facility and the 7-year term loan due July 23, 2018.Also in March 2017, the Company repaid the 6.200% senior notes due 2017 totaling $407 million, including accrued interest.The Company is considering a long-term debt financing in the near term to refinance certain items, including amounts currently drawn on the revolving credit facility. We anticipate this refinancing will include raising funds of up to $700 million. Any such refinancing is dependent on the market and other conditions at the time. Assets and liabilities associated with non-U.S. entities have been translated into U.S. dollars as of March 31, 2017 at U.S. dollar rates that fluctuate compared to historical periods. As a result, cash flows derived from changes in the condensed consolidated balance sheets include the impact of the change in foreign exchange translation rates.Cash and Short-term InvestmentsOur cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2017 totaled $901 million, compared to $870 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in cash from December 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017 was due primarily to cash flows from operations offset by fixed asset and software additions.Additionally, $182 million was available to draw against our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility as compared to $557 million, which was available to draw against our previous $800 million revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016. Included within cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2017 are amounts held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements, including $88 million held within our regulated U.K. entities for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.61Summarized Condensed Consolidated Cash FlowsThe following table presents the summarized consolidated cash flow information for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)Net cash from/(used in):    Operating activities$95 $119 Investing activities(82) 417 Financing activities14 (116)INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS27 420Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents4 2CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, BEGINNING OF PERIOD870 532CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, END OF PERIOD$901 $954Cash Flows From Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities were $95 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $119 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The $95 million net cash from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included net income of $352 million, adjusted for $119 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $376 million. The decrease in cash flows from operations in 2017 primarily resulted from increased revenues that have not yet been collected. The $119 million of cash flows from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 included net income of $245 million and $164 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $290 million. Cash Flows (Used In)/From Investing ActivitiesCash flows used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $82 million, driven primarily by capital expenditures and capitalized software costs.Cash flows from investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were $417 million, driven primarily by $476 million of cash acquired as a result of the Merger, which was a non-cash transaction as it was consummated through the issuance of shares. We also redeemed certain investments resulting in cash inflows of $20 million, which were offset by fixed asset purchases and capitalized costs of developing internal and external software totaling $66 million. Cash Flows From/(Used In) Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $14 million. The significant financing activities included net borrowings of $219 million, which were offset by share repurchases of $156 million and dividend payments of $65 million. Cash flows used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were $116 million, driven primarily by debt repayments of $1.5 billion, partially offset by debt issuances of $1.4 billion. No dividend was paid during the three months ended March 31, 2016, as the fourth quarter 2015 dividend was accelerated and paid during December 2015, prior to completion of the Merger.62IndebtednessTotal debt, total equity, and the capitalization ratio at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows:  March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 ($ in millions)Long-term debt$3,975 $3,357Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt120 508Total debt$4,095 $3,865    Total Willis Towers Watson shareholders’ equity$10,278 $10,065    Capitalization ratio28.5% 27.7%At March 31, 2017, our material mandatory debt repayments over the next twelve months include scheduled repayments of $85 million on our term loan maturing in 2019 and $35 million on other debt.At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. Fiduciary FundsAs an intermediary, we hold funds, generally in a fiduciary capacity, for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities on our balance sheets.Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had fiduciary funds of $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Share Repurchase ProgramThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. At March 31, 2017, approximately $978 million remained on the current open-ended repurchase authority. The maximum number of shares that could be repurchased based on the closing price of our Ordinary Shares on March 31, 2017 of $130.89 was 7,464,222. The Company intends to repurchase up to $978 million in Company shares during the remainder of 2017 and 2018.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company had the following share repurchase activity: Three Months Ended  March 31, 2017Shares repurchased1,236,589Average price per share$126.24Aggregate repurchase cost (excluding broker costs)$156 millionCapital CommitmentsCapital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use were $62 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company estimates that such expenditures will be approximately $188 million during the remainder of 2017. We expect cash from operations to adequately provide for these cash needs. There have been no material changes to our capital commitments since December 31, 2016.63DividendsTotal cash dividends of $65 million were paid during the three months ended March 31, 2017. In February 2017, the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.53 per share ($2.12 per share annualized rate), which was paid on April 17, 2017.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsOff-Balance Sheet TransactionsSee Part II, Item 7. ‘Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017, for a discussion pertaining to off-balance sheet transactions.Contractual ObligationsOperating Leases. We lease office space and furniture under operating lease agreements with terms typically ranging from three to twenty years. We have determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year. Consequently, management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense on leases will be mainly market-driven. We also lease cars and selected computer equipment under operating lease agreements. For acquired operating leases, intangible assets or liabilities have been recognized for the differences between the contractual cash obligations and the estimated market rates at the time of acquisition. These intangibles are amortized to rent expense but do not affect our contractual cash obligations. There have been no material changes to our operating lease obligations since we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on March 1, 2017.Material changes to our other contractual obligations since we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on March 1, 2017, are discussed in Note 9 — Debt and Note 11 — Retirement Benefits.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn order to assist readers of our condensed consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that Willis Towers Watson’s management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes, we present the following non-GAAP measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure: Most Directly Comparable U.S. GAAP MeasureNon-GAAP MeasureTotal revenuesAdjusted revenuesAs reported changeConstant currency changeAs reported changeOrganic changeIncome from operationsAdjusted operating incomeNet incomeAdjusted EBITDANet income attributable to Willis Towers WatsonAdjusted net incomeDiluted earnings per shareAdjusted diluted earnings per shareIncome from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associatesAdjusted income before taxesProvision for income taxes/U.S. GAAP tax rateAdjusted income taxes/tax rateNet cash from operating activitiesFree cash flowThe Company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results. Within these measures, we have adjusted for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include the following:•Restructuring costs and integration expenses - Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and integration expenses when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when these programs will have concluded. 64•Fair value adjustment to deferred revenue - Adjustment in 2016 to normalize for the deferred revenue written down as part of the purchase accounting for the Merger. •Gains and losses on disposals of operations - Adjustment to remove the results of disposed operations.•Provision for Stanford litigation - The 2016 provision for the Stanford litigation matter, which we consider to be a non-ordinary course litigation matter. •Tax effects of internal reorganization - Relates to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain businesses that reduced the investments held by our U.S.-controlled subsidiaries.These non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our condensed consolidated financial statements. Adjusted Revenues We consider adjusted revenues to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. Adjusted revenues is defined as total revenues adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenues that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions. U.S. GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue. We have included the reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues in the table below, together with our reconciliation of the revenues change to the constant currency and organic changes. Constant Currency Change and Organic Change We evaluate our revenues on an as reported (U.S. GAAP), constant currency and organic basis. We believe providing constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally. •Constant currency change - Represents the year over year change in revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenues, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenues, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.•Organic change - The organic presentation excludes both the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as described above, as well as the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that excluding transaction-related items from our U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors, and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not incurred these transaction-related items, since the nature, size and number of these transaction-related items can vary from period to period. The constant currency and organic change results, and a reconciliation from the reported results for consolidated revenues are included in the Financial Statement Overview section within this Form 10-Q. These measures are also reported by segment in the Segment Revenues section within this Form 10-Q. 65A reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and a reconciliation of the reported change to the constant currency and organic changes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is as follows:  Three Months Ended March 31,   Components of Revenue Change(i)      Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Total revenues $2,319 $2,234 4% (2)% 6% —% 6%Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue — 32          Adjusted revenues $2,319 $2,266 2% (2)% 5% —% 5%__________________________i.Components of the adjusted revenue change may not recalculate to the constant currency change presented due to rounding.Adjusted Operating IncomeWe consider adjusted operating income to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. Adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.A reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)Income from operations$463 $326Adjusted for certain items:   Amortization151 161Restructuring costs27 25Integration expenses40 52Provision for the Stanford litigation— 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 32Adjusted operating income$681 $646Adjusted operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $681 million, compared to $646 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. While our income from operations increased by $137 million, certain increases in revenue or cost reductions in 2017 were as a result of non-core adjustments during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Adjusting for these items, our adjusted operating income increased by $35 million, largely due to additional client demand partially offset by increases in normal litigation reserves. Adjusted EBITDAWe consider adjusted EBITDA to be an important financial measure, which is used internally to evaluate and assess our core operations, to benchmark our operating results against our competitors, and to evaluate and measure our performance-based compensation plans.Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.66A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in millions)NET INCOME$352 $245Provision for income taxes46 18Interest expense46 46Depreciation46 43Amortization151 161Restructuring costs27 25Integration expenses40 52Provision for the Stanford litigation— 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 32Gain on disposal of operations— (1)Adjusted EBITDA$708 $671Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $708 million, compared to $671 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. As noted above, while our income from operations increased by $137 million, certain increases in revenue or reductions to costs in 2017 were as a result of non-core adjustments during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Adjusting for these items, our adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million, largely due to additional client demand partially offset by increases in normal litigation reserves.Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAdjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, diluted. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. 67A reconciliation of net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 ($ in millions)NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO WILLIS TOWERS WATSON$344 $238Adjusted for certain items (i):   Amortization151 161Restructuring costs27 25Integration expenses40 52Provision for the Stanford litigation— 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 32Gain on disposal of operations— (1)Tax effect on certain items listed above(ii)(69) (93)Tax effects of internal reorganization19 —Adjusted net income$512 $464    Weighted average shares of common stock — diluted 138 136    Diluted earnings per share $2.50 $1.75Adjusted for certain items(i):   Amortization1.09 1.18Restructuring costs0.19 0.18Integration expenses0.29 0.38Provision for the Stanford litigation— 0.37Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 0.24Gain on disposal of operations— (0.01)Tax effect on certain items listed above(ii)(0.50) (0.68)Tax effects of internal reorganization0.14 —Adjusted diluted earnings per share$3.71 $3.41 __________________________i.In the second quarter of 2016, Willis Towers Watson changed the manner in which adjusted items are presented in the reconciliation of adjusted net income. This change resulted in adjusted items being presented on a pretax basis and the related tax impacts on adjusted items being aggregated into a separate line item. The adjusted items for the prior period presented were conformed to the current period presentation.ii.The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.As noted above, in analyzing both our adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA, the Company experienced additional client demand during the quarter, partially offset by increases in normal litigation reserves. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share benefited from this growth. Adjusted Income Before Taxes and Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax RateAdjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.Adjusted income taxes/tax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain on disposal of operations, tax effects of internal reorganization and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-68period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.Management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items and the tax effects of our internal reorganization, which are not core to our current and future operations.A reconciliation of income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates to adjusted income and provision for income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 ($ in millions)INCOME FROM OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND INTEREST IN EARNINGS OF ASSOCIATES$397 $262Adjusted for certain items:   Amortization151 161Restructuring costs27 25Integration expenses40 52Provision for the Stanford litigation— 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 32Gain on disposal of operations— (1)Adjusted income before taxes$615 $581    Provision for income taxes$46 $18Tax effect on certain items listed above69 94Tax effects of internal reorganization(19) —Adjusted income taxes$96 $112    U.S. GAAP tax rate11.6% 6.9%Adjusted income tax rate15.6% 19.3%During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we recorded certain tax adjustments of $19 million which relate to U.S. income tax expense resulting from an internal reorganization of certain legacy Towers Watson businesses that reduced the investments held by our U.S.-controlled non-U.S. subsidiaries. The $19 million tax expense was recorded in the provision for income taxes in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income for March 31, 2017.Our U.S. GAAP tax rate is lower (11.6% and 6.9%  at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) as compared to the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%. This is primarily due to our global mix of income which creates deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates. After adjusting for the impact of non-core 2016 adjustments, intangible amortization and tax resulting from an internal reorganization in 2017, our adjusted income tax rates were 15.6% and 19.3% at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The adjusted tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is lower than that for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to the additional realization of deferred tax benefits. Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use and is used to evaluate our liquidity.69A reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016(i) (in millions)Cash flows from operating activities$95 $119Less: Additions to fixed assets and software for internal use(62) (48)Free cash flow$33 $71__________________________i.As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 increased by $1 million, increasing free cash flow by the same amount. See Part I, Item 1. Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements of this Form 10-Q report for a further discussion of this changeThe decrease in both cash flows from operations and free cash flows in 2017 primarily resulted from increased revenues that have not yet been collected. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThere were no material changes from the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017.ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe have considered changes in our exposure to market risks during the three months ended March 31, 2017, including additional exposures to market risks as a consequence of the Merger, and have determined that there have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks from those described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017.ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs of March 31, 2017, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) and the Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Exchange Act 70Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that the information required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere have been no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Limitations on the Effectiveness of ControlsManagement, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud. However, management does expect that the control system provides reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. In addition, the design of such internal controls must take into account the costs of designing and maintaining such a control system. Certain inherent limitations exist in control systems to make absolute assurances difficult, including the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake, and that individuals can circumvent controls. The design of any control system is based in part upon existing business conditions and risk assessments. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. As a result, they may require change or revision. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. Nevertheless, the disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.71PART II.
