Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017. Typically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We believe that the U.K. has good long-term growth opportunities and, given that, we believe the impact to Willis Towers Watson will be neutral to slightly positive over the next few years, with some periods of increase and decrease in that time frame. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change. On an annual basis for 2017, although we expect that approximately 22% of our revenues will be generated in the U.K., we expect that only about 12% of revenues will be denominated in Pounds sterling, as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. We expect that approximately 19% of our expenses will be denominated in Pounds sterling; thus, we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency. The markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and private exchange services are subject to changes as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth.See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017 for a discussion of risks that may affect our ability to compete. Financial Statement OverviewThe table below sets forth our summarized condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated.

Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, our revenue grew by 2%.Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $4.3 billion, compared to $4.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $89 million or 2%. The $89 million increase in revenues was driven mainly by Human Capital and Benefits, which had strong demand and increased utilization, and Exchange Solutions, offset by negative foreign currency translation. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, our revenue grew by 4%. 63Our revenues can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenues by $43 million and $93 million, respectively. The primary currencies driving the change were the Pound sterling and the Euro. The following table details our top five markets based on the percentage of consolidated revenues (in U.S. dollars) from the countries where work is performed for the six months ended June 30, 2017. These figures do not represent the currency of the related revenue, which is presented in the next table.Geographic Region% of RevenuesUnited States48%United Kingdom22%France6%Germany3%Canada3%The table below details the percentage of our revenues and expenses by transactional currency for the six months ended June 30, 2017.

These items include Merger-related amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, and integration expenses. The components of the change in revenues generated for the three month and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:  Three Months Ended June 30,   Components of Revenue Change  2017 2016 As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  ($ in millions)     Total revenues $1,953 $1,949 —% (2)% 2% —% 2%  Six Months Ended June 30,   Components of Revenue Change  2017 2016 As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  ($ in millions)     Total revenues $4,272 $4,183 2% (2)% 4% —% 4%Definitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included under the section entitled Non-GAAP Financial Measures elsewhere within Item 2 of this Form 10-Q. Segment RevenuesBeginning in 2017, we made certain changes that affect our segment results. These changes, which are detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017, include the realignment of certain businesses within our segments, as well as changes to certain allocation methodologies to better reflect the ongoing nature of our businesses. The prior period comparatives reflected in the tables below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect our current segment presentation. See Part I, Item 1. Note 4 — Segment Information of this Form 10-Q report for a further discussion of these changes.The segment descriptions below should be read in conjunction with the full descriptions of our businesses contained in Part I, Item 1. Business, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017, as updated by the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 7, 2017.The Company experiences seasonal fluctuations of its commissions and fees revenue. Revenue is typically higher during the Company’s first and fourth quarters due primarily to timing of broking-related activities.64Human Capital and Benefits (‘HCB’)The HCB segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for our clients. HCB is the largest segment of the Company. The segment is focused on addressing our clients’ employee and risk needs so that they can deliver sustainable employee experiences. This segment also delivers full outsourcing solutions to employers outside of the United States. The following table sets forth the components of HCB revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from the three months ended June 30, 2016.

Commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $718 million and $731 million, respectively. Retirement revenues decreased in the second quarter as Great Britain and International revenue growth was offset by an expected decline in North America, as bulk lump sum projects declined year-over-year, and in Western Europe due to the timing of the Easter holiday. The demand for actuarial consulting projects remained strong in Great Britain as a result of regulatory change. Talent and Rewards was down slightly as the 2016 North America restructuring led to anticipated softness in new business, but the margin enhancement objectives were achieved. Health and Benefits continued to experience strong revenue growth as a result of health care consulting in North America, offset by softness in Western Europe due to timing issues. Revenue in the Technology and Administration Solutions business experienced growth in all regions as a result of new administration clients and project activity. The change in interest and other income was a result of a $5 million settlement received during the second quarter of 2017 related to the loss of a team in Florida.The following table sets forth the components of HCB revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from the six months ended June 30, 2016.      Components of Revenue Change  Six Months Ended June 30, As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Commissions and fees $1,669 $1,657 1% (2)% 3% —% 3%Interest and other income 15 9          Total segment revenues $1,684 $1,666          HCB commissions and fees, and total segment revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $1.7 billion. Retirement revenues decreased in the first half of the year. The decrease occurred in Western Europe, International and North America and was partially offset by growth in Great Britain. The decline in North America was expected as bulk lump sum projects declined year over year. Actuarial consulting projects in Great Britain were strong due to regulation changes. Talent and Rewards experienced a large drop in revenues, primarily in the Rewards, Talent and Communication consulting business in North America. The recent restructuring program impacted this region the hardest, and as expected, external marketing efforts were impacted during this initiative which resulted in a lower pipeline for the first half of 2017. Healthcare consulting revenues were up significantly for all markets globally. Revenue in the Technology and Administration Solutions business in Great Britain experienced growth as a result of new administration clients and project activity. The change in interest and other income was a result of a $5 million settlement received during the second quarter of 2017 related to the loss of a team in Florida.65Corporate Risk and Broking (‘CRB’)The CRB segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance broking and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations. The segment delivers innovative, integrated global solutions tailored to client needs and underpinned by data and analytics. CRB operates as an integrated global team comprising both functional and geographic leadership. In these operations, we have extensive specialized experience handling diverse lines of insurance coverage, including complex risk management programs. A key objective is to assist clients in reducing their overall cost of risk. The following table sets forth the components of CRB revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from the three months ended June 30, 2016.

Commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $624 million and $627 million, respectively. Western Europe, Great Britain and International had solid revenue growth. Western Europe revenue growth was led by Iberia and Ireland. Great Britain experienced growth in Transportation, Financial Lines and Natural Resources, with some timing offsets from the first quarter. International revenue growth was led by the Asian and Latin American operations. North America organic revenues were flat as new business growth was offset by a decline in one-time projects versus the second quarter of 2016. The following table sets forth the components of CRB revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from the six months ended June 30, 2016.

Revenue growth was led by International with additional growth in Western Europe and Great Britain offset by a slight decline in North America. International growth was fueled by solid client retention and very strong new business. Western Europe had strong client retention and modest new business growth. Great Britain experienced solid new business growth and North America experienced a small decline driven by lower than historic one-time project revenues somewhat offset by improved client retention.Investment, Risk and Reinsurance (‘IRR’)The IRR segment uses a sophisticated approach to risk which helps clients free up capital and manage investment complexity. The segment works closely with investors, reinsurers and insurers to manage the equation between risk and return. Blending advanced analytics with deep institutional knowledge, IRR identifies new opportunities to maximize performance. IRR 66provides investment consulting services and insurance specific services and solutions through reserves opinions, software, ratemaking, usage-based insurance, risk underwriting and reinsurance broking.  The following table sets forth the components of IRR revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from the three months ended June 30, 2016.

Total segment revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included £28 million ($41 million) received for a settlement related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team. Commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $383 million and $380 million, respectively. Reinsurance, Investment, Risk Consulting and Software, and Max Matthiessen all posted revenue growth, primarily as a result of strong sales and increased performance fees. As expected, Wholesale revenues declined due to timing of renewals, which brought revenue forward into the first quarter of 2017. The following table sets forth the components of IRR revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from the six months ended June 30, 2016.

Commissions and fees for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $885 million and $878 million, respectively. Wholesale, Investment, Risk Consulting and Software, Max Matthiessen and Reinsurance all posted notable revenue growth, primarily as a result of strong sales and increased performance fees and timing. WTW Securities (formerly Capital Markets) performance slightly offset the revenue growth for the segment. Exchange Solutions (‘ES’)The ES segment provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets. ES services individual populations via its ‘group to individual’ technology platform, which tightly integrates patented call routing technology, an efficient quoting and enrollment engine, a custom-developed Customer Relationship Management system and comprehensive insurance carrier connectivity. This segment also delivers group benefit exchanges and full outsourcing solutions serving the active employees of employers across the United States. ES uses Software as a Service (‘SaaS’)-based technology and related services to deliver consumer-driven healthcare and reimbursement accounts, including health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, flexible spending accounts and other consumer-directed accounts. 67The following table sets forth the components of ES revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from the three months ended June 30, 2016.      Components of Revenue Change  Three Months Ended June 30, As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Commissions and fees $178 $154 15% —% 15% —% 15%Interest and other income — 1          Total segment revenues $178 $155          ES total segment revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $178 million and $155 million, respectively. Retiree and Access Exchanges revenues increased by 14% and Exchange Solutions Other grew by 17%, led by active exchanges and Technology and Administration Solutions. The following table sets forth the components of ES revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the components of the change in commissions and fees for the six months ended June 30, 2017 from the six months ended June 30, 2016.      Components of Revenue Change  Six Months Ended June 30, As Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Commissions and fees $357 $317 13% —% 13% —% 13%Interest and other income — 1          Total segment revenues $357 $318          ES total segment revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 were $357 million and $318 million, respectively. Retiree and Access Exchanges revenues increased by 10% and Exchange Solutions Other grew by 16%, led by active exchanges and Technology and Administration Solutions. ES revenue growth is expected to slow to around 10% in 2017 due to the stabilization of the retiree enrollments. We continue to expect the active exchange growth to be strong. Costs of Providing Services Total costs of providing services were flat for both the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 at $1.8 billion, as well as for both the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 at $3.7 billion. See the analysis below for further information. Salaries and benefitsSalaries and benefits for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $1.1 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $53 million. Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue decreased from 62% to 59% for the quarter. Salaries and benefits for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $2.3 billion, compared to $2.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $58 million. Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue decreased from 57% to 55% for the first half of the year. Salaries and benefits costs decreased during both the quarter and the first half of 2017 due to savings associated with our integration and restructuring plans, stemming from reduced headcount and shifting work to lower-cost locations. Salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue decreased as we were able to grow our revenue while reducing our salaries and benefits costs. Other operating expensesOther operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $391 million, compared to $373 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $18 million, or 5%. This $18 million increase was due primarily to increased spending on non-reimbursable costs to deliver health-reimbursement account (‘HRA’) services, legal fees and IT related services. As a result of these cost increases, other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 19% to 20%. 68Other operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $792 million, compared to $804 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $12 million, or 1%. This $12 million decrease was due primarily to the Stanford litigation provision of $50 million in the first half of 2016, partially offset by reserves for the CalPERS litigation and other increases in litigation reserves and other professional services. Other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat at 19%. Depreciation Depreciation for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $51 million, compared to $44 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $7 million, or 16%. Depreciation for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $97 million, compared to $87 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $10 million, or 11%. This increase was due primarily to a higher depreciable base of assets resulting from additional assets placed in service during 2016. Amortization Amortization for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $149 million, compared to $125 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $24 million, or 19%. Amortization for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $300 million, compared to $286 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $14 million, or 5%. This increase occurred because the preliminary estimates of the fair value of intangible assets arising from the Merger were lower in the second quarter of 2016 than the final values recorded once purchase accounting was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles, and therefore amortization will decrease over time. Restructuring costs Restructuring costs for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $27 million, compared to $41 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $14 million, or 34%. Restructuring costs for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $54 million, compared to $66 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $12 million, or 18%. These costs were incurred primarily in connection with the Operational Improvement Program, for which the Company expects to incur $130 million of restructuring costs during 2017, the final year of the program, bringing the cumulative restructuring charges for this program to approximately $440 million. Refer to Part 1, Item 1, Note 5 — Restructuring Costs for additional information regarding these costs.Integration expenses Integration expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $63 million, compared to $29 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $34 million, or 117%. The increase in expenses primarily relates to costs associated with our enterprise resource planning (‘ERP’) migration and real estate consolidations.Integration expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $103 million, compared to $81 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $22 million, or 27%. The increase in expenses was driven by the ERP migration, including accelerated depreciation related to the planned decommissioning of certain Legacy Willis accounting systems, and real estate consolidations, partially offset by decreased spending on certain consulting, severance and transaction-related costs that were incurred initially as part of the Merger.Income from Operations Income from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $124 million, compared to $136 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $12 million, or 9%. This decrease resulted from an increase to total costs of providing services of $16 million, partially offset by increased revenue of $4 million.Income from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $587 million, compared to $462 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $125 million, or 27%. This increase resulted from additional revenue of $89 million coupled with reductions to total costs of providing services of $36 million.Interest Expense Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $46 million, compared to $47 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 a decrease of $1 million, or 2%. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $92 million, compared to $93 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $1 million, or 1%. The decrease in interest 69expense resulted primarily from a lower weighted-average cost of financing, partially offset by an increase in total debt outstanding. However, we expect our interest expense to increase further over the remainder of the year, given the expected increase in the Federal Funds rate. Other Expense/(Income), Net Other expense/(income), net for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was expense of $30 million, compared to income of $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase to expense of $36 million. Other expense/(income), net for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was expense of $50 million, compared to expense of $12 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $38 million, or 317%. The additional expense in 2017 as compared to the prior year related to the impact of foreign exchange hedging contracts, unfavorable balance sheet remeasurement and further devaluation of the Venezuelan currency.Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $8 million, compared to $19 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $11 million, or 58%. The effective tax rate was 16.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and 20.6% for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Our effective tax rate is generally lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. This is primarily due to our global mix of income, which creates deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates. The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was lower than the rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to the release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of the completion of a U.S. Internal Revenue Service examination for Towers Watson & Co.’s short tax period from July 1, 2015 to January 4, 2016. The Company is no longer in the Compliance Assurance Process program.Provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $54 million, compared to $37 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $17 million, or 46%. The effective tax rate was 12.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and 10.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was higher than the rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to the U.S. tax expense resulting from an internal reorganization of certain legacy Towers Watson businesses. Net Income Attributable to Willis Towers WatsonNet income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $33 million, compared to $72 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, a decrease of $39 million, or 54%. This decrease resulted from lower income from operations of $12 million as well as the impact of foreign exchange hedging contracts and unfavorable balance sheet remeasurement. Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $377 million, compared to $310 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $67 million, or 22%. This $67 million increase resulted from additional income from operations of $125 million, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange hedging contracts, unfavorable balance sheet remeasurement and additional tax expense resulting from an internal reorganization of certain legacy Towers Watson businesses.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesExecutive SummaryOur principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities or new debt offerings. Based on our balance sheets, combined cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that Willis Towers Watson has sufficient liquidity, which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in the business for growth, creating value through the integration of Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments, and contemplated share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. Historically, we have not provided deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of our subsidiaries that have been reinvested indefinitely. As a result of our plan to restructure or distribute accumulated earnings of certain acquired Towers Watson foreign operations, we continue to accrue deferred taxes on current year earnings of those subsidiaries. However, we assert that the historical cumulative earnings of our other subsidiaries are reinvested indefinitely, and therefore do not provide deferred tax liabilities on these amounts. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, long-term investment requirements or U.S. tax reform necessitate that additional earnings be distributed, an incremental provision for 70income and foreign withholding taxes, net of credits, may be necessary. Other potential sources of cash may be through settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a tax-efficient manner. Events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results, potential future acquisitions or divestitures, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters, or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets. In May 2017, we completed an offering of $650 million of 3.600% Senior Notes due 2024. Net proceeds of $644 million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.In March 2017, we entered into a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility replacing our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings against the $1.25 billion facility of $409 million and €45 million were used to repay all outstanding borrowings against the $800 million facility and the 7-year term loan due July 23, 2018.Additionally in March 2017, the Company repaid the 6.200% senior notes due 2017 totaling $407 million, including accrued interest.Assets and liabilities associated with non-U.S. entities have been translated into U.S. dollars as of June 30, 2017 at U.S. dollar rates that fluctuate compared to historical periods. As a result, cash flows derived from changes in the condensed consolidated balance sheets include the impact of the change in foreign exchange translation rates.Cash and Cash EquivalentsOur cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2017 totaled $852 million, compared to $870 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease in cash from December 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017 was due primarily to fixed asset and software additions, dividends and repurchases of stock, partially offset by cash flows from operations and additional net borrowings.Additionally, at June 30, 2017, $722 million was available to draw against our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility as compared to $557 million, which was available to draw against our previous $800 million revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016. Included within cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are amounts held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements, including $89 million and $87 million, respectively, held within our regulated U.K. entities for regulatory capital adequacy requirements.Summarized Condensed Consolidated Cash FlowsThe following table presents the summarized consolidated cash flow information for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 (in millions)Net cash from/(used in):    Operating activities$319 $436 Investing activities(155) 308 Financing activities(196) (324)(DECREASE)/INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS(32) 420Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents14 (3)CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, BEGINNING OF PERIOD870 532CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, END OF PERIOD$852 $949Cash Flows From Operating ActivitiesCash flows from operating activities were $319 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $436 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The $319 million net cash from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 included net income of $393 million, adjusted for $337 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $411 million. The decrease in cash flows from operations in 2017 primarily resulted from changes in working capital and higher discretionary compensation payments made 71in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. These discretionary compensation payments were lower in 2016 because they included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger. The $436 million of cash flows from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included net income of $321 million and $353 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $238 million. Cash Flows (Used In)/From Investing ActivitiesCash flows used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $155 million, driven primarily by capital expenditures and capitalized software costs.Cash flows from investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $308 million, driven primarily by $476 million of cash acquired as a result of the Merger, which was a non-cash transaction as it was consummated through the issuance of shares. We also redeemed certain investments resulting in cash inflows of $22 million, which were offset by fixed asset purchases and capitalized costs of developing internal and external software totaling $134 million. Cash Flows Used In Financing ActivitiesCash flows used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $196 million. The significant financing activities included net borrowings of $261 million as well as $37 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares, which were more than offset by share repurchases of $296 million and dividend payments of $137 million. Cash flows used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $324 million, driven primarily by debt issuance of $2.0 billion, debt repayments of $1.8 billion, net payments on the revolving credit facility of $393 million, dividend payments of $67 million, and share repurchases of $38 million.  IndebtednessTotal debt, total equity, and the capitalization ratio at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were as follows:  June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 ($ in millions)Long-term debt$4,097 $3,357Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt85 508Total debt$4,182 $3,865    Total Willis Towers Watson shareholders’ equity$10,263 $10,065    Capitalization ratio29.0% 27.7%At June 30, 2017, our material mandatory debt repayments over the next twelve months include scheduled repayments of $85 million on our term loan maturing in 2019.At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. Fiduciary FundsAs an intermediary, we hold funds, generally in a fiduciary capacity, for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities on our balance sheets.Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned 72on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had fiduciary funds of $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Share Repurchase ProgramThe Company is authorized to repurchase shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. At June 30, 2017, approximately $837 million remained on the current repurchase authority. The maximum number of shares that could be repurchased based on the closing price of our Ordinary Shares on June 30, 2017 of $145.46 was 5,756,291. The Company intends to use the remaining authority to repurchase up to $837 million in Company shares during the remainder of 2017 and 2018. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company had the following share repurchase activity: Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Six Months Ended June 30, 2017Shares repurchased1,001,248 2,237,837Average price per share$139.51 $132.18Aggregate repurchase cost (excluding broker costs)$140 million $296 millionCapital CommitmentsCapital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use were $119 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017. The Company estimates that such expenditures will be approximately $130 million during the remainder of 2017. We expect cash from operations to adequately provide for these cash needs. There have been no material changes to our capital commitments since December 31, 2016.DividendsTotal cash dividends of $137 million were paid during the six months ended June 30, 2017. In May, 2017, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.53 per share ($2.12 per share annualized rate), which was paid on July 17, 2017 to shareholders of record as of June 30, 2017.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsOff-Balance Sheet TransactionsSee Part II, Item 7. ‘Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations’ in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017, for a discussion pertaining to off-balance sheet transactions.Contractual ObligationsOperating Leases. We lease office space and furniture under operating lease agreements with terms typically ranging from three to twenty years. We have determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year. Consequently, management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense on leases will be mainly market-driven. We also lease cars and selected computer equipment under operating lease agreements. For acquired operating leases, intangible assets or liabilities have been recognized for the differences between the contractual cash obligations and the estimated market rates at the time of acquisition. These intangibles are amortized to rent expense but do not affect our contractual cash obligations. There have been no material changes to our operating lease obligations since we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on March 1, 2017.Material changes to our other contractual obligations since we filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on March 1, 2017, are discussed in Note 9 — Debt and Note 11 — Retirement Benefits.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn order to assist readers of our condensed consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that Willis Towers Watson’s management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes, we present the following non-GAAP measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure: 73Most Directly Comparable U.S. GAAP MeasureNon-GAAP MeasureTotal revenuesAdjusted revenuesAs reported changeConstant currency changeAs reported changeOrganic changeIncome from operationsAdjusted operating incomeNet incomeAdjusted EBITDANet income attributable to Willis Towers WatsonAdjusted net incomeDiluted earnings per shareAdjusted diluted earnings per shareIncome from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associatesAdjusted income before taxesProvision for income taxes/U.S. GAAP tax rateAdjusted income taxes/tax rateNet cash from operating activitiesFree cash flowThe Company believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results. Within these measures, we have adjusted for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include the following:•Restructuring costs and integration expenses - Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and integration expenses when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when these programs will have concluded. •Fair value adjustment to deferred revenue - Adjustment in 2016 to normalize for the deferred revenue written down as part of the purchase accounting for the Merger. •Gains and losses on disposals of operations - Adjustment to remove the results of disposed operations.•Provision for Stanford litigation - The 2016 provision for the Stanford litigation matter, which we consider to be a non-ordinary course litigation matter. •Venezuelan currency devaluation - Foreign exchange losses incurred as a consequence of the Venezuelan government’s enforced changes to exchange rate mechanisms. •Tax effects of internal reorganization - Relates to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the completion of an internal reorganization of the ownership of certain businesses that reduced the investments held by our U.S.-controlled subsidiaries.These non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our condensed consolidated financial statements. Adjusted Revenues We consider adjusted revenues to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. Adjusted revenues is defined as total revenues adjusted for the fair value adjustment for deferred revenues that would otherwise have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions. U.S. GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue. We have included the reconciliation of total revenues to adjusted revenues in the table below, together with our reconciliation of the revenues change to the constant currency and organic changes. 74Constant Currency Change and Organic Change We evaluate our revenues on an as reported (U.S. GAAP), constant currency and organic basis. We believe providing constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally. •Constant currency change - Represents the year over year change in revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenues, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenues, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets.•Organic change - The organic presentation excludes both the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as described above, as well as the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that excluding transaction-related items from our U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors, and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not incurred these transaction-related items, since the nature, size and number of these transaction-related items can vary from period to period. The constant currency and organic change results, and a reconciliation from the reported results for consolidated revenues are included in the Consolidated Revenues section within this Form 10-Q. These measures are also reported by segment in the Segment Revenues section within this Form 10-Q. Reconciliations of total revenues to adjusted revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, and reconciliations of the reported changes to the constant currency and organic changes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 are as follows:      Components of Revenue Change  Three Months Ended June 30, Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Total revenues $1,953 $1,949 —% (2)% 2% —% 2%Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue — 26          Adjusted revenues $1,953 $1,975 (1)% (2)% 1% —% 1%      Components of Revenue Change  Six Months Ended June 30, Reported Change Currency Impact Constant Currency Change Acquisitions/Divestitures Organic Change  2017 2016       ($ in millions)          Total revenues $4,272 $4,183 2% (2)% 4% —% 4%Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue — 58          Adjusted revenues $4,272 $4,241 1% (2)% 3% —% 3%Adjusted Operating IncomeWe consider adjusted operating income to be an important financial measure, which is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. Adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.75Reconciliations of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in millions)Income from operations$124 $136 $587 $462Adjusted for certain items:      Amortization149 125 300 286Restructuring costs27 41 54 66Integration expenses63 29 103 81Provision for the Stanford litigation— — — 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 26 — 58Adjusted operating income$363 $357 $1,044 $1,003Adjusted operating income remained stable for the three months ended June 30, 2017 at $363 million, compared to $357 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016.Adjusted operating income for the first half of 2017 and 2016 was $1.0 billion. Income from operations increased by $125 million, largely due to additional client demand partially offset by increases in normal litigation reserves. Adjusted EBITDAWe consider adjusted EBITDA to be an important financial measure, which is used internally to evaluate and assess our core operations, to benchmark our operating results against our competitors, and to evaluate and measure our performance-based compensation plans.Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results.Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are as follows:  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 20172016 2017 2016 (in millions)NET INCOME$41 $76 $393 $321Provision for income taxes8 19 54 37Interest expense46 47 92 93Depreciation51 44 97 87Amortization149 125 300 286Restructuring costs27 41 54 66Integration expenses63 29 103 81Provision for the Stanford litigation— — — 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 26 — 58Gain on disposal of operations— (1) — (2)Venezuela currency devaluation 2 — 2 —Adjusted EBITDA$387 $406 $1,095 $1,077Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $387 million, compared to $406 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The second quarter of 2016 included settlement income of £28 million ($41 million) related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team.76Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2017 and 2016 was stable at $1.1 billion. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per ShareAdjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, diluted. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. Reconciliations of net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 ($ in millions)NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO WILLIS TOWERS WATSON$33 $72Adjusted for certain items: Amortization149 125Restructuring costs27 41Integration expenses63 29Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 26Gain on disposal of operations— (1)Venezuela currency devaluation 2 —Tax effect on certain items listed above (i)(76) (59)Adjusted net income$198 $233    Weighted average shares of common stock — diluted 137 140    Diluted earnings per share $0.24 $0.51Adjusted for certain items:   Amortization1.09 0.89Restructuring costs0.20 0.29Integration expenses0.46 0.21Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 0.19Gain on disposal of operations— (0.01)Venezuela currency devaluation 0.02 —Tax effect on certain items listed above (i)(0.56) (0.42)Adjusted diluted earnings per share $1.45 $1.66 __________________________i.The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.Our adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the prior year due primarily to the $41 million received in 2016 related to the Fine Arts, Jewellery and Specie team settlement.Reconciliations of net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are as follows:77 Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 ($ in millions)NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO WILLIS TOWERS WATSON$377 $310Adjusted for certain items: Amortization300 286Restructuring costs54 66Integration expenses103 81Provision for the Stanford litigation— 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 58Gain on disposal of operations— (2)Venezuela currency devaluation 2 —Tax effect on certain items listed above (i)(145) (153)Tax effects of internal reorganization19 —Adjusted net income$710 $696    Weighted average shares of common stock — diluted 137 138    Diluted earnings per share $2.75 $2.25Adjusted for certain items:   Amortization2.19 2.07Restructuring costs0.39 0.48Integration expenses0.75 0.59Provision for the Stanford litigation— 0.36Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 0.42Gain on disposal of operations— (0.02)Venezuela currency devaluation 0.02 —Tax effect on certain items listed above (i)(1.06) (1.11)Tax effects of internal reorganization0.14 —Adjusted diluted earnings per share $5.18 $5.04__________________________i.The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.As noted above, in analyzing both our adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA, the Company experienced additional client demand, partially offset by increases in normal litigation reserves. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share benefited from this revenue growth. Adjusted Income Before Taxes and Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax RateAdjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain on disposal of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.Adjusted income taxes/tax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, integration expenses, the fair value adjustment for deferred revenue, gain on disposal of operations, tax effects of internal reorganization and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate.78Management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items and the tax effects of our internal reorganization, which are not core to our current and future operations.Reconciliations of income from operations before income taxes and interest in earnings of associates to adjusted income and provision for income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are as follows:  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 20172016 2017 2016 ($ in millions)INCOME FROM OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND INTEREST IN EARNINGS OF ASSOCIATES$48 $95 $445 $357Adjusted for certain items:       Amortization149 125 300 286Restructuring costs27 41 54 66Integration expenses63 29 103 81Provision for the Stanford litigation— — — 50Fair value adjustment for deferred revenue— 26 — 58Gain on disposal of operations— (1) — (2)Venezuela currency devaluation2 — 2 —Adjusted income before taxes$289 $315 $904 $896        Provision for income taxes$8 $19 $54 $37Tax effect on certain items listed above(i)76 59 145 153Tax effects of internal reorganization— — (19) —Adjusted income taxes$84 $78 $180 $190        U.S. GAAP tax rate16.8% 20.6% 12.1% 10.4%Adjusted income tax rate29.1% 25.1% 20.0% 21.2%__________________________i.The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item.Our U.S. GAAP tax rate is generally lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35%. This is primarily due to our global mix of income, which creates deductions in jurisdictions with high statutory income tax rates. Our U.S. GAAP tax rate was 16.8% and 20.6%  for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 12.1% and 10.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Our adjusted income tax rates were 29.1% and 25.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 20.0% and 21.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The adjusted tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is higher than that for the three months ended June 30, 2016 due to a shift in our global mix of income. The adjusted tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 is lower than that for the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to the additional realization of deferred tax benefits.Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use and is used to evaluate our liquidity.79Reconciliations of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016(i) (in millions)Cash flows from operating activities$319 $436Less: Additions to fixed assets and software for internal use(119) (92)Free cash flow$200 $344__________________________i.As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, cash flows from operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased by $9 million, increasing free cash flow by the same amount. See Part I, Item 1. Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements of this Form 10-Q report for a further discussion of this change.The decrease in both cash flows from operations and free cash flows in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily resulted from higher capital expenditures, changes in working capital and higher discretionary compensation payments made in 2017 for the 2016 compensation cycle. This discretionary compensation payment was lower in 2016 because it included only a partial payment to Legacy Towers Watson colleagues due to the timing of the Merger. Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThere were no material changes from the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017.ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe have considered changes in our exposure to market risks during the six months ended June 30, 2017, including additional exposures to market risks as a consequence of the Merger, and have determined that there have been no material changes to our exposure to market risks from those described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2017.ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs of June 30, 2017, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) and the Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that the information required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingDuring the six months ended June 30, 2017, we began to consolidate our legacy enterprise resource planning accounting systems in certain geographies. During this time, the Legacy Willis operations of our North American, Australian and New Zealand businesses were migrated to the Legacy Towers Watson global system. The consolidation of additional geographies, including the U.K., is expected to be completed in multiple phases by early 2019. Transition to the global information system includes a significant effort in testing prior to system launch, training of colleagues who will be using the system, updating of our internal control process and procedures that will be impacted by the implementation and monitoring of the system's results. As a result of this implementation, our management has updated, and continues to update, the system of internal controls over the impacted areas for adequacy of design and operating effectiveness. Such changes became material during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.Aside from the implementation noted above, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.80Limitations on the Effectiveness of ControlsManagement, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud. However, management does expect that the control system provides reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. In addition, the design of such internal controls must take into account the costs of designing and maintaining such a control system. Certain inherent limitations exist in control systems to make absolute assurances difficult, including the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake, and that individuals can circumvent controls. The design of any control system is based in part upon existing business conditions and risk assessments. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. As a result, they may require change or revision. Because of the inherent limitations in a control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. Nevertheless, the disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their stated objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level. 81PART II.
