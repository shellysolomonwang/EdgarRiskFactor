Item 1A.Risk FactorsThe following should be read in conjunction with and supplements and amends the risk factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A. of the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and Part II, Item 1A. of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.Operation of the former Japan branch as a legal subsidiary could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, or financial position.The conversion of the Japan branch to a legal subsidiary, which the Company executed in the second quarter of 2018, is a complex undertaking and involves a number of risks, including information technology-related delays and problems, personnel loss, regulatory law changes, legal and regulatory requirements, changes to the Company's operations, and management distraction. The conversion and continued operation as a legal subsidiary may entail modifications of certain aspects of the Company's operations, which could result in additional costs or reduce net earnings. Any of these risks, if realized, could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.The Japan branch conversion is conditioned on the continued validity of a private letter ruling that the Company received from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling, the IRS could determine that the Japan branch conversion should be treated as a taxable transaction. For example, the IRS could conclude that the representations, assumptions and covenants on which the private letter ruling is based are untrue or not accurate. If the IRS made such a conclusion, the Japan branch conversion could be treated as a taxable transaction, and the Company could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities or litigation costs to defend the tax treatment by the IRS.96Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
