ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.   The risk factors set forth in Part 1, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflect certain risks associated with existing and potential lines of business and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in Part I, Item 2 of this report. Readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks actually occur.    On April 2, 2012, we completed the Redomestication, and Aon plc became the publicly held parent company of the Aon group. These risk factors supersede the risk factors set forth under the heading “Risks Related to Our Proposed Reincorporation in the United Kingdom” and supplement to the other risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.   Risks Related to Our Reincorporation in the United Kingdom   The expected benefits of the Redomestication may not be realized.   There can be no assurance that all of the goals of the Redomestication will be achievable, particularly as the achievement of the benefits are in many important respects subject to factors that we do not control. These factors would include such things as the reactions of third parties with whom we enter into contracts and do business and the reactions of investors, analysts, and U.K. and U.S. taxing authorities.   While we expect that, as a result of the Redomestication, we will benefit from the U.K. dividend exemption system for certain non-U.K. source dividends repatriated to the U.K. thereby increasing our financial flexibility, we cannot be assured that the benefits we expect will be realized. In particular, U.K. or U.S. tax authorities may challenge our application and/or interpretation of relevant tax laws, regulations or treaties, valuations and methodologies or other supporting documentation, and, if they are successful in doing so, we may not experience the level of benefits we anticipate; or, we may be subject to adverse tax consequences. Even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in contesting positions asserted or claims made by tax authorities, which may reduce the anticipated level of benefits.   Our effective tax rates and the benefits described herein are also subject to a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in the U.K. and the U.S., the financial performance of our business in various jurisdictions, currency exchange rate fluctuations (especially as between the British pound and the U.S. dollar), and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies of the U.K. or the U.S., including changes in interest rates. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be (and, in fact, often seem to be) interrelated, and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset, or more than offset, by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors.   We may be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.   Generally for U.S. federal tax purposes, a corporation is considered a tax resident in the place of its incorporation. Because we are incorporated under U.K. law, we should be a U.K. corporation and a U.K. tax resident under these general rules. However, Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to as the “Code”) generally provides that a corporation organized outside the U.S. which acquires substantially all of the assets of a corporation organized in the U.S. will be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal tax purposes if former shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own at least 80 percent (of either the voting power or the value) of the stock of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition and the expanded affiliated group does not have “substantial business activities” in the country in which the acquiring foreign corporation is organized. Pursuant to the merger, we acquired directly or indirectly all of Aon Corporation’s assets, and after the merger former Aon Corporation stockholders hold 100 percent of the Company by reason of their stock ownership of Aon Corporation. As a result, our expanded affiliated group must have substantial business activities in the U.K. after the merger in order for the Company not to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under Section 7874. There is no “safe harbor” or other guidance that confirms whether an expanded affiliated group’s business activities in a country of incorporation are deemed to be substantial. Therefore, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could interpret the Section 7874 “anti-inversion” rules so as to treat the Company as a U.S. corporation after the consummation of the merger and that such an IRS position would be sustained in litigation. Moreover, the United States Congress, the IRS, the United Kingdom Parliament or U.K. tax authorities may enact new statutory or regulatory provisions that could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation or otherwise adversely affect our anticipated global tax position following the merger and any subsequent actions. Retroactive statutory or regulatory   42        actions have occurred in the past, and there can be no assurance that any such provisions, if enacted or promulgated, would not have retroactive application to us, the merger or any subsequent actions.   Although we believe we should not be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under Section 7874, there is no certainty that the IRS will not assert a contrary position, in which case, we could become involved in a tax controversy with the IRS regarding possible additional U.S. tax liability. If we are unsuccessful in resolving any such tax controversy in our favor, we would likely not realize the tax savings we expect to achieve through reorganization.   HM. Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) may disagree with our conclusions on the U.K. tax treatment of the merger, or relevant U.K. legislation may be subject to change.   We have obtained a ruling from HMRC in respect of the stamp duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (“SDRT”) consequences of the merger and as a result believe that we have satisfied all stamp duty and SDRT payment and filing obligations in connection with the issuance of Class A Ordinary Shares issued in connection with the merger.   We have also obtained a ruling from HMRC that, following the merger, the “temporary period exemption” from the U.K.’s controlled foreign company rules will apply such that, subject to certain conditions and limitations based on our facts and circumstances, we will not be subject to tax on the profits of any controlled company that is resident in a foreign jurisdiction under the controlled foreign company (“CFC”) rules until 24 months after the end of the accounting period in which the merger occurs, subject to any changes of legislation. On March 29, 2012, the U.K. Government published the Finance (No 4) Bill, which proposed major reforms to the CFC rules for accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The proposed transitional rules would preserve the temporary period exemption for exempt periods beginning before the new rules come into force. While HMRC cannot provide any assurance in respect of the application of legislation that has not been enacted, we are of the view based on the Government’s proposals and published draft legislation that the new CFC rules should not have a material adverse effect on our tax treatment in the U.K. if enacted in their current form. However, to the extent that the Finance (No 4) Bill is enacted in a form different to that currently proposed, this may result in additional corporation tax liabilities becoming payable following implementation of the revised legislation.   Further, if HMRC disagrees with our view of any issues in respect of which no ruling has been obtained, it may take the position that material U.K. corporation tax or SDRT liabilities or amounts on account thereof are payable by any one or more of these companies as a result of the reorganization, in which case we expect that we would contest such assessment. To contest such assessment, we may be required to remit cash or provide security of the amount in dispute, or such lesser amount as permitted under U.K. law and acceptable to HMRC, to prevent HMRC from seeking enforcement actions pending the dispute of such assessment. If we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could be materially adverse to us. To the extent that HMRC has not provided (and we have not requested) a ruling on the U.K. tax aspects of the merger, there can be no assurance that HMRC will agree with our interpretation of the U.K. tax aspects of the merger or any related matters associated therewith.   Our net income and cash flow would be reduced if we become subject to U.S. corporate income tax.   We and our other non-U.S. affiliates will conduct our operations in a manner intended to ensure that we and our non-U.S. affiliates do not engage in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business. However, and on the assumption that we are not treated as a U.S. corporation by virtue of Code Section 7874 described above if we or any of our non-U.S. affiliates is or are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., we or our non-U.S. affiliates would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S. If this occurs, our results of operations may be adversely affected. In any event, Aon Corporation and any U.S. subsidiaries will be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on any worldwide income of any such U.S. company, and Aon Corporation’s foreign subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.   43        The Redomestication may not allow us to maintain a competitive global tax rate.   We believe that the Redomestication should significantly improve our ability to maintain a competitive global tax rate because the U.K. has implemented a dividend exemption system that generally does not subject non-U.K. earnings to U.K. tax when such earnings are repatriated to the U.K. in the form of dividends from non-U.K. subsidiaries. This should allow us to optimize our capital allocation and deploy efficient fiscal structures. However, we cannot provide any assurances as to what our global tax rate will be after the Redomestication because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as changes in U.S. and other tax laws, treaties and regulations. Our actual global tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. Additionally, the tax laws of the U.K. and other jurisdictions could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our global tax rate.   We also could be subject to future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities, and the resolution of such audits could impact our tax rate in future periods, as would any reclassification or other matter (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in attempting to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from any changes in law, audits and other matters. Our inability to mitigate the negative consequences of any changes in the law, audits and other matters could cause our global tax rate to increase and our results of operations to suffer.   The IRS may disagree with our conclusions on tax treatment of the merger.   We expect that the merger will not result in any material U.S. federal income tax liability to Aon Corporation or Aon plc. However, the IRS may disagree with our assessments of the effects or interpretation of the tax laws, treaties or regulations or their enforcement with respect to the merger. Nevertheless, even if our conclusions on the U.S. tax treatment of the merger to Aon Corporation and Aon plc do not ultimately prevail, we do not believe that a contrary treatment of the merger by the IRS would result in a material increase in U.S. taxes compared to our pre-merger U.S. tax position. In this event, however, we may not realize the expected tax benefits of the merger and our results of operations may be adversely affected in comparison to what they would have been if our conclusions had ultimately prevailed.   Negative publicity resulting from the merger could adversely affect our business and our share price.   Foreign reincorporations that have been undertaken by other companies have generated significant press coverage, much of which has been negative. In such situations, press coverage has been particularly negative where a company undertaking a proposed reincorporation has a historical connection to a particular U.S. locality or geographic region. Although Aon Corporation grew around the world to be a global leader in many of its businesses and has significant history in the U.K., Aon Corporation was founded in, and has historically been connected to, the Chicago, Illinois area.   Negative publicity generated by the Redomestication could cause our colleagues, particularly those in the United States, generally, and the Chicago area, in particular, to perceive uncertainty regarding future opportunities available to them. In addition, negative publicity could cause some of our clients to be reluctant to do business with us. Either of these events could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Negative publicity could also cause some of our shareholders to sell our shares or decrease the demand for new investors to purchase our shares, which could have an adverse impact on our shares price.   As a result of increased shareholder approval requirements, we have less flexibility as an English public limited company than as a Delaware corporation with respect to certain aspects of capital management.   Under Delaware law, directors may generally issue, without further shareholder approval, any shares authorized in a company’s certificate of incorporation that are not already issued or reserved. Delaware law also provides substantial flexibility in establishing the terms of preferred shares. However, English law provides that a board of directors may only allot shares with the prior authorization of shareholders, such authorization being up to the aggregate nominal amount of shares and for a maximum period of five years, each as specified in the articles of   44        association or relevant shareholder resolution. This authorization would need to be renewed by our shareholders upon its expiration (i.e., at least every five years). Our articles of association authorize the allotment of additional shares, and renewal of such authorization for additional five year terms may be sought more frequently.   English law also generally provides shareholders with preemptive rights when new shares are issued for cash; however, it is possible for the articles of association, or shareholders in general meeting, to exclude preemptive rights. Such an exclusion of preemptive rights may be for a maximum period of up to five years from the date of adoption of the articles of association, if the exclusion is contained in the articles of association, or from the date of the shareholder resolution, if the exclusion is by shareholder resolution; in either case, this exclusion would need to be renewed upon its expiration (i.e., at least every five years). Our articles of association exclude preemptive rights, and renewal of such exclusion for additional five year terms may be sought more frequently.   English law also generally prohibits a company from repurchasing its own shares by way of “off market purchases” without the prior approval of 75 percent of shareholders by special resolution. Such approval lasts for a maximum period of up to five years. English law prohibits us from conducting “on market purchases” as our shares are not traded on a recognized investment exchange in the U.K. Special resolutions were adopted to permit “off market purchases” prior to the effective time of the merger. These special resolutions will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years) but may be sought more frequently for additional five year terms.   The enforcement of civil liabilities against us may be more difficult.   Because we are a public limited company incorporated under English law, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would have been the case for U.S. judgments obtained against Aon Corporation. In addition, it may be more difficult (or impossible) to bring some types of claims against us in courts in England than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.   We are a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Therefore, it may not be possible to effect service of process upon us within the United States in order to enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.   There is doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities solely based on the U.S. federal securities laws. The English courts will, however, treat any amount payable by us under the U.S. judgment as a debt and new proceedings can be commenced in the English courts to enforce this debt against us. The following criteria must be satisfied in order for the English court to enforce the debt created by the U.S. judgment:   · the U.S. judgment must be for a debt or definite sum of money;   · the U.S. judgment must be final and conclusive;   · the U.S. court must, in the circumstances of the case, have had jurisdiction according to the English rules of private international law;   · the U.S. judgment must not have been obtained by fraud;   · the enforcement of the U.S. judgment must not be contrary to U.K. public policy; and   · the proceedings in which the U.S. judgment was obtained must not have been conducted contrary to the rules of natural justice.   The market for Class A Ordinary Shares may differ from the market for Aon Corporation shares.   Although the Class A Ordinary Shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol “AON,” which is the same symbol under which shares of Aon Corporation were listed, the market prices, trading volume and volatility of the Class A Ordinary Shares could be different from those of the Aon Corporation shares.   Transfers of the Class A Ordinary Shares may be subject to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in the Class A Ordinary Shares as compared to the Aon Corporation shares.   Stamp duty and/or SDRT are imposed in the U.K. on certain transfers of chargeable securities (which include shares in companies incorporated in the U.K.) at a rate of 0.5 percent of the consideration paid for the transfer. Certain transfers of shares to depositaries or into clearance systems are charged at a higher rate of 1.5 percent.   You are strongly encouraged to hold your Class A Ordinary Shares in book entry form through the facilities of DTC. Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC will not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of title in the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5 percent of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document stamped by HMRC) before the transfer can be registered in the books of Aon UK. If those shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.   We have put in place arrangements to require that shares held in certificated form cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the shares has first delivered the shares to a depository specified by us   45        so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depository. Any such shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depository. Before the transfer can be registered in our books, the transferor will also be required to put in the depository funds to settle the resultant liability to SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5 percent of the value of the shares.   Following the decision of the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) in HSBC Holdings plc, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation v HMRC 2012 UKFTT 163 (TC) and the announcement by HMRC that it will not seek to appeal the decision, HMRC is no longer enforcing the charge to SDRT on the issue of shares into either EU or non-EU depository receipt or clearance systems. It is possible that the UK government may change the law in relation to stamp duty and SDRT in response to this decision, and that this would have a material effect on the cost of dealing in our shares.   If the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in our securities may be disrupted.   The facilities of DTC are a widely-used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. We believe that prior to the merger approximately 99% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Aon Corporation were held within the DTC system. The Class A Ordinary Shares of Aon plc are, at present, eligible for deposit and clearing within the DTC system. In connection with the closing of the merger, we entered into arrangements with DTC whereby we agreed to indemnify DTC for any stamp duty and/or SDRT that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our Class A Ordinary Shares. In addition, we have obtained a ruling from HMRC in respect of the stamp duty and SDRT consequences of the reorganization, and SDRT has been paid in accordance with the terms of this ruling in respect of the deposit of Class A Ordinary Shares with the initial depository. DTC will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the Class A Ordinary Shares. If DTC determines at any time that the Class A Ordinary Shares are not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities, then we believe the Class A Ordinary Shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a U.S. securities exchange or inclusion in the S&P 500 and trading in the Class A Ordinary Shares would be disrupted. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Class A Ordinary Shares.   We expect to incur transaction costs in connection with the completion of the Redomestication.   We plan to examine various potential transactions for the further repositioning of our organizational structure and certain of our subsidiaries. We refer to these activities and transactions as “subsequent actions.” Aon Corporation could recognize gain, and be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any such gain, as a result of one or more of these transactions. The amount of income taxes incurred in connection with any transactions will depend on a   46        number of factors. Based on information currently available, we do not expect any transactions to have a significant impact on our reported income tax expense.   We are also reevaluating the ability to realize our deferred tax assets related to U.S. operations under our new Aon plc corporate structure and we may recognize a non-cash, deferred tax expense upon the conclusion of this evaluation. Based on information currently available, we do not expect the additional deferred tax expense, if any, to be significant.   The Redomestication will result in additional ongoing costs to us.   The Redomestication will result in an increase in some of our ongoing expenses and require us to incur some new expenses. Some costs, including those related to employees in our U.K. offices and holding board meetings in the U.K., are expected to be higher than would be the case if our principal executive offices were not relocated to the U.K.. We also expect to incur new expenses, including professional fees and SDRT in connection with settlement of equity-based awards under our stock or share incentive plans, to comply with U.K. corporate and tax laws.
