ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   The risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors to the 2007 Form 10-K of Aon Corporation (“Aon,” “we,” “us” or “our”) have been updated as set forth below to reflect our divestiture earlier this year of our Combined Insurance Company of America and Sterling Life Insurance Company subsidiaries that reduced our risk from underwriting businesses and the new acquisition and integration risks arising from our intention to acquire Benfield Group Limited. These updated risk factors set forth below supersede those contained in our 2007 Form 10-K and readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks actually occur.   The following are certain risks related to our business specifically and the insurance industry generally that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risk factors are:   Our results may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance industries.   Our results historically have been subject to significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the insurance industry. Changes in premium rates generally affect the commissions and fees payable to our brokerage businesses.   Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.   Since the Attorney General of New York brought charges against one of our competitors in October 2004, there has been a great deal of uncertainty concerning then longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Soon after the Attorney General brought those charges, Aon and certain other large insurance brokers announced that they would terminate contingent commission arrangements with underwriters. Most insurance brokers, however, currently continue to enter into such arrangements, and regulators have not taken action to end such arrangements throughout the industry.   Our results may be adversely affected by the impact disruptions in the credit and financial markets have on our customers and the insurance industry.   The recent disruption in the global credit markets, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets have created increasing difficult conditions for financial institutions, including those in the insurance industry. Continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets may reduce our customers’ demand for our brokerage and reinsurance services and products and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry. This could then reduce placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability.   We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.   We believe that competition in our lines of business is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength and name recognition. In particular, we compete with a large number of national, regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers.   We encounter strong competition for both clients and professional talent in our insurance brokerage and risk management services operations from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms throughout the world, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants that provide risk related services and products. Our consulting operations compete with independent   49        consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world.   In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:   · the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds;   · changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory investigations;   · the establishment of programs in which state sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative types of coverage;   · additional regulations promulgated by the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) in the United Kingdom, or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.   New competition as a result of these developments could cause the supply of, and demand for, our products and services to change, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plans.   In third quarter 2007, we announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and to reduce future expense growth to better serve clients (the “2007 Plan”). As a result, we have adopted restructuring initiatives that are expected to result in the elimination of an estimated 2,700 employee positions, the closing or consolidation of several offices, asset impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We currently expect that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges of $450 million. We anticipate that our annualized savings from the 2007 Plan will be approximately $300 million by 2010. We cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings. In 2005, we began a restructuring initiative to reduce our fixed cost base and increase efficiency (the “2005 Plan”). The 2005 Plan is substantially complete, and resulted in cumulative pretax charges totalling $368 million. Restructuring costs included the elimination of approximately 3,600 employee positions, the closing of various offices, asset impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We anticipate that our annualized savings from the 2005 Plan will be approximately $270 million by 2008. Estimated savings from the 2007 and 2005 Plans do not include any benefits related to businesses placed in discontinued operations. We cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings.   Changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results.   We carry an investment portfolio of fixed-maturity and other long-term investments. As of September 30, 2008, our continuing operations had fixed-maturity investments (100 percent investment grade) that had a carrying value of $132 million and our other long term investments had a carrying value of $276 million. Funds held on behalf of clients, which were $3.1 billion at September 30, 2008, are held in short-term investments. Changes in interest rates and investment prices could reduce the value of our investment portfolio and adversely affect our financial condition or results.   For example, changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from, and the market value of, fixed maturity investments. Similarly, general economic conditions, stock market conditions and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our equity investments. We monitor our portfolio for other than temporary impairments in carrying value. For securities judged to have an other than temporary impairment, we recognize a realized loss through the statement of income to write down the value of those securities.   50        We are also subject to potential declines in credit quality, either related to issues specific to certain industries or to a weakening in the economy in general. The concentration of our investment portfolio in any particular industry, group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio and, consequently, on our results of operations and financial condition. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause realized losses on securities, including realized losses relating to derivative strategies. The financial and liquidity needs of our business could also cause us to sell assets from our investment portfolio at unfavorable prices.   Our net pension liabilities may grow, and the fair value of our pension plan assets may decrease, which could adversely affect our stockholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity and require us to make additional cash contributions to our pension plans.   To the extent that the present value of the benefits incurred to date for pension obligations in the major countries in which we operate continues to exceed the value of the assets supporting these obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In certain previous years, there have been declines in interest rates. As a result of lower interest rates, the present value of plan liabilities increased faster than the value of plan assets, resulting in significantly higher unfunded positions in several of our major pension plans.   We currently plan on contributing approximately $182 million to our major pension plans, although we may elect to contribute more. Total cash contributions to these pension plans in 2007 were $211 million, which was an increase of $7 million from 2006. In 2006, we also contributed $166 million of non cash financial instruments to certain of our United Kingdom plans. In total, our 2007 contributions to these pension plans were $159 million less than in 2006. Future estimates are based on certain assumptions, including discount rates, interest rates, mortality, fair value of assets and expected return on plan assets.   Periodic revision of pension assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and the resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders’ equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been estimated.   We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.   We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. We have purchased errors and omissions (“E&O”) insurance and other appropriate insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income.   At the time of the 2004-05 investigation of the insurance industry by the Attorney General of New York (“NYAG”) and other regulators, purported classes of clients filed civil litigation against us and other companies under a variety of legal theories, including state tort, contract, fiduciary duty, antitrust and statutory theories and federal antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”) theories. The federal actions were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and a state court collective action was filed in California.   51        In the New Jersey actions, the Court dismissed plaintiffs’ federal antitrust and RICO claims in separate orders in August and October 2007, respectively. Plaintiffs have appealed these dismissals. We believe we have meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.   Also at the time of the NYAG investigation, putative classes filed actions against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the federal securities laws and ERISA. Plaintiffs in the federal securities class action have recently submitted purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $353 million to $498 million, and plaintiffs in the ERISA class actions have recently submitted purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $59 million to $349 million. We will soon submit our own expert reports, which will vigorously challenge these damage estimates, as well as plaintiffs’ underlying theories of liability. We believe we have meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.   Following inquiries from regulators, we commenced an internal review of our compliance with certain U.S. and non-U.S. anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). An outside law firm with significant experience in the area is overseeing the review. Certain governmental agencies, including the U.K. Financial Services Authority, the City of London police, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Department of Justice, are also investigating these matters. We are fully cooperating with these investigations, and have agreed with the U.S. agencies to toll any applicable statute of limitations pending completion of the investigations. Based on current information, we are unable to predict at this time when these matters will be concluded, or what regulatory or other outcomes may result.   A financial institution in the U.K. called Standard Life Assurance Ltd. brought an action in London Commercial Court against us seeking more than £50 million ($92 million at September 30, 2008 exchange rates) for alleged errors or omissions in the placement of a professional indemnity policy with certain underwriters. In a preliminary decision issued on February 13, 2008, the court construed the relevant policy language to excuse underwriters from paying Standard Life and concluded that we were negligent in not seeking changes to the language. We filed an interlocutory appeal of this preliminary decision. In July 2008, we reached a settlement with underwriters under which underwriters agreed to pay a portion of the ultimate recovery by Standard Life in exchange for us dropping our appeal of the preliminary decision. In subsequent proceedings in the Commercial Court, we will vigorously contest Standard Life’s claims based on a variety of legal and factual arguments. We have a potential negligence claim against a different third party which provided advice with respect of the relevant policy language, and we further believe that, as a result of an indemnity given to us by a third party, we are entitled to indemnification in whole or part for our losses in this matter.   A putative class action, Buckner v. Resource Life, is pending in state court in Columbus, Georgia against a former subsidiary of Aon, Resource Life Insurance Company. The complaint alleges that Resource Life, which wrote policies insuring repayment of auto loans, was obligated to identify and return unearned premium to policyholders whose loans terminated before the end of their scheduled terms. In connection with the sale of Resource Life in 2006, we agreed to indemnify Resource Life’s buyer in certain respects relating to this action. We believe that Resource Life has meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending this action. The outcome of the action, and the amount of any losses or other payments that may result, cannot be predicted at this time.   Virginia Surety Company, Inc. (“VSC”), a former property and casualty underwriting subsidiary of Aon, is engaged in arbitration and litigation proceedings with Applied Underwriters, Inc. (“Applied”), a managing general agent (“MGA”). In these proceedings, Applied seeks approximately $190 million for, inter alia, an alleged diminution in Applied’s value following VSC’s termination of an MGA contract between the parties. In connection with the sale of Aon Warranty Group (“AWG”) (which includes VSC) in 2006, we agreed to retain certain obligations related to VSC’s property and casualty underwriting business, now in runoff, including this matter. We believe that VSC has meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending the arbitration and litigation.   52        The outcome of the action, and the amount of any losses or other payments that may result, cannot be predicted at this time.   Although the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us or our subsidiaries, on the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of our management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, it is possible that our future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.   We are subject to E&O claims against us.   In our insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, we often assist our clients with matters which include the placement of insurance coverage or employee benefit plans and the handling of related claims. E&O claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured. It is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, E&O claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.   Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.   Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including underwriters, brokers and other professional personnel. Competition for such experienced professional personnel is intense. If we cannot hire and retain talented personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.   Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.   Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. With respect to our insurance brokerage businesses, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and third party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of other insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations.   Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit plan regulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and federal taxation, do affect the insurance industry generally. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted by the federal government, including the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, have created additional administrative and compliance requirements for us.   With respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses, the financial impact of use of capital restrictions and increased training and employee expenses. Furthermore, the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction.   53        In all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our businesses can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as we it has been conducted in the past.   Our significant global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.   A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:   · the general economic and political conditions existing in those countries;   · devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;   · imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;   · imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;   · difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;   · hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;   · imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;   · longer payment cycles;   · greater difficulties in accounts receivables collection; and   · the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.   Some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. We must also translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse transaction and translation effects due to exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results.   Our financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing our underwriting reserves differ from actual experience.   We maintain claims reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by our insurance underwriting operations, which are in runoff. These reserves could cause variability in our financial results.   Claim reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees and general expenses for administering the claims adjustment process, and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accounting period. If the reserves, as currently estimated for future claims, prove inadequate, we would be required to increase our liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.   The obligation for future claims does not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent our management’s best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These estimates represent informed judgments based on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation,   54        judicial and legal developments and legislative changes, can cause our estimates to vary. The inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities, where the variables affecting these types of claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates are periodically refined as experience develops and further losses are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. Because setting the level of claims reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure investors that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.   Each of our business lines may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity.   The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses. In particular, a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Moreover, the results of our consulting business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. As our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to delay or forgo consulting engagements with Aon.   We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.   As of September 30, 2008, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.0 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility.   A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility.   A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility. In addition, certain downgrades may trigger our obligations to fund certain amounts with respect to our premium finance securitizations. Similarly, a downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether. We cannot assume that our financial position would not be adversely affected if we are unable to access the commercial paper market.   Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results.   We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to reserves to pay policy liabilities, deferred policy acquisition costs, the valuation of investments, income taxes, stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in accounting standards could increase costs to our organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.   We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.   Our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We have to rely on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses.   We cannot guarantee that our reinsurers of our property and casualty business will pay in a timely fashion, if at all.   To better manage our portfolio of underwriting risk, we purchased reinsurance by transferring part of the risk (known as ceding) to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium that we had received in connection with the risk.   55        Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred (or ceded) to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Recently, due to industry and general economic conditions, there is an increasing risk of insolvency among reinsurance companies, resulting in a greater incidence of litigation and affecting the recoverability of claims. We cannot assure that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis.   In connection with the sale of AWG on November 30, 2006, we sold the capital stock of VSC. Because VSC issued property and casualty policies, VSC continues to remain liable to property and casualty policyholders. However, pursuant to contractual arrangements entered into as part of the sale of AWG, Aon has agreed to indemnify the buyer of VSC for all obligations arising out of the property and casualty business, including any failure by reinsurers to meet their obligations with respect to the property and casualty business. We have also agreed to guarantee amounts owed by reinsurers in respect of the Construction Program Group (“CPG”) business issued prior to the closing of that transaction. If reinsurers fail to pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to VSC with respect to the property and casualty business (including with respect to CPG business) or do not pay on a timely basis, we will be responsible for these amounts.   The occurrence of natural or man made disasters could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.   We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods and tornadoes, and pandemic health events such as avian influenza, as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions. For example, a natural or man-made disaster could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and contract holders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations, such as payment of premiums on their insurance policies. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.   A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio if it affects companies’ ability to pay principal or interest on their securities. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.   In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategy, we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses.   In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire other businesses or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which may impact our results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.   Factors Relating to the Acquisition of Benfield   On August 22, 2008, we and Benfield Group Limited, a Bermuda company and an independent insurance intermediary (“Benfield”), issued an announcement (the “Announcement”) under Section 2.5 of the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the “Code”) disclosing that they have reached an agreement pursuant to which we will acquire all of the share capital of Benfield (the “Acquisition”). The Acquisition will be effected by a newly-formed, wholly-owned Bermuda subsidiary of ours through an amalgamation under the Bermuda Companies Act for an aggregate cash purchase price of £844 million or £3.50 per Benfield share ($1,557 million at September 30, 2008 exchange rates). Also on August 22, 2008, we and Benfield contemporaneously entered into an Implementation Agreement (the “Implementation Agreement”) which sets forth certain key terms relative to the Acquisition.   56        The closing of the Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions; if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, we will not be able to close the Acquisition.   The Acquisition contains a number of conditions which must be satisfied or waived prior to the closing of the Acquisition. These conditions include, among others, the parties obtaining certain antitrust and regulatory approvals including those required in the United States, United Kingdom and Bermuda, the accuracy of certain representations and warranties (subject to agreed-upon materiality standards) and the compliance by us and Benfield with covenants contained in the Implementation Agreement and the Announcement. We cannot assure you that the Acquisition will be closed on the terms described herein or at all.   If the Acquisition is not closed, there may be various adverse consequences including:   · certain of the transaction costs, including accounting, legal and other financial advisory fees, must still be paid, without any offsetting benefits from the Acquisition;   · Aon’s businesses may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Acquisition, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Acquisition; and   · the market price of Aon common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed.   The anticipated benefits from the Acquisition may not be realized.   The success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Aon and Benfield including, among other things, synergies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Although we expect to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, no assurance can be given that we will successfully combine the businesses of Aon and Benfield and that these anticipated Acquisition benefits will actually be achieved as achieving such benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties. Additionally, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, the benefits from the Acquisition may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating Benfield into Aon, and regulatory authorities may impose adverse conditions on our business in connection with granting approval of the Acquisition. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. If we fail to realize all or some of the benefits we anticipate from the Acquisition or if we fail to realize those benefits in the anticipated time period, our results of operations may be adversely affected.   The integration of Benfield may not be successful.   We may be unable to effectively integrate Benfield into our operations, which would result in fewer benefits from the Acquisition than are currently anticipated, as well as increased costs. The Acquisition involves numerous integration and other risks, including:   · potential difficulties in the assimilation of operations, services, products and personnel;   · potential loss of customers, vendors and other business partners;   · the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;   · the potential loss of key employees;   · the consolidation of functional areas, such as sales and marketing operations;   · possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between us and Benfield;   57        · the integration of information, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems;   · the coordination of organizations headquartered in different geographic regions; and   · potentially significant transaction, integration and restructuring costs.   If the integration is not successful, we may not be able to achieve expected results and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. We cannot give any assurance that Benfield will be successfully or cost-effectively integrated into us.      ITEM 2.       UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
