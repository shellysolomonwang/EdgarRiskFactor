ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.   The risk factors set forth in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, Part II, “Item 1A, Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and “Item 1A, Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2012 reflect certain risks associated with existing and potential lines of business and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in Part I, Item 2 of this report. Readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks actually occur.   The following risk factor supplements the risk factors set forth in the 10-K and 10-Qs.   We may in the future be subject to the UK Takeover Code, which may deter potential acquirers from proceeding with a takeover offer that could be beneficial to shareholders.   In the United Kingdom, takeover offers for certain public companies are regulated by the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, or the Takeover Code, which is administered by the Takeover Panel. Currently, the Takeover Code applies to public companies that have their registered offices in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man if their securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market in the United Kingdom or on a stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. The Takeover Code also applies to public companies that have their registered office in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man but whose securities are not admitted to trading on one of the markets mentioned above if the Takeover Panel determines, generally based on the residency of the company’s directors — the so-called residency test — that the company has its place of central management and control in the UK, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. In connection with our redomestication, the Takeover Panel confirmed that based on the residency test and on the expected residence of our directors and management, the Takeover Code would not apply to us.   In July 2012, the Takeover Panel published a consultation paper setting out proposed amendments to the Takeover Code, including a proposal to eliminate the residency test. If this proposal is adopted, we would likely become subject to the Takeover Code.   In summary, the Takeover Code sets out binding rules that provide a framework within which takeovers are required to be conducted and its approach differs from, and in some cases conflicts with, the approach set forth under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission to which we will remain subject in any event. If we become subject to the Takeover Code, we will be required to comply with these additional controls with respect to the conduct of any takeover offer for our ordinary shares, and these additional controls may create uncertainty in the process by which a takeover offer must be executed. These additional controls and attendant uncertainty may affect the willingness of potential acquirers to proceed with a takeover offer that may otherwise be beneficial to shareholders.   The following risk factor supersedes the similarly captioned risk factor set forth in the 10-K and supplements the other risk factors in the 10-K and the 10-Qs. It reflects modifications to the nature of the risk that have developed since the date on which the 10-K was filed.   Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or increase competition.   Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services, or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings.   With respect to our Risk Solutions segment, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and third party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations.   57        Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit plan regulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and federal taxation, trade sanctions regulation and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), do affect the insurance industry generally. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted, or proposed to be adopted, by the federal government, including the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act have created additional administrative and compliance requirements for us.   The areas in which we provide outsourcing and consulting services are also the subject of government regulation, which is constantly evolving. Changes in government regulations in the United States affecting the value, use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare (such as medical) plans, defined contribution (such as 401(k)) plans, defined benefit (such as pension) plans or payroll delivery, may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services. Recently, we have seen regulatory initiatives result in companies either discontinuing their defined benefit programs or de-emphasizing the importance such programs play in the overall mix of their benefit programs with a trend toward increased use of defined contribution plans. If organizations discontinue or de-emphasize defined benefit plans more rapidly than we anticipate, the results of our business could be adversely affected.   In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of portions of the U.S. government enacted health care reform legislation, including portions that will impact how our clients offer health care to their employees. We have made significant investments in product development to assist clients in de-risking their health benefits and migrate then towards a defined contribution versus a defined benefit. Depending on future changes to health legislation, these investments may not yield returns. In addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from these laws and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in the HR Solutions segment, could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer-sponsored health care in response to the newly enacted legislation, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.   With respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses and increased training and employee expenses. In connection with our proposed reorganization under a newly formed holding company incorporated in the U.K. for example, we may incur increased costs from complying with additional local regulations and requirements such as those arising under the U.K. Companies Act. Furthermore, the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction.   In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.   In addition, new regulatory or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us. These developments include:   · the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds; · changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory actions or changes; · the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative types of coverage; · changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans; or · additional regulations promulgated by the FSA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.   Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. Likewise, increased government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.   58        ITEM 2.
