ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.   The risk factors set forth in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the “10-K”) and in Part II, “Item 1A, Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2012 (the “10-Q”), reflect certain risks associated with existing and potential lines of business and contain “forward-looking statements” as discussed in Part I, Item 2 of this report. Readers should consider them in addition to the other information contained in this report as our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these risks actually occur.   The following risk factor supplements the risk factors set forth in the 10-K and 10-Q.   Uncertainty surrounding the ability of various European countries to satisfy their debt obligations, questions surrounding the future of the Euro, and instability surrounding economic conditions in Europe generally could each have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects for growth.   Continued concerns regarding the ability of certain European countries to service their outstanding debt have given rise to instability in the global credit and financial markets. This instability has in turn led to questions regarding the future viability of the Euro as a single currency for the region as some countries may consider returning to their former local currencies in an effort to regain control over their domestic economies. This uncertainty has had a dampening effect on growth potential in Europe, and if it continues to deteriorate, may have a material negative impact on our European business as well as that of our clients. Further, any development that has the effect of devaluing or replacing the Euro could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets denominated in that currency, potentially result in charges to our statement of operations and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency such as our Euro Credit Facility.   We also deposit some of our cash, including cash held in a fiduciary capacity, with certain European financial institutions. While we are constantly monitoring and managing exposures associated with those deposits, to the extent the uncertainty surrounding economic stability in Europe and the future viability of the Euro currency suddenly and adversely impacts those financial institutions, some or all of those cash deposits could be at risk.   The risk factors below supersede the similarly captioned risk factors set forth in the 10-K and supplement the other risk factors in the 10-K and 10-Q. They reflect modifications to the nature of the risks that have developed since the date on which the 10-K was filed.   Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.   Operating funds available for corporate use and funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $802 million and $12.7 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2012. These funds are reported in Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, and Fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of other long-term investments. As of June 30, 2012, these long-term investments had a carrying value of $200 million. Changes in interest rates and counterparty credit quality, including default, could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. For example, changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from cash balances and short-term investments. Similarly, general economic conditions, stock market conditions, financial stability of the investees and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our long-term investments. And, our cash holdings, including cash held in our fiduciary capacity, are subject to the credit, liquidity and other risks faced by our financial institution counterparties.   While we regularly measure, monitor and mitigate our exposure to these risks, a deterioration in the credit or liquidity of any of these counterparties, particularly if sudden or severe, could in turn adversely affect us. We also assess our portfolio for other-than-temporary impairments. For investments in which the fair value is less than the carrying value and the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we recognize a loss in the Consolidated Statement of Income.   61        Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could reduce our profitability, limit our growth, or increase competition.   Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign governmental regulation and supervision, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services, or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings.   With respect to our Risk Solutions segment, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and third party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing or managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations.   Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit plan regulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and federal taxation, trade sanctions regulation and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (‘‘FCPA’’), do affect the insurance industry generally. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted by the federal government, including the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, have created additional administrative and compliance requirements for us.   The areas in which we provide outsourcing and consulting services are also the subject of government regulation, which is constantly evolving. Changes in government regulations in the United States affecting the value, use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs, including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare (such as medical) plans, defined contribution (such as 401(k)) plans, defined benefit (such as pension) plans or payroll delivery, may adversely affect the demand for, or profitability of, our services. Recently, we have seen regulatory initiatives result in companies either discontinuing their defined benefit programs or de-emphasizing the importance such programs play in the overall mix of their benefit programs with a trend toward increased use of defined contribution plans. If organizations discontinue or de-emphasize defined benefit plans more rapidly than we anticipate, the results of our business could be adversely affected.   In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of portions of the U.S. government enacted health care reform legislation, including portions that will impact how our clients offer health care to their employees. We have made significant investments in product development to assist clients in de-risking their health benefits and migrate then towards a defined contribution versus a defined benefit. Depending on future changes to health legislation, these investments may not yield returns. In addition, if we are unable to adapt our services to changes resulting from these laws and any subsequent regulations, our ability to grow our business or to provide effective services, particularly in the HR Solutions segment, could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if our clients reduce the role or extent of employer-sponsored health care in response to the newly enacted legislation, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.   With respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses and increased training and employee expenses. In connection with our proposed reorganization under a newly formed holding company incorporated in the U.K. for example, we may incur increased costs from complying with additional local regulations and requirements such as those arising under the U.K. Companies Act. Furthermore, the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction.   In all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.   62        In addition, new regulatory or industry developments could create an increase in competition that could adversely affect us. These developments include: · the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds; · changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory actions or changes; · the establishment of programs in which state-sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative types of coverage; · changes in regulations relating to health and welfare plans, defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans; or · additional regulations promulgated by the FSA in the U.K., or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.   Changes in the regulatory scheme, or even changes in how existing regulations are interpreted, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by limiting revenue streams or increasing costs of compliance. Likewise, increased government involvement in the insurance or reinsurance markets could curtail or replace our opportunities and negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.   We rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our operations, sales and operating results.   We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within the Company and some are outsourced. All information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to computer viruses, security breach, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. There also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not installed properly. Although we have not been the victim of cyber attacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition, we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity breaches such as computer viruses and similar information technology violations in the ordinary course of business. We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network disruptions, but a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our operations and financial results. In addition, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.   63        ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
