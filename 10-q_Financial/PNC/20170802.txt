(b) The effective income tax rates are generally lower than the statutory rate due to the relationship of pretax income to tax credits and earnings that are not subject to tax.    (c) Calculated as annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the Consolidated Income Statement. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were $54 million and $48 million, respectively. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were $106 million and $96 million, respectively.

Capital Highlights  We maintained a strong capital position and continued to return capital to shareholders.      •    The Transitional Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.3% at June 30, 2017 compared to 10.6% at December 31, 2016.      •    Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was an estimated 9.8% at June 30, 2017 compared to 10.0% at December 31, 2016 based on the standardized approach rules.      •    In the second quarter of 2017, we returned $1.0 billion of capital to shareholders through repurchases of 5.7 million common shares for $.7 billion and dividends on common shares of $.3 billion, completing our common stock repurchase program for the four quarter period ending in the second quarter of 2017.      •    In June 2017, we announced share repurchase programs of up to $2.7 billion for the four-quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2017, including repurchases of up to $.3 billion related to employee benefit plans.      •    In July 2017, our board of directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 75 cents per share, an increase of 20 cents per share, or 36%, effective with the August 2017 dividend.  See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our 2017 capital and liquidity actions as well as our capital ratios.  Our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends or to repurchase shares under current or future programs, is subject to the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR   process. For additional information, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2016 Form 10-K.  Business Outlook  Statements regarding our business outlook are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our forward-looking statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our current view that the U.S. economy and the labor market will grow moderately in 2017, boosted by stable oil/energy prices, improving consumer spending and housing activity, and some federal fiscal policy stimulus as a result of the 2016 elections. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected to continue rising in 2017; inflation has slowed in the first half of 2017, but should gradually accelerate into 2018. Specifically, our business outlook reflects our expectation of continued steady growth in GDP, one 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December of 2017, and an announcement from the Federal Reserve that it will begin to reduce the size of its balance sheet in the fall of 2017. We are also assuming that long-term rates rise at a slower pace than short-term rates. See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2016 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  For the full year 2017 compared to full year 2016, we continue to expect:      •    Loans to increase by mid-single digits, on a percentage basis;      •    Revenue growth in the upper end of the mid-single digit range, on a percentage basis;      •    Noninterest expense to increase by low single digits, on a percentage basis; and      •    The effective tax rate to be between 25% and 26% absent the impact of any tax reform.  For each remaining quarter of 2017, we expect other noninterest income to be between $250 million and $300 million.  For the third quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2017, we expect:      •    Modest loan growth;      •    Net interest income to increase by low single digits, on a percentage basis;      •    Fee income to be stable. Fee income consists of asset management, consumer services, corporate services, residential mortgage and service charges on deposits;      •    Provision for credit losses to be between $75 million and $125 million; and      •    Noninterest expense to be stable.     4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW  Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Net income for the second quarter of 2017 was $1.1 billion, or $2.10 per diluted common share, an increase of 11% compared to $1.0 billion, or $1.82 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2016. For the first six months of 2017, net income was $2.2 billion, or $4.05 per diluted common share, an increase of 12% compared to $1.9 billion, or $3.49 per diluted common share, for the first six months of 2016.  Net income increased in both comparisons driven by a 7% increase in revenue from higher net interest income and noninterest income and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 5% increase in noninterest expense.

To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 5     Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional information.  Net interest income increased by $190 million, or 9%, and $252 million, or 6%, for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016. The increase in both comparisons was attributable to higher loan yields and loan growth, as well as increased securities balances, partially offset by an increase in borrowing and deposit costs. Net interest margin increased in both comparisons largely reflecting the benefit from higher interest rates in the 2017 periods.  Average investment securities increased $5.2 billion, or 7%, and $5.6 billion, or 8%, in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively. The increase in both comparisons reflected net purchases of agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S Treasury securities, partially offset by declines in average commercial mortgage-backed securities and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Total investment securities increased to 23% of average interest-earning assets compared to 22% in the quarterly comparison and was 23% in both of the year-to-date periods.  Average loans grew $8.0 billion, or 4%, and $6.6 billion, or 3%, in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively. The increase in average loans in both comparisons was driven by broad growth across our businesses within our Corporate & Institutional Banking segment, as well as higher residential mortgage loans within our Retail Banking segment. Both comparisons also reflected the impact of our acquisition of a commercial and vendor finance business with $1.0 billion of loans and leases. These increases were partially offset by decreases in consumer loans driven by runoff in the non-strategic consumer loan portfolios of brokered home equity and government guaranteed education loans. Loans remained stable at 67% of average interest-earning assets in the quarterly comparison and 66% for the first six months of 2017 compared to 67% for the same period in 2016.  Average total deposits of $256.4 billion for the second quarter of 2017 grew $8.8 billion, or 4%, over the second quarter of 2016, and average year-to-date deposits grew $8.8 billion, or 4%, over the same period of 2016, largely due to growth in average interest-bearing deposits, which increased $7.2 billion and $7.6 billion in both comparisons. This growth was driven by higher average savings deposits, which reflected a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products, as well as higher average interest-bearing demand deposits. Average interest-bearing deposits represented 76% of average interest-bearing liabilities in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparison.

The comparable amounts for the year-to-date periods were both 44%.  Asset management revenue increased in both comparisons driven by higher earnings from BlackRock and the impact of higher average equity markets in our asset management business. Discretionary client assets under management increased to $141 billion at June 30, 2017 compared with $135 billion at June 30, 2016.  Corporate services revenue increased in both comparisons largely reflecting higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and other capital markets-related revenue, including both higher loan syndication fees and treasury management fees.  Residential mortgage revenue decreased in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons as a result of lower loan sales revenue and a lower benefit from residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge.     6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Other noninterest income increased in both comparisons largely driven by higher revenue from private equity investments reflecting positive impacts from valuation adjustments on equity investments subject to the Volcker Rule provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and higher revenue from credit valuations on customer-related derivative activities. These increases were partially offset by the impact of 2016 net gains on the sale of Visa Class B common shares. The quarterly comparison also reflected higher revenue from commercial mortgage loans held for sale activities and higher operating lease income.  Provision For Credit Losses  The provision for credit losses decreased $29 million to $98 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016 and decreased $93 million to $186 million for the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in both periods was due to lower provisions for certain energy related loans in the oil, gas and coal sectors partially offset by an initial provision for a loan and lease portfolio obtained through the acquisition of a commercial and vendor finance business in the second quarter of 2017.  The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.

As of June 30, 2017, we were on track to achieve our full-year 2017 goal of $350 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, which we expect will fund a significant portion of our 2017 business and technology investments, including our Retail branch strategy, enhanced digital capabilities and our home lending transformation.  Effective Income Tax Rate  The effective income tax rate was 26.0% in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 24.3% in the second quarter of 2016 and 24.5% in the first six months of 2017 compared to 23.9% in the same period of 2016. The increases in both comparisons were primarily related to higher pretax earnings, and in the year-to-date comparison, partially offset by the impact of higher tax deductions related to stock-based compensation in the first quarter of 2017.

Our balance sheet was strong and well positioned at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.      •    Total assets increased as loan growth was partially offset by lower deposits held with the Federal Reserve Bank;      •    Total liabilities increased due to higher borrowed funds and deposit growth;      •    Total equity decreased due to a decline in noncontrolling interests related to the redemption of Perpetual Trust Securities in the first quarter of 2017.  The following discussion provides additional information about the major components of our balance sheet.

The decreases in home equity and education reflected runoff in the non-strategic brokered home equity and government guaranteed education loan portfolios.

(e) Includes available for sale and held to maturity securities.   Investment securities increased $.5 billion at June 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Growth in investment securities was driven by net purchases of agency residential mortgage-backed securities, largely offset by declines in commercial mortgage-backed securities.  Table 7 presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio by credit rating. We have included credit ratings information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio.  At least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on all securities. If economic conditions, including home prices, were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and liquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio would likely be adversely affected and we could incur additional OTTI credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement.    The duration of investment securities was 3.3 years at June 30, 2017. We estimate that at June 30, 2017 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.5 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 3.1 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates.  Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding corporate stock and other) was 5.0 years at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

The overall increase in savings deposits reflected in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products.  The increase in total borrowed funds reflected net increases in bank notes and senior debt and FHLB borrowings, as new issuances outpaced maturities and calls. These increases were partially offset by subordinated debt maturities.  See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our 2017 capital and liquidity activities.  Shareholders’ Equity  Total shareholders’ equity as of June 30, 2017 increased $.4 billion compared to December 31, 2016. Increased retained earnings, driven by net income of $2.2 billion partially offset by $.7 billion of common and preferred dividends, was largely offset by common share repurchases of $1.3 billion.  Common shares outstanding were 480 million at June 30, 2017 and 485 million at December 31, 2016, as repurchases of 10.7 million shares during the period were partially offset by share issuances from treasury stock related to warrants exercised and stock-based compensation activity.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 11     BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW  Effective for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of changes to how we manage our businesses, we realigned our segments and, accordingly, have changed the basis of presentation of our segments, resulting in four reportable business segments:      •    Retail Banking      •    Corporate & Institutional Banking      •    Asset Management Group      •    BlackRock  Our changes in business segment presentation resulting from the realignment included the following:      •    The Residential Mortgage Banking segment was combined into Retail Banking as a result of our strategic initiative to transform the home lending process by integrating mortgage and home equity lending to enhance product capability and speed of delivery for a better customer experience and to improve efficiency. In conjunction with this shift, residential mortgages previously reported within the “Other” category were also moved to Retail Banking.      •    The Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio segment was eliminated. The segment’s remaining consumer assets were moved to the “Other” category as they are unrelated to the ongoing strategy of any segment, while its commercial assets were transferred to Corporate & Institutional Banking in order to continue the relationships we have with those customers.      •    A portion of business banking clients was moved from Retail Banking to Corporate & Institutional Banking to facilitate enhanced product offerings to meet the financial needs of our business banking clients.  Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors. Effective for the first quarter of 2017, we made certain adjustments to our internal funds transfer pricing methodology primarily relating to weighted average lives of certain non-maturity deposits based on our recent historical experience. These changes in methodology affected business segment results, primarily adversely impacting net interest income for Corporate & Institutional Banking and Retail Banking, offset by increased net interest income in the “Other” category.  The prior period presented was revised to conform to the new segment alignment and to our change in internal funds transfer pricing methodology.  Business segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 14 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial Review of business net interest revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis.  Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category in the business segment tables. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities and certain trading activities, exited businesses, certain non-strategic runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments’ results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.     12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Retail Banking  (Unaudited)  Table 10: Retail Banking Table                             Six months ended June 30 Dollars in

The decrease in earnings was driven by lower noninterest income and increased noninterest expense.  Noninterest income declined in the comparison due to the impact of 2016 net gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares and lower residential mortgage loan sales revenue, partially offset by higher service charges on deposits and debit card revenue.  The increase in noninterest expense in the comparison primarily resulted from investments in technology, higher personnel expense, and the impact of lower 2016 residential mortgage foreclosure-related expenses which included reserve releases.  Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product offerings that drive product value for consumers and small businesses. We are focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products.  The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market-specific deposit growth strategies and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In the first six months of 2017, average total deposits increased compared to the same period a year ago, driven by growth in savings deposits reflecting in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Additionally, demand deposits increased, partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit due to the net runoff of maturing accounts.  Retail Banking continued to focus on a relationship-based lending strategy. Average total loans increased in the comparison due to increases in residential mortgage and automobile loans partially offset by declines in home equity and commercial loans, as well as runoff of certain portfolios, as more fully described below.      •    Average residential mortgages increased as a result of new volumes exceeding portfolio liquidations.      •    Average automobile loans increased primarily due to portfolio growth in previously underpenetrated markets.      •    Average credit card balances increased as a result of organic growth as we continue to focus on delivering on our long-term objective of deepening penetration within our existing customer base.      •    Average home equity loans decreased as pay-downs and payoffs on loans exceeded new originated volume. Retail Banking’s home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with 98% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint. The weighted-average updated FICO scores for this portfolio were 748 at June 30, 2017 and 746 at December 31, 2016.      •    Average commercial and commercial real estate loans declined as pay-downs and payoffs on loans exceeded new volume.      •    In the first six months of 2017, average loan balances for the education and other loan portfolios decreased $783 million, or 10%, compared to same period in 2016, driven by declines in the government guaranteed education and indirect other portfolios, which are primarily runoff portfolios.  Nonperforming assets decreased compared to June 30, 2016 due to declines in both consumer and commercial nonperforming loans.  Retail Banking also continued to focus on the strategic priority of transforming the customer experience through transaction migration, branch network transformation, lending transformation and multi-channel engagement and service strategies.      •    In the first six months of 2017, approximately 61% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions compared with 57% for the same period a year ago.      •    Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 52% of total deposit transactions in the first six months of 2017 compared with 48% for the same period in 2016.      •    We had a network of 2,481 branches and 8,972 ATMs at June 30, 2017. Approximately 21% of the branch network operates under the universal model.      •    Instant debit card issuance, which enables us to print a customer’s debit card in minutes, was available in 89% of the branch network as of June 30, 2017.      •    Mortgage loan originations for the first six months of 2017 were down 9% compared to the same period in 2016.

(b) Represents loans serviced for PNC and others.    (c) Represents consolidated amounts. See the additional revenue discussion regarding treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities in the Product Revenue section of the Corporate & Institutional Banking portion of this Business Segments Review section.    (d) Includes amounts reported in net interest income and noninterest income, predominantly in corporate service fees.    (e) Includes other noninterest income for valuations on commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, derivative valuations, origination fees, gains on sale of loans held for sale and net interest income on loans held for sale.    (f) Includes net interest income and noninterest income (primarily in corporate services fees) from loan servicing net of reduction in commercial mortgage servicing rights due to time decay and payoffs. Commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge is shown separately.    (g) Amounts reported in corporate service fees.    (h) Includes nonperforming loans of $.5 billion at June 30, 2017 and $.7 billion at June 30, 2016.    Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $1.0 billion in the first six months of 2017 compared to $855 million for the same period in 2016. The increase of $147 million, or 17%, was primarily due to higher revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. We continue to focus on building client relationships where the risk-return profile is attractive.  Net interest income increased in the comparison, reflecting higher average loan balances as well as interest rate spread expansion on deposits.  Growth in noninterest income in the comparison was primarily driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and other capital markets-related revenue, including higher revenue from credit valuations on customer-related derivative activities and increased loan syndication fees, and higher treasury management fees.  The decrease in provision for credit losses in the comparison reflected lower provision for certain energy related loans in the oil, gas and coal sectors, partially offset by an initial provision for a loan and lease portfolio obtained through the acquisition of a commercial and vendor finance business in the second quarter of 2017.  Noninterest expense increased in the comparison largely driven by higher variable compensation commensurate with increased business activity, operating expense related to the acquired business and investments in technology and infrastructure.  Average loans increased in the comparison due to broad growth across many of our businesses:      •    Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to midsized and large corporations, government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business grew in the comparison reflecting increased lending to large corporate and middle market clients and strong production in specialty lending verticals.      •    PNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Higher average loans for this business were primarily due to growth in commercial real estate, both mortgage and project loans, as well as commercial loans.      •    PNC Business Credit provides asset-based lending. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by more liquid assets. Average loans for this business increased in the comparison as new originations and a slight increase in utilization were partially offset by payoffs.      •    PNC Equipment Finance provides equipment financing solutions for clients throughout the U.S. and Canada. Average loans, including commercial loans and finance leases, and operating leases were $13.8 billion in the first six months of 2017, an increase of $1.4 billion in the year-over-year comparison due to strong new production and the loan and lease portfolio obtained through our business acquisition.      •    Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business decreased in the comparison primarily due to the impact of capital management activities in 2016.  Growth in the commercial loan servicing portfolio was driven by servicing additions from new and existing customers exceeding portfolio runoff.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 17     Product Revenue  In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 11 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.  Treasury management revenue comprises fees and net interest income from customer deposit balances. Compared with the first six months of 2016, treasury management revenue increased due to liquidity-related revenue associated with customer deposit balances, including interest rate spread expansion, and higher fee income.  Capital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets advisory related services. Revenue from capital markets-related products and services increased in the comparison primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, higher revenue from credit valuations on customer-related derivative activities and increased loan syndication fees.  Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities increased slightly in the comparison as a higher benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, was mostly offset by a decline in commercial mortgage loan servicing income.     18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Asset Management Group   (Unaudited)  Table 12: Asset Management Group Table                            Six months ended June 30                        Change    Dollars in millions, except as noted   2017     2016            $     %     Income Statement                             Net interest income   $ 144     $ 153          $ (9 )      (6 )%    Noninterest income     435       416            19       5 %    Total revenue     579       569            10       2 %    Provision for credit losses (benefit)     (9 )      3            (12 )      (400 )%    Noninterest expense     432       412            20       5 %    Pretax earnings     156       154            2       1 %    Income taxes     57       57            –       –     Earnings   $ 99     $ 97             $ 2       2 %    Average Balance Sheet                             Loans                             Consumer   $ 5,101     $ 5,565          $ (464 )      (8 )%    Commercial and commercial real estate     719       778            (59 )      (8 )%    Residential mortgage     1,218       1,014            204       20 %    Total loans   $ 7,038     $ 7,357          $ (319 )      (4 )%    Total assets   $ 7,517     $ 7,822             $ (305 )      (4 )%    Deposits                             Noninterest-bearing demand   $ 1,519     $ 1,400          $ 119       9 %    Interest-bearing demand     3,766       4,183            (417 )      (10 )%    Money market     3,358       4,494            (1,136 )      (25 )%    Savings     3,769       1,783            1,986       111 %    Other     239       276            (37 )      (13 )%    Total deposits   $ 12,651     $ 12,136             $ 515       4 %    Performance Ratios                             Return on average assets     2.66 %      2.50 %                    Noninterest income to total revenue     75 %      73 %                    Efficiency     75 %      72 %                            Other Information                             Nonperforming assets (a) (b)   $ 49     $ 48          $ 1       2 %    Net charge-offs   $ 2     $ 6             $ (4 )      (67 )%    Client Assets Under Administration (in billions) (a) (c) (d)                             Discretionary client assets under management   $ 141     $ 135          $ 6       4 %    Nondiscretionary client assets under administration     125       117            8       7 %    Total   $ 266     $ 252             $ 14       6 %    Discretionary client assets under management                             Personal   $ 89     $ 84          $ 5       6 %    Institutional     52       51            1       2 %    Total   $ 141     $ 135             $ 6       4 %    Equity   $ 72     $ 66          $ 6       9 %    Fixed Income     49       47            2       4 %    Liquidity/Other     20       22            (2 )      (9 )%    Total   $ 141     $ 135             $ 6       4 %     (a) As of June 30.

(continued on following page)    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 19    (continued from previous page)      (d) Effective for the first quarter of 2017, we have adjusted nondiscretionary client assets under administration for prior periods to remove assets which, as a result of certain investment advisory services performed by one of our registered investment advisors, were previously reported as both discretionary client assets under management and nondiscretionary client assets under administration. Effective for the first quarter of 2017, these amounts are only reported as discretionary assets under management. The prior period presented was adjusted to remove approximately $9 billion as of June 30, 2016 previously included in nondiscretionary assets under administration. In addition, effective for the first quarter of 2017, we have refined our methodologies for allocating discretionary client assets under management by asset type. As a result, we have updated the presentation of discretionary client assets under management by asset type for the prior period presented.    Asset Management Group earned $99 million through the first six months of 2017 compared with earnings of $97 million for the first six months of 2016. Earnings increased as higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses was mostly offset by higher noninterest expense.  The increase in revenue in the comparison was driven by higher noninterest income due to stronger average equity markets. This increase was partially offset by lower net interest income due to lower average loan balances and interest rate spread compression within the loan portfolio.  The decrease in provision for credit losses in the comparison reflected lower provision on the consumer loan portfolio due to improved credit quality.  Noninterest expense increased in the first six months of 2017 compared to the prior year primarily attributable to higher compensation and technology expenses. Asset Management Group remains focused on disciplined expense management as it invests in strategic growth opportunities.  Asset Management Group’s strategy is focused on growing investable assets by continually evolving the client experience and products and services. The business offers an open architecture platform with a full array of investment products and banking solutions.  Wealth Management and Hawthorn have nearly 100 offices operating in seven out of the ten most affluent states in the U.S. with a majority co-located with retail banking branches. The businesses provide customized investments, wealth planning, trust and estate administration and private banking solutions to affluent individuals and ultra-affluent families.  Institutional Asset Management provides advisory, custody and retirement administration services to institutional clients such as corporations, unions, municipalities, non-profits, foundations and endowments. The business also offers PNC proprietary mutual funds and investment strategies. Institutional Asset Management is strengthening its partnership with Corporate & Institutional Banking to drive growth and is focused on building retirement capabilities and expanding product solutions for all customers.  Asset Management Group’s discretionary client assets under management increased in the comparison to the prior year, primarily attributable to higher equity markets as of June 30, 2017 and net business growth.

Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies  Nonperforming Assets  Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), other real estate owned (OREO), foreclosed and other assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K. A summary of the major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in Table 14.

Table 15: Change in Nonperforming Assets                In millions   2017     2016     January 1   $ 2,374     $ 2,425     New nonperforming assets     766       947     Charge-offs and valuation adjustments     (302 )      (319 )    Principal activity, including paydowns and payoffs     (389 )      (247 )    Asset sales and transfers to loans held for sale     (100 )      (166 )    Returned to performing status     (196 )      (125 )    June 30   $ 2,153     $ 2,515    As of June 30, 2017, approximately 85% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses in the event of default. As of June 30, 2017, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 53% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the ALLL.  Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 75% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at June 30, 2017, up from 70% at December 31, 2016. Home equity TDRs comprise 50% of home equity nonperforming loans at June 30, 2017 and 52% at December 31, 2016. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.  At June 30, 2017, our largest nonperforming asset was $45 million in the Mining, Quarrying and Oil and Gas Extraction Industry and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was less than $1 million. The ten largest individual nonperforming assets were from the commercial lending portfolio and represented 42% and 12% of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of June 30, 2017.  Loan Delinquencies  We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.

Accruing loans past due 90 days or more decreased at June 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 primarily driven by declines in government insured residential real estate, and government insured education loans within other consumer. Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed loans.  Home Equity and Auto Loan Portfolios  Home Equity Loan Portfolio  Our home equity loan portfolio totaled $29.2 billion as of June 30, 2017, or 13% of the total loan portfolio. Of that total, $17.2 billion, or 59%, were outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $12.0 billion, or 41%, consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans. Approximately 3% of the home equity portfolio was purchased impaired and 3% of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of June 30, 2017.  As of June 30, 2017, we were in an originated first lien position for approximately 58% of the total outstanding portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we held and serviced the first lien position for an additional 1% of the portfolio. The remaining 41% of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position. The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally based upon original LTV at the time of origination. We use an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.  We track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original LTVs and updated FICO scores at least quarterly, updated LTVs at least semi-annually, and other credit metrics   at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status, as well as the delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower (regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien).  In establishing our ALLL for non-impaired loans, we utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans. The roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state to the next delinquency state and ultimately to charge-off. The roll through to charge-off is based on our actual loss experience for each type of pool. Each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens. Our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools, used to establish our allowance, include losses on both first and second lien loans.  Generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20-year amortization term. During the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest only or principal and interest. We view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. The risk associated with the borrower’s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our ALLL. Based upon outstanding balances at June 30, 2017, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end.     22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Table 17: Home Equity Lines of Credit – Draw Period End Dates                In millions   Interest OnlyProduct     Principal andInterest Product     Remainder of 2017   $ 687     $ 181     2018     707       572     2019     493       441     2020     401       397     2021     422       610     2022 and thereafter     2,565       6,429     Total (a) (b)   $ 5,275     $ 8,630      (a) Includes all home equity lines of credit that mature in the remainder of 2017 or later, including those with borrowers where we have terminated borrowing privileges.    (b) Includes home equity lines of credit with balloon payments, including those where we have terminated borrowing privileges, of $15 million, $22 million, $17 million, $67 million, $61 million and $329 million with draw periods scheduled to end in the remainder of 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and thereafter, respectively.  Based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at June 30, 2017, for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw (e.g., draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 3% were 30-89 days past due and approximately 6% were 90 days or more past due, which are accounted for as nonperforming. Generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. At that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a TDR.  Auto Loan Portfolio  The auto loan portfolio totaled $12.5 billion as of June 30, 2017, or 6% of our total loan portfolio. Of that total, $11.0 billion resides in the indirect auto portfolio, $1.3 billion in the direct auto portfolio and $.2 billion in securitized portfolios. Indirect auto loan applications are generated from franchised automobile dealers. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail business.  We have elected not to pursue non-prime auto lending. Our average new loan origination FICO score over the last twelve months was 754 for indirect auto loans and 770 for direct auto loans. As of June 30, 2017, .5% of our auto loan portfolio was nonperforming and .5% of the portfolio was accruing past due. We offer both new and used automobile financing to customers through our various channels. The portfolio was composed of 55% new vehicle loans and 45% used vehicle loans at June 30, 2017.  The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio   by loan structure, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, loan-to-value and term.  Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings  Consumer Loan Modifications  We modify loans under government and PNC-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. Loans that are either temporarily or permanently modified under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as TDRs. Further, loans that have certain types of payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs.  A temporary modification, with a term between three and 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. Permanent modification programs generally result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, capitalization of past due amounts, interest-only period or deferral of principal.  We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our borrowers’ and servicing customers’ needs while mitigating credit losses. Table 18 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans at the end of each year presented.  Table 18: Consumer Real Estate Related Loan Modifications                            June 30, 2017     December 31, 2016    Dollars in millions   Number ofAccounts     UnpaidPrincipalBalance     Number ofAccounts     UnpaidPrincipalBalance     Temporary modifications     3,146     $ 226       3,484     $ 258     Permanent modifications     23,522       2,652       23,904       2,693     Total consumer real estate related loan modifications     26,668     $ 2,878       27,388     $ 2,951    Commercial Loan Modifications  Modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 23     Troubled Debt Restructurings  A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court imposed concessions (e.g., a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan).  Table 19: Summary of Troubled Debt Restructurings (a)                             June 30 2017      December 31 2016     Change    In millions       $     %     Total commercial lending   $ 488     $ 428     $ 60       14 %    Total consumer lending     1,718       1,793       (75 )      (4 )%    Total TDRs   $ 2,206     $ 2,221     $ (15 )      (1 )%    Nonperforming   $ 1,055     $ 1,112     $ (57 )      (5 )%    Accruing (b)     1,151       1,109       42       4 %    Total TDRs   $ 2,206     $ 2,221     $ (15 )      (1 )%     (a) Amounts in table represent recorded investment, which includes the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest and net accounting adjustments, less any charge-offs. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.   (b) Accruing loans include consumer credit card loans and loans that have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans.  Excluded from TDRs are $1.2 billion of consumer loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain government insured or guaranteed loans at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Nonperforming TDRs represented approximately 54% and 52% of total nonperforming loans and 48% and 50% of total TDRs at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual accounting after performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.  Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit  We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. Our total ALLL of $2.6 billion at June 30, 2017 consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in   loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.  We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.  Reserves are established for non-impaired commercial loan classes based on probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) credit risk ratings.  Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which generally demonstrate lower LGD compared to loans not secured by collateral. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our PDs and LGDs as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment.  Allocations to non-impaired consumer loan classes are primarily based upon a roll-rate model which uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off.  A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative and measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:      •    Industry concentrations and conditions,      •    Recent credit quality trends,      •    Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,      •    Recent macro-economic factors,      •    Model imprecision,      •    Changes in lending policies and procedures,      •    Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and      •    Limitations of available historical data.     24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL.  In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our ALLL.  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2016 Form 10-K and Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish the allowances.

The comparable amount for December 31, 2016 was 121%. These ratios are 97% and 89%, respectively, when excluding the $.7 billion of ALLL at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. We have excluded these amounts from ALLL in these ratios as these asset classes are not included in nonperforming loans. See Table 14 within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information.  The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. During the first six months of 2017, overall credit quality remained stable, which resulted in an essentially flat ALLL balance as of June 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.  The following table summarizes our loan charge-offs and recoveries.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 25     Residential Mortgage Repurchase Obligations  As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K, we have sold residential mortgage loans directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets. For additional information regarding our residential mortgage repurchase obligations, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2016 Form 10-K.  Liquidity and Capital Management  Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management section of our 2016 Form 10-K.  One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by dividing the amount of an institution’s high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA), as defined and calculated in accordance with the LCR rules, by its estimated net cash outflows, with net cash outflows determined by applying the assumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The resulting quotient is expressed as a percentage. The minimum LCR that PNC and PNC Bank are required to maintain is 100% in 2017. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR on a daily basis and as of June 30, 2017, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the fully phased-in requirement of 100%.  We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2016 Form 10-K.  Sources of Liquidity  Our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to $259.2 billion at June 30, 2017 from $257.2 billion at December 31, 2016, driven by higher consumer savings deposits, partially offset by lower money market deposits and commercial demand deposits. The overall   increase in savings deposits reflected in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Additionally, certain assets determined by us to be liquid and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position.  At June 30, 2017, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $27.2 billion and securities available for sale of $58.9 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Of our total liquid assets of $86.1 billion, we had $4.3 billion of securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $4.5 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.  We also obtain liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB advances) and short-term borrowings (Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings).  Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:  Table 22: Senior and Subordinated Debt            In billions   2017     January 1   $ 31.0     Issuances     4.1     Calls and maturities     (2.9 )    June 30   $ 32.2    Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At June 30, 2017, PNC Bank had $25.3 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $20.9 billion were senior bank notes and $4.4 billion were subordinated bank notes. The following table details issuances for the three months ended June 30, 2017.     26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table 23: PNC Bank Notes Issued During Second Quarter 2017            Issuance Date   Amount   Description of Issuance   May 19, 2017   $1.0 billion   Senior notes with a maturity date of May 19, 2020. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 2.000% on May 19 and November 19 of each year, beginning November 19, 2017.   May 19, 2017   $500 million   Floating rate senior notes with a maturity date of May 19, 2020. Interest is payable at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of .36% on February 19, May 19, August 19 and November 19 of each year, beginning on August 19, 2017.    See Note 15 Subsequent Events for information on the July issuances of $750 million of senior notes and $500 million of senior floating rate notes by PNC Bank.  PNC Bank is a member of the FHLB-Pittsburgh and, as such, has access to advances from FHLB-Pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage loans, other mortgage-related loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities. At June 30, 2017, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $26.8 billion with the FHLB-Pittsburgh. Total FHLB borrowings increased to $19 billion at June 30, 2017 compared with $17.5 billion at December 31, 2016 as draws outpaced maturities.  The FHLB-Pittsburgh also periodically provides standby letters of credit on behalf of PNC Bank to secure certain public deposits. If the FHLB-Pittsburgh is required to make payment for a beneficiary’s draw, the payment amount is converted into a collateralized advance to PNC Bank. At June 30, 2017, standby letters of credit issued on our behalf by the FHLB-Pittsburgh totaled $4.1 billion.  PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of June 30, 2017, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.  PNC Bank can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. These potential borrowings are secured by commercial loans. At June 30, 2017, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $17.8 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank.  Borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short-term and long-term funding sources. See Note 10 Borrowed Funds in our 2016 Form 10-K and the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review for additional information related to our Borrowings.  In addition to managing liquidity risk at the consolidated company level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund   discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions.  As of June 30, 2017, available parent company liquidity totaled $5.7 billion. Parent company liquidity is primarily held in intercompany short-term investments, the terms of which provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.  The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank, which may be impacted by the following:      •    Bank-level capital needs,      •    Laws and regulations,      •    Corporate policies,      •    Contractual restrictions, and      •    Other factors.  There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $1.3 billion at June 30, 2017. See Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these limitations.  In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. The parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of June 30, 2017, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding.  The parent company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which it can issue additional debt, equity and other capital instruments. Under this shelf registration statement, on May 19, 2017, the parent company issued $750 million in Senior Notes with a maturity date of May 19, 2027. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.150% per annum on May 19 and November 19 of each year, commencing on November 19, 2017.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 27     Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $6.9 billion at June 30, 2017 compared with $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016.  Contractual Obligations and Commitments  We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2016 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on our commitments in Note 13 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.  Credit Ratings  PNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short- and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain products.  In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. In addition, rating agencies themselves have been subject to scrutiny arising from the most recent financial crisis and could make or be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices, particularly in response to legislative and regulatory changes. Potential changes in the legislative and regulatory environment and the timing of those changes could impact our ratings, which as noted above, could impact our liquidity and financial condition. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.

We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.  In the second quarter of 2017, we repurchased 5.7 million common shares for $.7 billion, completing our common stock repurchase programs for the four quarter period that ended in June 2017. We returned a total of $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders through repurchases of 21.5 million common shares for $2.3 billion and dividends on common shares of $1.1 billion over the four quarter period, consistent with the capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve as part of our 2016 CCAR submission.  In connection with the 2017 CCAR process, we submitted our capital plan as approved by PNC’s Board of Directors, to the Federal Reserve in April 2017. The Federal Reserve accepted the capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions. As provided for in the 2017 capital plan, PNC announced new share repurchase programs of up to $2.7 billion for the four-quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2017, including repurchases of up to $.3 billion related to employee benefit plans.  We paid dividends on common stock of $.3 billion, or 55 cents per common share, during the second quarter of 2017. On July 6, 2017, the PNC Board of Directors raised the quarterly common stock cash dividend to 75 cents per share, an increase of 20 cents, or 36%, payable on August 5, 2017.

(b) PNC utilizes the pro forma fully phased-in Basel III capital ratios to assess its capital position (without the benefit of phase-ins), as these ratios represent the regulatory capital standards that will ultimately be applicable to PNC under the final Basel III rules. Pro forma fully phased-in capital amounts, ratios and risk-weighted and leverage-related assets are estimates.    (c) Basel III capital ratios and estimates may be impacted by additional regulatory guidance or analysis and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced approaches, may be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of PNC’s models integral to the calculation of advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.    (d) Includes credit and market risk-weighted assets.    (e) Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are estimated based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market and operational risk-weighted assets. During the parallel run qualification phase PNC has refined the data, models and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. We anticipate additional refinements to this estimate through the parallel run qualification phase.    (f) Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures including undrawn credit commitments and derivative potential future exposures.    (g) Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III capital ratio based on Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets and rules.    (h) For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimate is 11.0%. This capital ratio is calculated using pro forma fully phased-in Common equity Tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.    (i) For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio estimate is 12.3%. This capital ratio is calculated using fully phased-in Tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.    (j) For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Total capital risk-based capital ratio estimate is 13.7%. This ratio is calculated using fully phased-in Total Basel III capital, which under the advanced approaches, Additional Tier 2 capital includes allowance for loan and lease losses in excess of Basel expected credit losses, if any, up to 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.    (k) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.    (l) Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure. As advanced approaches banking organizations, PNC and PNC Bank will be subject to a 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio effective January 1, 2018.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29     As a result of the phase-in periods included in the final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules (Basel III rules), as well as the fact that we remain in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2017 are based on the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital under the Basel III rules (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2017) and the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Until we have exited parallel run, our regulatory risk-based Basel III ratios will be calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under Basel III (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in through 2019). Once we exit parallel run, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios will be the lower of the ratios calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches. We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions in effect for 2017 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as the 2017 Transitional Basel III ratios. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures, equity exposures and securitization exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.  Under the Basel III rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a phase-in schedule and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institution’s adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel III regulatory capital includes (subject to a phase-in schedule) accumulated other comprehensive income related to securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.  Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles and believe that our June 30, 2017 capital levels were aligned with them.  At June 30, 2017, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5%   for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.  We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 18 Regulatory Matters in our 2016 Form 10-K. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of this Report for details on our December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 Transitional Basel III and Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity tier 1 capital ratios.  Market Risk Management  Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others:      •    Traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,      •    Equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and      •    Fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and securities underwriting.  We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.  Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk  Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.  Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.     30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 follow: Table 26: Interest Sensitivity Analysis                     SecondQuarter2017     SecondQuarter2016     Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation (a)              Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over the following 12 months of:              100 basis point increase     2.8 %      3.1 %    100 basis point decrease     (3.3 )%      (3.2 )%    Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding 12 months of:              100 basis point increase     5.4 %      8.1 %    100 basis point decrease     (8.7 )%      (8.5 )%    Duration of Equity Model (a)              Base case duration of equity (in years)     (2.5 )      (8.5 )    Key Period-End Interest Rates              One-month LIBOR     1.22 %      .47 %    Three-year swap     1.75 %      .81 %     (a) Given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.  In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 27 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.  Table 27: Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Alternative Rate Scenarios (Second Quarter 2017)                         PNCEconomist     MarketForward     SlopeFlattening     First year sensitivity     1.5 %      1.0 %      (1.0 )%    Second year sensitivity     4.1 %      1.7 %      (4.4 )%   All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.  When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net   interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 26 and 27 above. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates.  The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.  Table 28: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward         The second quarter 2017 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions.  Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.  We use value-at-risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 were within our acceptable limits.  See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2016 Form 10-K for more information on our models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 31     Customer related trading revenue was $129 million for the first six months of 2017 compared with $89 million for the first six months of 2016. This increase was primarily due to changes in credit valuations for customer-related derivatives and improved derivative and foreign exchange client sales revenues.  Customer related trading revenue was $61 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared with $50 million for the second quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to changes in credit valuations for customer-related derivatives.  Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk  Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, securities underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.  Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.  A summary of our equity investments follows:  Table 29: Equity Investments Summary                             June 30 2017      December 31 2016     Change    In millions       $     %     BlackRock   $ 7,049     $ 6,886     $ 163       2 %    Tax credit investments     2,119       2,090       29       1 %    Private equity and other     1,651       1,752       (101 )      (6 )%    Total   $ 10,819     $ 10,728     $ 91       1 %   BlackRock  We owned approximately 35 million common stock equivalent shares of BlackRock equity at June 30, 2017, accounted for under the equity method. The primary risk measurement, similar to other equity investments, is economic capital. The Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review includes additional information about BlackRock.  Tax Credit Investments  Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $.7 billion at both June 30,   2017 and December 31, 2016. These unfunded commitments are included in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K has further information on Tax Credit Investments.  Private Equity and Other  The majority of our other equity investments consists of our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.3 billion at June 30, 2017 and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2017, $1.0 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.3 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. See Item 1 Business – Supervision and Regulation and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2016 Form 10-K for discussion of the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank on our interests in and of private funds covered by the Volcker Rule, including the five-year extension we received in February 2017 to conform certain equity investments subject to the Volcker Rule.  Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. At June 30, 2017, the estimated value of our investment in Visa Class B common shares was approximately $543 million and our cost basis was not significant. Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the settlement of the pending interchange litigation. See Note 6 Fair Value and Note 12 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our Visa agreements.  We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were not significant at June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016.  Financial Derivatives  We use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, options, forwards and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for interest rate risk management. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.     32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Periodic cash payments are exchanged for interest rate swaps, options and future contracts. Premiums are also exchanged for options contracts. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.  Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 6 Fair Value in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K and in Note 6 Fair Value and Note 9 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.  Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.  RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS  On June 28, 2017, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the 2017 CCAR exercise. As we previously announced, the Federal Reserve accepted the capital plan that PNC submitted in April 2017 and did not object to the capital actions included in that plan. See the Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.  On July 10, 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a final rule restricting the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class-action waiver clauses in the contracts for many consumer financial products and services. The rule will apply to pre-dispute arbitration agreements for covered products or services entered into on or after March 19, 2018. PNC is determining what changes will be required to our agreements with new customers after the compliance date.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  Note 1 Accounting Policies of our 2016 Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.  The following critical accounting policies and judgments are described in more detail in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in Item 7 of our 2016 Form 10-K:      •    Fair Value Measurements      •    Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit      •    Goodwill      •    Residential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights      •    Income Taxes  Goodwill  See the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in our first quarter 2017 Form 10-Q for information on our interim impairment test that was performed in connection with our segment realignment and in Item 7 of our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on our annual impairment test processes.  Fair Value Measurements  The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and the portions of such assets and liabilities that are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those where the fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs.     Table 30: Fair Value Measurements – Summary                            June 30, 2017     December 31, 2016    Dollars in millions   Total FairValue     Level 3     Total FairValue     Level 3     Total assets   $ 71,632     $ 7,647     $ 74,608     $ 8,830     Total assets at fair value as a percentage of consolidated assets     19 %            20 %          Level 3 assets as a percentage of total assets at fair value          11 %           12 %    Level 3 assets as a percentage of consolidated assets             2 %              2 %    Total liabilities   $ 4,133     $ 289     $ 4,818     $ 433     Total liabilities at fair value as a percentage of consolidated liabilities     1 %            2 %          Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities at fair value          7 %           9 %    Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of consolidated liabilities             <1 %              <1 %   The majority of assets recorded at fair value are included in the securities available for sale portfolio. The majority of Level 3 assets represent non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the available for sale portfolio, equity investments and mortgage servicing rights. For further information on fair value, see Note 6 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33     Recently Issued Accounting Standards  Revenue Recognition  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP with one accounting model. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the satisfaction of a performance obligation by transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the mandatory effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The requirements within ASU 2014-09 and its subsequent amendments should be applied either retrospectively to each prior period presented (with several practical expedients for certain completed contracts) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application (i.e., modified retrospective application). We plan to adopt the ASU consistent with the deferred mandatory effective date using the modified retrospective approach. Since the standard does not apply to revenue from loans, securities and other financial instruments, based on our evaluation to date, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position. We are still evaluating the presentation of certain in-scope revenue on the income statement related to our credit card business. We expect that the most significant impact related to the standard’s expanded disclosure requirements will be the disaggregation of revenue.  Financial Instruments  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU changes the accounting for certain equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Equity investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in net income. For an equity investment which does not have a readily determinable fair value, an election can be made to measure the investment at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes in value resulting from observable price changes in identical or similar instruments of the issuer. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment for these investments. Additionally, the ASU changes the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value and amends certain disclosure requirements relating to the fair   value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet, except for the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively. We plan to adopt all provisions consistent with the effective date and we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position.  Leases  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The primary change in the new guidance is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for operating leases. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating our complete lease population. We expect, at a minimum, to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets commensurate with the present value of the future minimum payments required under operating leases as disclosed in Note 8 Premises, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements in our 2016 Form 10-K. We do not expect a material change to the timing of our expense recognition.  Credit Losses  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires the use of an expected credit loss methodology; specifically, expected credit losses for the remaining life of the asset will be recognized at the time of origination or acquisition. The expected credit loss methodology will apply to loans, debt securities and other financial assets accounted for at amortized cost and net investment in leases not accounted for at fair value through net income. It will also apply to off-balance sheet credit exposures except for unconditionally cancellable commitments. Assets in the scope of the ASU, except for purchased credit deteriorated assets, will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the assets.  Enhanced credit quality disclosures will be required including disaggregation of credit quality indicators by vintage. The development of an expected credit loss methodology and new disclosures will require significant data collection, building or enhancing loss models, and process re-development prior to     34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      adoption. The ASU is effective for us for the first quarter of 2020 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We have established a company-wide, cross-functional governance structure. We continue to determine the required changes to our credit loss estimation methodologies, data and systems to be able to comply with the standard. We also continue to assess the impact of the standard; however, we expect the guidance will result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses to cover credit losses over the estimated life of the financial assets. The magnitude of the increase in our allowance for loan losses at the adoption date will be dependent upon the nature of the characteristics of the portfolio at the adoption date, as well as macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date.  Statement of Cash Flows  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The ASU provides guidance on eight specific issues related to classification within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice. The specific issues cover cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; cash outflows for settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant; contingent consideration payments that are not made soon after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests received in securitization transactions; and clarifies that when no specific GAAP guidance exists and the source of the cash flows are not separately identifiable, then the predominant source of cash flows should be used to determine the classification for the item. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. Based on our evaluation to date, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows.  Goodwill  In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment. This ASU eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill. Under Step 2, an entity had to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities as if those assets and liabilities had been acquired in a business   combination. Under the ASU, the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to impact our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position.  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements adopted in 2017.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  We engage in a variety of activities that involve entities that are not consolidated or otherwise reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. Additional information on these types of activities is included in our 2016 Form 10-K and in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities and Note 13 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.  A summary of variable interest entities (VIEs), including those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements, is included in Note 2 in our 2016 Form 10-K.  Trust Preferred Securities and REIT Preferred Securities  See Note 10 Borrowed Funds and Note 15 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K and Note 11 Total Equity and Other Comprehensive Income in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on trust preferred securities issued by PNC Capital Trust C and Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities (Perpetual Trust Securities) issued by PNC Preferred Funding Trust I and PNC Preferred Funding Trust II, including information on our March 15, 2017 redemption of the Perpetual Trust Securities and the related termination of the replacement capital covenants which had benefitted PNC Capital Trust C, as well as information on contractual limitations potentially imposed by PNC Capital Trust C on payments (including dividends) with respect to PNC’s securities.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 35     INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  As of June 30, 2017, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.  Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of June 30, 2017, and that there has been no change in PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the second quarter of 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  GLOSSARY OF TERMS  For a glossary of terms commonly used in our filings, please see the glossary of terms included in our 2016 Form 10-K.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  We make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance.  Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.    •    Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:      –    Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets.      –    Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets.      –    Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.      –    Changes in law and policy accompanying the new presidential administration and uncertainty or speculation pending the enactment of such changes.      –    Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness.      –    Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic expansion.      –    Continued residual effects of recessionary conditions and uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties, including adverse impacts on levels of unemployment, loan utilization rates, delinquencies, defaults and counterparty ability to meet credit and other obligations.      –    Commodity price volatility.      –    Changes in customer preferences and behavior, whether due to changing business and economic conditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors.    •    Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our current view that the U.S. economy and the labor market will grow moderately in 2017, boosted by stable oil/energy prices, improving consumer spending and housing activity, and some federal fiscal policy stimulus as a result of the 2016 elections. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected to continue rising in 2017; inflation has slowed in the first half of 2017, but should gradually accelerate into 2018. Specifically, our business outlook reflects our expectation of continued steady growth in GDP, one 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve in December of 2017, and an announcement from the Federal Reserve that it will begin to reduce the size of its balance sheet in the fall of 2017. We are also assuming that long-term rates rise at a slower pace than short-term rates. These forward-looking statements also do not, unless otherwise indicated, take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies.    •    Our ability to take certain capital actions, including paying dividends and any plans to increase common stock dividends, repurchase common stock under current or future programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, is subject to the review of such proposed actions by the Federal Reserve Board as part of our comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the Federal Reserve Board.     36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q       •    Our regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the international body responsible for developing global regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions), and management actions affecting the composition of our balance sheet. In addition, our ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.    •    Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:      –    Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, bank capital and liquidity standards, tax, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles.      –    Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to us.      –    Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.      –    Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.    •    Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.    •    Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings.    •    We grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and other liabilities. Acquisition risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.    •    Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.    •    Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.  We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2016 Form 10-K, our first quarter 2017 Form 10-Q, and elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in those reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.

Unaudited    BUSINESS  The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our primary geographic markets are located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Carolina. We also provide certain products and services internationally.  NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of Financial Statement Presentation  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned, certain partnership interests and variable interest entities.  We prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the 2017 presentation, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments needed to present fairly our results for the interim periods. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period.  We have also considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements.  When preparing these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, we have assumed that you have read the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note 1   Accounting Policies in the 2016 Form 10-K for a detailed description of significant accounting policies. There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies as disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These interim consolidated financial statements serve to update the 2016 Form 10-K and may not include all information and notes necessary to constitute a complete set of financial statements.  Use of Estimates  We prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Our most significant estimates pertain to our fair value measurements and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  We did not adopt any new accounting standards that had a significant impact during the second quarter of 2017.  NOTE 2 LOAN SALE AND SERVICING ACTIVITIES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  Loan Sale and Servicing Activities  As more fully described in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2016 Form 10-K, we have transferred residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have continuing involvement. Our continuing involvement generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans under certain conditions and loss share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization special purpose entities (SPEs).  We earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of loan transfer where we retain the servicing, we recognize a servicing right at fair value. See Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for information on our servicing rights, including the carrying value of servicing assets.

(d) Includes contractually specified servicing fees, late charges and ancillary fees.    (e) Represents cash flows on securities we hold issued by a securitization SPE in which we transferred to and/or services loans. The carrying values of such securities held were $7.2 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $.7 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities at June 30, 2017 and $6.4 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $1.1 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities at June 30, 2016. Additionally, at December 31, 2016, the carrying values of such securities held were $6.9 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $.9 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities.  Table 32 presents information about the principal balances of transferred loans that we service and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would only experience a loss on these transferred loans if we were required to repurchase a loan due to a breach in representations and warranties or a loss sharing arrangement associated with our continuing involvement with these loans.

(c) Net charge-offs for Residential mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported to investors during the period. Net charge-offs for Commercial mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported by the trustee for commercial mortgage backed securitizations. Realized losses for Agency securitizations are not reflected as we do not manage the underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to loss information.     44 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)  As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2016 Form 10-K, we are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be VIEs.  The following table provides a summary of non-consolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement but are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consider our continuing involvement to be significant when it relates to a VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or where no transfers have occurred between us and the VIE. We have excluded certain transactions with non-consolidated VIEs from the balances presented in Table 33 where we have determined that our continuing involvement is not significant. In addition, where we only have lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these transactions with non-consolidated entities from the balances presented in Table 33. These loans are included as part of the asset quality disclosures that we make in Note 3 Asset Quality.

Values disclosed in the PNC Risk of Loss column represent our maximum exposure to loss for those securities’ holdings.    (c) Included in Investment securities, Mortgage servicing rights and Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (d) Included in Investment securities, Loans, Equity investments and Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (e) Included in Deposits and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We make certain equity investments in various tax credit limited partnerships or limited liability companies (LLCs). The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we recognized $.1 billion of amortization, $.1 billion of tax credits, and $42 million of other tax benefits associated with qualified investments in low income housing tax credits within Income taxes. The amounts for the second quarter of 2017 were $57 million, $61 million and $21 million, respectively.  NOTE 3 ASSET QUALITY  We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates may be a key indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the loan portfolios. The measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale, purchased impaired loans, nonperforming loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option which are on nonaccrual status, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and accruing loans accounted for under the fair value option.  Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO, foreclosed and other assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans as these loans are accounted for at fair value. However, when nonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is not recognized on these loans. Additionally, certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest. Purchased impaired loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on our loan related policies.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 45    The following tables display the delinquency status of our loans and our nonperforming assets at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

Recorded investment in a loan includes the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest and net accounting adjustments, less any charge-offs. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.    (b) Past due loan amounts exclude purchased impaired loans, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed Residential real estate mortgages totaling $.5 billion and $.6 billion and Education and other consumer loans totaling $.3 billion and $.4 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.    (c) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option for which we do not expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are subject to nonaccrual accounting and classification upon meeting any of our nonaccrual policies. Given that these loans are not accounted for at amortized cost, these loans have been excluded from the nonperforming loan population.    (d) Net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees, unamortized discounts & premiums and purchase discounts & premiums totaling $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.    46 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     At June 30, 2017, we pledged $22.1 billion of commercial loans to the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and $61.8 billion of residential real estate and other loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) as collateral for the contingent ability to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2016 were $22.0 billion and $60.8 billion, respectively.

(b) The recorded investment of loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure was $.4 billion at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which included $.2 billion of loans that are government insured/guaranteed.  Nonperforming loans also include certain loans whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are considered TDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2016 Form 10-K and the TDR section of this Note 3.  Total nonperforming loans in Table 35 include TDRs of $1.1 billion at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. TDRs that are performing, including consumer credit card TDR loans, totaled $1.1 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and are excluded from nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are returned to accrual status and classified as performing after demonstrating a period of at least six months of consecutive performance under the restructured terms. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. See the TDRs section of this Note 3 for more information on TDRs.  Additional Asset Quality Indicators  We have two overall portfolio segments – Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending. Each of these two segments comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in initial measurement, risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. The Commercial Lending segment is composed of the commercial, commercial real estate and equipment lease financing loan classes. The Consumer Lending segment is composed of the home equity, residential real estate, credit card and other consumer loan classes.  Commercial Lending Asset Classes  The following table presents asset quality indicators for the Commercial Lending asset classes. See Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information related to our Commercial Lending asset classes, including discussion around the asset quality indicators that we use to monitor and manage the credit risk associated with each loan class.

We use PDs and LGDs to rate commercial loans and apply a split rating classification to certain loans meeting threshold criteria. By assigning a split classification, a loan’s exposure amount may be split into more than one classification category in this table.    (b) Special Mention rated loans have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of repayment prospects at some future date. These loans do not expose us to sufficient risk to warrant a more adverse classification at the reporting date.  (continued on following page)    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 47    (continued from previous page)      (c) Substandard rated loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.    (d) Doubtful rated loans possess all the inherent weaknesses of a Substandard loan with the additional characteristics that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full improbable due to existing facts, conditions and values.  Consumer Lending Asset Classes  See Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information related to our Consumer Lending asset classes, including discussion around the asset quality indicators that we use to monitor and manage the credit risk associated with each loan class.  Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loan Classes  The following table presents asset quality indicators for home equity and residential real estate balances, excluding consumer purchased impaired loans of $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and government insured or guaranteed residential real estate mortgages of $.8 billion at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

The following states had the highest percentage of higher risk loans at June 30, 2017: New Jersey 16%, Pennsylvania 13%, Illinois 12%, Ohio 9%, Maryland 8%, Florida 6%, Michigan 5% and North Carolina 4%. The remainder of the states had lower than 4% of the higher risk loans individually, and collectively they represent approximately 27% of the higher risk loans. The following states had the highest percentage of higher risk loans at December 31, 2016: New Jersey 16%, Pennsylvania 14%, Illinois 12%, Ohio 10%, Florida 7%, Maryland 6%, Michigan 4% and North Carolina 4%.

We use internal credit metrics, such as delinquency status, geography or other factors, as an asset quality indicator for government guaranteed or insured education loans and consumer loans to high net worth individuals, as internal credit metrics are more relevant than FICO scores for these types of loans.    (b) Credit card loans and other consumer loans with no FICO score available or required generally refers to new accounts issued to borrowers with limited credit history, accounts for which we cannot obtain an updated FICO score (e.g., recent profile changes), cards issued with a business name and/or cards secured by collateral. Management proactively assesses the risk and size of this loan portfolio and, when necessary, takes actions to mitigate the credit risk. Weighted-average updated FICO score excludes accounts with no FICO score available or required.  Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)  Table 39 quantifies the number of loans that were classified as TDRs as well as the change in the loans’ recorded investment as a result of becoming a TDR during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016. Additionally, the table provides information about the types of TDR concessions. See Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional discussion of TDRs.

(b) Represents the recorded investment of the loans as of the quarter end prior to TDR designation, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable.    (c) Represents the recorded investment of the TDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the TDR occurs, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable.  After a loan is determined to be a TDR, we continue to track its performance under its most recent restructured terms. We consider a TDR to have subsequently defaulted when it becomes 60 days past due after the most recent date the loan was restructured. The recorded investment of loans that were both (i) classified as TDRs or were subsequently modified during each 12-month period preceding January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2016, respectively, and (ii) subsequently defaulted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $42 million and $68 million, respectively. The comparable amounts for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $38 million and $59 million, respectively.  Impaired Loans  Impaired loans include commercial and consumer nonperforming loans and TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. TDRs that were previously recorded at amortized cost and are now classified and accounted for as held for sale are also included. Excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans accounted for as held for sale other than the TDRs described in the preceding sentence, loans accounted for under the fair value option, smaller balance homogeneous type loans and purchased impaired loans. We did not recognize any interest income on impaired loans that have not returned to performing status, while they were impaired during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016. The following table provides further detail on impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment and the associated ALLL. Certain commercial and consumer impaired loans do not have a related ALLL as the valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the recorded investment.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 51    NOTE 4 ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES  We maintain the ALLL at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the portfolios as of the balance sheet date. We use the two main portfolio segments – Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending, and develop and document the ALLL under separate methodologies for each of these portfolio segments. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2016 Form 10-K for a description of the accounting policies for ALLL. A rollforward of the ALLL and associated loan data follows.

Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in Shareholders’ equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, unless credit-related. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At June 30, 2017, Accumulated other comprehensive income included pretax gains of $61 million from derivatives that hedged the purchase of investment securities classified as held to maturity. The gains will be accreted into interest income as an adjustment of yield on the securities.  Table 43 presents gross unrealized losses and fair value of debt securities at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The securities are segregated between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. The table includes debt securities where a portion of OTTI has been recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

On at least a quarterly basis, we review all debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position for OTTI, as discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies of the 2016 Form 10-K. For those securities on our balance sheet at June 30, 2017, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represented OTTI, we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.1 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities.  The majority of these cumulative impairment charges related to non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities rated BB or lower. During 2017 and 2016, the OTTI credit losses recognized in noninterest income and the OTTI noncredit losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on securities were not significant.  Information relating to gross realized securities gains and losses from the sales of securities is set forth in the following table:  Table 44: Gains (Losses) on Sales of Securities Available for Sale                             Six months ended June 30 In millions    Proceeds      Gross Gains      Gross Losses      Net Gains      Tax Expense     2017   $ 3,526     $ 29     $ (18 )    $ 11     $ 4     2016   $ 2,093     $ 14     $ (1 )    $ 13     $ 5        The following table presents, by remaining contractual maturity, the amortized cost, fair value and weighted-average yield of debt securities at June 30, 2017.

NOTE 6 FAIR VALUE  Fair Value Measurement  We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date, determined using an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value hierarchy established by GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy see Note 6 Fair Value in our 2016 Form 10-K.  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  For more information on the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, see Note 6 Fair Value in our 2016 Form 10-K. The following table summarizes our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including instruments for which we have elected the fair value option.     56 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table 47: Fair Value Measurements – Recurring Basis Summary                                            June 30, 2017     December 31, 2016    In millions   Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     TotalFair Value     Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     TotalFair Value     Assets                                            Residential mortgage loans held for sale        $ 845     $ 5     $ 850          $ 1,008     $ 2     $ 1,010     Commercial mortgage loans held for sale               982       982                 1,400       1,400     Securities available for sale                                            U.S. Treasury and government agencies   $ 12,588       597            13,185     $ 12,572       602            13,174     Residential mortgage-backed                                            Agency          26,347            26,347            26,128            26,128     Non-agency          104       2,964       3,068            112       3,254       3,366     Commercial mortgage-backed                                            Agency          1,863            1,863            2,119            2,119     Non-agency          3,232            3,232            4,025            4,025     Asset-backed          5,626       361       5,987            5,565       403       5,968     Other debt             4,629       78       4,707               4,657       66       4,723     Total debt securities     12,588       42,398       3,403       58,389       12,572       43,208       3,723       59,503     Corporate stocks and other     428       61               489       541       60               601     Total securities available for sale     13,016       42,459       3,403       58,878       13,113       43,268       3,723       60,104     Loans          529       290       819            558       335       893     Equity investments (a)               987       1,259                 1,331       1,381     Residential mortgage servicing rights               1,249       1,249                 1,182       1,182     Commercial mortgage servicing rights               618       618                 576       576     Trading securities (b)     1,067       2,018       2       3,087       1,458       1,169       2       2,629     Financial derivatives (b) (c)     4       3,230       22       3,256       10       4,566       40       4,616     Other     272       273       89       634       266       312       239       817     Total assets   $ 14,359     $ 49,354     $ 7,647     $ 71,632     $ 14,847     $ 50,881     $ 8,830     $ 74,608     Liabilities                                            Other borrowed funds   $ 1,170     $ 227     $ 8     $ 1,405     $ 799     $ 161     $ 10     $ 970     Financial derivatives (c) (d)     2       2,445       248       2,695       1       3,424       414       3,839     Other liabilities                     33       33                       9       9     Total liabilities   $ 1,172     $ 2,672     $ 289     $ 4,133     $ 800     $ 3,585     $ 433     $ 4,818      (a) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

(c) Net gains (losses) realized and unrealized included in earnings related to Level 3 assets and liabilities included amortization and accretion. The amortization and accretion amounts were included in Interest income on the Consolidated Income Statement and the remaining net gains (losses) realized and unrealized were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.    (d) Net unrealized gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.    (e) Reflects transfers into and out of Level 3 associated with changes in valuation methodology for certain equity investments subject to the Volcker Rule provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  An instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. Our policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of the reporting period.

Mortgage Servicing Rights  We recognize the right to service mortgage loans for others when we recognize it as an intangible asset and the servicing income we receive is more than adequate compensation. MSRs totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and consisted of loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential mortgages measured at fair value.  MSRs are subject to declines in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of MSRs decreases (or increases).  See the Sensitivity Analysis section of this Note 7, as well as Note 6 Fair Value in our 2016 Form 10-K for more detail on our fair value measurement of MSRs. Refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights in our 2016 Form 10-K for more information on our accounting and measurement of MSRs.

(b) Represents MSR value changes resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates.  Sensitivity Analysis  The fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of June 30, 2017 are shown in Tables 56 and 57. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses both internal proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate.  A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented in Tables 56 and 57. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.  The following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and the sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions.

We also generate servicing fees from fee-based activities provided to others for which we do not have an associated servicing asset. Fees from commercial and residential MSRs are reported on our Consolidated Income Statement in the line items Corporate services and Residential mortgage, respectively.     NOTE 8 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  Pension and Postretirement Plans  As described in Note 11 Employee Benefit Plans in our 2016 Form 10-K, we have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Any pension contributions to the plan are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants.  We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. We reserve the right to terminate or make changes to these plans at any time. The nonqualified pension plan is unfunded.  The components of our net periodic benefit cost for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were as follows:  Table 58: Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost                                    Qualified Pension Plan     Nonqualified RetirementPlans     Postretirement Benefits     Three months ended June 30 In millions   2017     2016     2017     2016     2017     2016     Net periodic cost consists of:                                    Service cost   $ 25     $ 25          $ 1     $ 1     $ 2     Interest cost     44       47     $ 3       3       3       3     Expected return on plan assets     (71 )      (71 )                 (1 )      (1 )    Amortization of prior service credit     (1 )      (1 )                 (1 )      (1 )    Amortization of actuarial losses     10       11       1       1                     Net periodic cost/(benefit)   $ 7     $ 11     $ 4     $ 5     $ 2     $ 3                                      Qualified Pension Plan     Nonqualified RetirementPlans     Postretirement Benefits     Six months ended June 30 In millions   2017     2016     2017     2016     2017     2016     Net periodic cost consists of:                                    Service cost   $ 51     $ 51     $ 1     $ 1     $ 2     $ 3     Interest cost     89       93       6       6       7       7     Expected return on plan assets     (142 )      (141 )                 (2 )      (2 )    Amortization of prior service credit     (2 )      (3 )                 (1 )      (1 )    Amortization of actuarial losses     22       22       2       2                     Net periodic cost/(benefit)   $ 18     $ 22     $ 9     $ 9     $ 6     $ 7      68 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    NOTE 9 FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES  We use derivative financial instruments primarily to help manage exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk and reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.  For more information regarding derivatives see Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K.  The following table presents the notional amounts and gross fair values of all derivative assets and liabilities held by us.

(b) Included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (c) Represents primarily swaps.    (d) In the first quarter of 2017, PNC changed its accounting treatment for variation margin related to certain derivative instruments cleared through a central clearing house. Previously, variation margin was treated as collateral subject to offsetting. As a result of changes made by the clearing house to its rules governing such instruments with its counterparties, effective for the first quarter of 2017, variation margin will be treated as a settlement payment on the derivative instrument. The impact at June 30, 2017 was a reduction of gross derivative assets and gross derivative liabilities by $.9 billion and $.7 billion, respectively. The accounting change had no impact on the net fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities that otherwise would have been reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Table 63 for more information.    (e) Includes both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities.    (f) Futures contracts settle in cash daily and, therefore, no derivative asset or derivative liability is recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (g) Includes our obligation to fund a portion of certain BlackRock LTIP programs and the swaps entered into in connection with sales of a portion of Visa Class B common shares.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 69     All derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion regarding the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable master netting agreements is included in the Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk and Contingent Features section below. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of the derivatives.  Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAP  Certain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of   expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and losses on those derivatives, to the extent effective, to be recognized in the income statement in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.  Fair Value Hedges  We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. For these hedge relationships, we use statistical regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for all periods presented.     Further detail regarding gains (losses) on fair value hedge derivatives and related hedged items is presented in the following table:  Table 60: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives and Related Hedged Items – Fair Value Hedges                                                        Three months ended     Six months ended                June 30, 2017     June 30, 2016     June 30, 2017     June 30, 2016    In millions   Hedged Items   Location   Gain(Loss) onDerivativesRecognizedin Income     Gain (Loss)on RelatedHedgedItemsRecognizedin Income     Gain(Loss) onDerivativesRecognizedin Income     Gain (Loss)on RelatedHedgedItemsRecognizedin Income     Gain(Loss) onDerivativesRecognizedin Income     Gain (Loss)on RelatedHedgedItemsRecognizedin Income     Gain(Loss) onDerivativesRecognizedin Income     Gain (Loss)on RelatedHedgedItemsRecognizedin Income     Interest rate contracts   U.S. Treasury and Government Agencies and Other Debt Securities   Investment securities (interest income)   $ (34 )    $ 33     $ (55 )    $ 56     $ (12 )    $ 12     $ (209 )    $ 214     Interest rate contracts   Subordinated Debt and Bank Notes and Senior Debt   Borrowed funds (interest expense)     67       (75 )      155       (168 )      (28 )      11       562       (600 )    Total (a)           $ 33     $ (42 )    $ 100     $ (112 )    $ (40 )    $ 23     $ 353     $ (386 )     (a) The difference between the gains (losses) recognized in income on derivatives and their related hedged items represents the ineffective portion of the change in value of our fair value hedge derivatives.    Cash Flow Hedges  We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. For these cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are effective in offsetting changes in the forecasted interest cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are reclassified to interest income in conjunction with the recognition of interest received on the loans. We use statistical regression analysis to assess the effectiveness of these hedge relationships at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis.  We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the consideration that will be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. As a result, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is typically minimal. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings.     70 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     In the 12 months that follow June 30, 2017, we expect to reclassify net derivative gains of $151 million pretax, or $97 million after-tax, from Accumulated other comprehensive income to interest income for both cash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is seven years. During the first six months of 2017 and 2016, there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified to earnings because it became probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.  There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to either cash flow hedge strategy for all periods presented.  Further detail regarding gains (losses) on derivatives and related cash flows is presented in the following table:  Table 61: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives and Related Cash Flows – Cash Flow Hedges (a) (b)                             Three months ended June 30      Six months ended June 30    In millions    2017       2016       2017       2016      Gains (losses) on derivatives recognized in OCI – (effective portion)   $ 39     $ 126     $ 17     $ 391     Less: Gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income – (effective portion)                        Interest income     49       64       101       129     Noninterest income             (1 )      3       (1 )    Total gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income – (effective portion)   $ 49     $ 63     $ 104     $ 128     Net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives   $ (10 )    $ 63     $ (87 )    $ 263      (a) All cash flow hedge derivatives are interest rate contracts as of June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016.    (b) The amount of cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recognized in income was not significant for the periods presented.  Net Investment Hedges  We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded   from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for all periods presented. During the first six months of 2017 and 2016, there was no net investment hedge ineffectiveness. Gains (losses) on net investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI were net losses of $(36) million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and net losses of $(50) million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with net gains of $80 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and net gains of $109 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAP  We also enter into derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. For additional information on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP see Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our 2016 Form 10-K.  Further detail regarding the gains (losses) on derivatives not designated in hedging relationships is presented in the following table:  Table 62: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives Not Designated for Hedging under GAAP                             Three months ended June 30      Six months ended June 30    In millions   2017     2016     2017     2016     Derivatives used for mortgage banking activities:                        Interest rate contracts (a)   $ 80     $ 172     $ 73     $ 413     Derivatives used for customer-related activities:                        Interest rate contracts   $ 19     $ 1     $ 53     $ (3 )    Foreign exchange contracts and other     40       17       72       46     Gains (losses) from customer-related activities (b)   $ 59     $ 18     $ 125     $ 43     Derivatives used for other risk management activities:                        Foreign exchange contracts and other (c)   $ (106 )    $ 4     $ (156 )    $ (95 )    Gains (losses) from other risk management activities (b)   $ (106 )    $ 4     $ (156 )    $ (95 )    Total gains (losses) from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments   $ 33     $ 194     $ 42     $ 361      (a) Included in Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Other noninterest income.    (b) Included in Other noninterest income.    (c) Includes BlackRock LTIP funding obligation and the swaps entered into in connection with sales of a portion of Visa Class B common shares.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 71    Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk and Contingent Features  We generally utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either party’s net position. For additional information on derivative offsetting, counterparty credit risk and contingent features see Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our 2016 Form 10-K.  Table 63 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements.

The accounting change reduced the asset and liability gross fair values with corresponding reductions to the fair value and cash collateral offsets, resulting in no changes to the net fair value amounts.    (b) Represents the net amount of derivative assets included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (c) Represents the net amount of derivative liabilities included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    72 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Table 63 includes over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, cleared derivatives and exchange-traded derivatives. OTC derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties that are not settled through an organized exchange or cleared through a central clearing house. The majority of OTC derivatives are governed by ISDA documentation or other legally enforceable industry standard master netting agreements. Cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes our counterparty. Exchange-traded derivatives represent standardized futures and options contracts executed directly on an organized exchange.  In addition to using master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to reduce credit risk associated with derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using internal credit analysis, limits and monitoring procedures.  At June 30, 2017, we held cash, U.S. government securities and mortgage-backed securities totaling $.7 billion under master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from counterparties, and we pledged cash totaling $1.5 billion under these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities owed to counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements. These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals may include collateral exchanged   under an agreement that does not qualify as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral held or pledged exceeds the net derivative fair values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held from counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise securities we have pledged to counterparties remain on our balance sheet.  Certain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk related contingent provisions, such as those that require our debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position on June 30, 2017 was $1.0 billion for which we had posted collateral of $.6 billion in the normal course of business. The maximum additional amount of collateral we would have been required to post if the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on June 30, 2017 would be $.4 billion.

(b) The par value of our preferred stock outstanding was less than $.5 million at each date and, therefore, is excluded from this presentation.    Warrants  We had 5.1 million, 11.3 million, and 13.4 million warrants outstanding at June 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of PNC common stock at an exercise price of $67.33 per share. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, the warrants are exercised on a non-cash net basis with the warrant holder receiving PNC common shares determined based on the excess of the market price of PNC common stock on the exercise date over the exercise price of the warrant. The outstanding warrants will expire as of December 31, 2018 and are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share in Note 10 Earnings Per Share in this Report.  On July 6, 2017, PNC declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $.75 per share to shareholders of record as of July 17, 2017. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, the declaration of a dividend in excess of $.66 per share may result in an adjustment to the warrant exercise price and to the warrant share number. As a result of this dividend, the warrant exercise price was reduced from $67.33 to $67.28 per share on July 17, 2017 and the warrant share number remained 1.00.  Noncontrolling Interests  Perpetual Trust Securities  Our noncontrolling interests balance at June 30, 2017 reflected our March 15, 2017 redemption of $1.0 billion Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Exchangeable Perpetual Trust Securities issued by PNC Preferred Funding Trusts I and II with current distribution rates of 2.61% and 2.19%, respectively. The Perpetual Trust Securities were subject to replacement capital covenants dated December 6, 2006 and March 29, 2007 benefiting PNC Capital Trust C as the sole holder of $200 million of junior subordinated debentures issued by PNC in June 1998. Upon redemption of the Perpetual Trust Securities, the replacement capital covenants terminated and such debentures ceased being covered debt with respect to the replacement capital covenants.     74

regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings (“Disclosed Matters,” which are those matters disclosed in this Note 12 as well as those matters disclosed in Note 19 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our 2016 Form 10-K and in Note 12 Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our first quarter 2017 Form 10-Q (such prior disclosure collectively referred to as “Prior Disclosure”)). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, as of June 30, 2017, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $425 million. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount.  As a result of the types of factors described in Note 19 in our 2016 Form 10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that it is reasonably possible that we could incur or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as discussed below under “Other.”  We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information related to the plaintiff’s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff’s pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual.  Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses.  Fulton Financial  In the case pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the caption Fulton Financial Advisors, N.A. v. NatCity Investments, Inc. (No. 5:09-cv-04855), the court has scheduled the case for trial in February 2018.     76 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Mortgage Repurchase Litigation  In March 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in ResCap Liquidating Trust v. PNC Bank, N.A. (No. 17-cv-196-JRT-FLN), which has been consolidated for pre-trial purposes into In Re: RFC and RESCAP Liquidating Trust Litigation (Civil File No. 13-cv-3451 (SRN/JJK/HB)) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. In July 2017, the court denied the motion.  Other Regulatory and Governmental Inquiries  We are the subject of investigations, audits and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a broad range of issues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage, securities and other financial services businesses, as well as other aspects of our operations. In some cases, these inquiries are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at PNC individually. These inquiries, including those described in Prior Disclosure, may lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, and possibly result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs and other consequences. These inquiries may result in significant reputational harm or other adverse collateral consequences even if direct resulting remedies are not material to us.  Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries, including those described in Prior Disclosure.  Other  In addition to the proceedings or other matters described above and in Prior Disclosure, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.  NOTE 13 COMMITMENTS  In the normal course of business, we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table presents our outstanding commitments to extend credit along with significant other commitments as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  Table 68: Commitments to Extend Credit and Other Commitments                In millions    June 30 2017     December 312016     Commitments to extend credit              Total commercial lending   $ 107,152     $ 108,256     Home equity lines of credit     17,763       17,438     Credit card     23,345       22,095     Other     4,921       4,192     Total commitments to extend credit     153,181       151,981     Net outstanding standby letters of credit (a)     8,371       8,324     Reinsurance agreements (b)     1,726       1,835     Standby bond purchase agreements (c)     916       790     Other commitments (d)     950       967     Total commitments to extend credit and other commitments   $ 165,144     $ 163,897      (a) Net outstanding standby letters of credit include $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which support remarketing programs.    (b) Represents aggregate maximum exposure up to the specified limits of the reinsurance contracts and reflects estimates based on availability of financial information from insurance carriers. As of June 30, 2017, the aggregate maximum exposure amount comprised $1.5 billion for accidental death & dismemberment contracts and $.2 billion for credit life, accident & health contracts. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2016 were $1.5 billion and $.3 billion, respectively.    (c) We enter into standby bond purchase agreements to support municipal bond obligations.    (d) Includes $.5 billion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.  Commitments to Extend Credit  Commitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee and contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates.  Net Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit  We issue standby letters of credit and share in the risk of standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to support obligations of our customers to third parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of transactions involving capital markets product execution. Approximately 91% and 94% of our net outstanding standby letters of credit were rated as Pass as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, with the remainder rated as Below Pass. An internal credit rating of Pass indicates the     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 77      expected risk of loss is currently low, while a rating of Below Pass indicates a higher degree of risk.  If the customer fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract or there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them. The standby letters of credit outstanding on June 30, 2017 had terms ranging from less than 1 year to 8 years.  As of June 30, 2017, assets of $1.2 billion secured certain specifically identified standby letters of credit. In addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit issued on behalf of specific customers is also secured by collateral or guarantees that secure the customers’ other obligations to us. The carrying amount of the liability for our obligations related to standby letters of credit and participations in standby letters of credit was $.2 billion at June 30, 2017 and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  NOTE 14 SEGMENT REPORTING  Effective for the first quarter of 2017, as a result of changes to how we manage our businesses, we realigned our segments and, accordingly, have changed the basis of presentation of our segments, resulting in four reportable business segments:      •    Retail Banking      •    Corporate & Institutional Banking      •    Asset Management Group      •    BlackRock  Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors. Effective for the first quarter of 2017, we made certain adjustments to our internal funds transfer pricing methodology primarily relating to weighted average lives of certain non-maturity deposits based on our recent historical experience. These changes in methodology affected business segment results, primarily adversely impacting net interest income for Corporate & Institutional Banking and Retail Banking, offset by increased net interest income in the “Other” category.  Prior periods presented were revised to conform to the new segment alignment and to our change in internal funds transfer pricing methodology.  Results of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the   financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period.  Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category in the business segment tables. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities and certain trading activities, exited businesses, certain non-strategic runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments’ results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented for comparative purposes.  Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the results for corporate support functions within “Other” for financial reporting purposes.  Our allocation of the costs incurred by shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services.  A portion of capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to our business segments using our risk-based economic capital model, including consideration of the goodwill at those business segments, as well as the diversification of risk among the business segments, ultimately reflecting our portfolio risk adjusted capital allocation.  We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on the loan exposures within each business segment’s portfolio. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.     78 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Business Segment Products and Services  Retail Banking provides deposit, lending, brokerage, investment management and cash management products and services to consumer and small business customers within our primary geographic markets.

To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2016 were $54 million, $52 million, and $48 million, respectively. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were $106 million and $96 million, respectively.

(b) PNC utilizes the pro forma fully phased-in Basel III capital ratios, to assess its capital position (without the benefit of phase-ins), as these ratios represent the regulatory capital standards that will ultimately be applicable to PNC under the final Basel III rules.    (c) Basel III capital ratios and estimates may be impacted by additional regulatory guidance and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced approaches, may be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of PNC’s models that are integral to the calculation of advanced approaches risk-weighted assets as PNC moves through the parallel run process.    (d) Represents net adjustments related to accumulated other comprehensive income for securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.    (e) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.    (f) Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market and operational risk-weighted assets. During the parallel run qualification phase PNC has refined the data, models and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. We anticipate additional refinements may result in increases or decreases to this estimate through the parallel run qualification phase.    84 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     PART II – OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1.
