(b) The effective income tax rates are generally lower than the statutory rate due to the relationship of pretax income to tax credits and earnings that are not subject to tax.    (c) Calculated as annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins for all earning assets, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the Consolidated Income Statement. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 were $48 million and $49 million, respectively. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 were $96 million and $98 million, respectively.

(PNC) is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  We have businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management and residential mortgage banking, providing many of our products and services nationally, as well as other products and services in our primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Virginia, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Carolina. We also provide certain products and services internationally.  Key Strategic Goals  At PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and fee revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our corporate responsibility to the communities where we do business.  We strive to expand and deepen customer relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, fee-based and credit products and services. We are focused on delivering those products and services where, when and how our customers choose with the goal of offering insight that addresses their specific financial objectives. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships that meet our risk/return measures. Our strategies for growing fee income across our lines of business are focused on achieving deeper market penetration and cross selling our diverse product mix to meet the broad range of financial needs of our customers.  Our strategic priorities are designed to enhance value over the long term. A key priority is to build a leading banking franchise in our underpenetrated geographic markets. In addition, we are seeking to attract more of the investable assets of new and existing clients. PNC is focused on redefining the retail banking experience by transforming to a more customer-centric and sustainable model while lowering delivery costs as customer banking preferences evolve. Additionally, we continue to focus on expense management while investing in technology to bolster critical business infrastructure and streamline core processes.  Our capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic conditions and the Basel III framework and return excess capital to shareholders, in accordance with the currently effective capital plan included in our Comprehensive Capital   Analysis and Review (CCAR) submission to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). New regulatory short-term liquidity standards became effective for PNC and PNC Bank, National Association (PNC Bank) beginning January 1, 2015. For more detail, see the Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Capital Highlights portion of this Executive Summary, the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section and the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2015 Form 10-K.  Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance  PNC faces a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. The extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current economic, political and regulatory environment, merger and acquisition activity and operational challenges. Many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail in our 2015 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Report.  Our financial performance is substantially affected by a number of external factors outside of our control, including the following:      •    Domestic and global economic conditions, including the continuity, speed and stamina of the current U.S. economic expansion in general and its impact on our customers in particular;      •    The monetary policy actions and statements of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC);      •    The level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in, interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve;      •    The functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, the capital and other financial markets;      •    Changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape and in counterparty creditworthiness and performance as the financial services industry restructures in the current environment;      •    The impact of the extensive reforms enacted by the Dodd-Frank legislation and other legislative, regulatory and administrative initiatives and actions, including those outlined elsewhere in this Report, in our 2015 Form 10-K and in subsequent filings with the SEC;      •    The impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations;      •    Asset quality and the ability of customers, counterparties and issuers to perform in accordance with contractual terms;      •    Loan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit; and      •    Customer demand for non-loan products and services.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 3     In addition, our success will depend upon, among other things:      •    Execution of our strategic priorities and achieving targeted outcomes, including our ability to:      –    Build a leading banking franchise in our underpenetrated geographic markets;      –    Grow profitability through the acquisition and retention of customers and deepening relationships that meet our risk/return measures;      –    Increase revenue from fee income and provide innovative and valued products and services to our customers;      –    Bolster our critical infrastructure and streamline our core processes;      –    Utilize technology to develop and deliver products and services to our customers and protect PNC’s systems and customer information; and      –    Sustain our expense management.      •    Effectively managing capital and liquidity including:      –    Continuing to maintain and grow our deposit base as a low-cost stable funding source;      –    Prudent liquidity and capital management to meet evolving regulatory capital, capital planning, stress testing and liquidity standards; and      –    Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets.      •    Managing credit risk in our portfolio;      •    Our ability to manage and implement strategic business objectives within the changing regulatory environment;      •    The impact of legal and regulatory-related contingencies; and      •    The appropriateness of reserves needed for critical accounting estimates and related contingencies.  For additional information, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2015 Form 10-K.  Income Statement Highlights  Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $989 million, or $1.82 per diluted common share, a decrease of 5%, compared to $1.044 billion, or $1.88 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2015.      •    Net interest income increased $16 million, or 1%, to $2.1 billion.      •    Net interest margin decreased to 2.70% compared to 2.73% in second quarter 2015.      •    Noninterest income decreased $88 million, or 5%, to $1.7 billion as higher fee income was more than offset by lower other income.      •    Noninterest expense decreased $6 million to $2.4 billion reflecting PNC’s effective expense management.  For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section in this Financial Review.  Credit Quality Highlights  Overall credit quality remained relatively stable at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015, except for certain energy related loans.      •    Nonperforming assets increased $90 million, or 4%, to $2.5 billion.      •    Overall loan delinquencies of $1.5 billion decreased $179 million, or 11%.      •    Provision for credit losses increased to $127 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $46 million for the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter 2016 provision included $48 million for energy related loans in the oil, gas and coal sectors.      •    Net charge-offs of $134 million for the second quarter of 2016 increased $67 million compared to the second quarter of 2015.  For additional detail, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review of this Financial Review.  Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Capital Highlights  PNC’s balance sheet continued to be well-positioned at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 reflecting strong liquidity and capital.      •    Total loans increased $2.4 billion to $209.1 billion.      –    Total commercial lending grew $3.5 billion, or 3%.      –    Total consumer lending decreased $1.1 billion, or 2%.      •    Total deposits increased $.8 billion to $249.8 billion.      •    Investment securities increased $1.3 billion, or 2%, to $71.8 billion.      •    PNC maintained a strong liquidity position.      –    The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) at June 30, 2016 exceeded 100% for both PNC and PNC Bank, above the minimum phased-in requirement of 90% in 2016.      •    PNC maintained a strong capital position.      –    The Transitional Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remained stable at 10.6%.      –    Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to an estimated 10.2% compared to 10.0% based on the standardized approach rules.      •    PNC continued to return capital to shareholders.      –    We completed common stock repurchase programs for the five quarter period that ended in the second quarter of 2016.      –    We returned a total of $4.0 billion of capital to shareholders through repurchases of 29.9 million common shares for $2.7 billion and dividends on common shares of $1.3 billion over the five-quarter period.     4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q         –    Second quarter 2016 repurchases were 6.1 million common shares for $.5 billion and dividends on common shares were $.3 billion.      –    In June 2016, we announced share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four-quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2016.      –    PNC’s Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend on common stock to 55 cents per share, an increase of 4 cents per share, or 8 percent, effective with the August 5, 2016 dividend.

Total investment securities increased from 19% to 23% of average interest-earning assets.  The increase in average loans was driven by growth in average commercial real estate loans of $3.9 billion and average   commercial loans of $1.4 billion, principally in our Corporate & Institutional Banking segment, partially offset by a decrease in consumer loans of $3.0 billion. The decline in consumer loans was primarily attributable to lower home equity and education loans, and included runoff in the non-strategic portfolio of residential mortgage and brokered home equity loans. Loans remained stable at 67% of average interest-earning assets in both periods.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 5     Average interest-earning deposits with banks, which are primarily maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank, decreased in the comparison reflecting a shift to higher yielding investment securities and loans as well as lower borrowed funds, partially offset by an increase in deposits.  Average total deposits increased $11.4 billion, primarily due to higher average savings deposits, which reflected a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Additionally, average interest-bearing demand  deposits and average noninterest-bearing deposits increased as overall deposits grew. Average total deposits increased from 67% to 69% of average assets in the comparison.  Average borrowed funds declined due to decreases in average commercial paper, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings and federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements, partially offset by an increase in average bank notes and senior debt. The Liquidity Risk Management portion of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding our sources and uses of borrowed funds.  Various seasonal and other factors impact our period-end balances, whereas average balances are generally more indicative of underlying business trends apart from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Total assets were $361.3 billion at June 30, 2016 compared with $358.5 billion at December 31, 2015. The Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review provides information on changes in selected Consolidated Balance Sheet categories at June 30, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015.  Recent Market and Industry Developments  On June 29, 2016, the Federal Reserve announced the results of the 2016 CCAR exercise. As we previously announced, the Federal Reserve accepted the capital plan that PNC submitted in April 2016 and did not object to the capital actions included in that plan. See the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.  On July 6, 2016, the Federal Reserve granted the final one-year extension of the general conformance period available under the Volcker Rule provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act to give all banking entities until July 21, 2017, to conform their investments in, and relationships with, covered funds (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (legacy covered funds). As a result, PNC now has until at least July 21, 2017, to divest or conform its remaining investments in, and relationships with, legacy covered funds, including certain of PNC’s REIT preferred securities that, as currently structured, are considered legacy covered funds. In the second quarter of 2016, PNC recorded negative valuation adjustments of $51 million in noninterest income primarily associated with nonconforming investments under the Volcker Rule. For additional information regarding the Volcker Rule and related considerations, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2015 Form 10-K. The Federal Reserve has the ability to provide up to an additional 5-year extended conformance period for investments held in, and relationships with, covered funds that qualify as illiquid funds under the Volcker Rule and the Federal Reserve’s regulations.  In June 2016, following a period of public comments, the FDIC revised and updated its FAQs concerning brokered deposits that were originally released in 2015. Federal banking laws and regulations apply a variety of requirements or restrictions on insured depository institutions with respect to brokered deposits. For example, as explained in these FAQs, only a “well capitalized” insured depository institution may accept or retain brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval and brokered deposits are generally subject to higher outflow assumptions than other types of deposits for purposes of the LCR. We do not anticipate that these revised FAQs will have a material impact on PNC’s deposit-taking activities or LCR.     6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Business Segment Highlights  Table 3: Results Of Businesses – Summary (a)  (Unaudited)                                    Net Income     Revenue     Average Assets (b)    Six months ended June 30 – in millions   2016     2015     2016     2015     2016     2015     Retail Banking   $ 575     $ 443     $ 3,332     $ 3,161     $ 71,880     $ 73,691     Corporate & Institutional Banking     921       990       2,691       2,647       136,913       131,711     Asset Management Group     97       99       569       595       7,822       7,974     Residential Mortgage Banking     33       47       340       413       6,037       7,190     BlackRock     246       269       311       351       6,919       6,760     Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio     81       137       175       230       5,677       7,094     Total business segments     1,953       1,985       7,418       7,397       235,248       234,420     Other (c) (d)     (21 )      63       41       200       122,203       115,941     Total   $ 1,932     $ 2,048     $ 7,459     $ 7,597     $ 357,451     $ 350,361      (a) Our business information is presented based on our internal management reporting practices.

Additional detail is included in Note 14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 this Report.    CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW  Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was $989 million, or $1.82 per diluted common share, a decrease of 5%, compared with $1.044 billion, or $1.88 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of 2015. For the first six months of 2016, net income was $1.9 billion, or $3.49 per diluted common share, a decrease of 6%, compared with $2.0 billion, or $3.63 per diluted common share, for the first six months of 2015.  Net income decreased in both comparisons driven by higher provision for credit losses and a 2% decline in revenue, partially offset by a 2% decrease in noninterest expense in the year-to-date comparison. Lower revenue in both comparisons reflected a 5% decline in noninterest income, partially offset by a 1% increase in net interest income.  Net Interest Income   Table 4: Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin                            Three months endedJune 30     Six months endedJune 30    Dollars in millions   2016     2015     2016     2015     Net interest income   $ 2,068     $ 2,052     $ 4,166     $ 4,124     Net interest margin (a)     2.70 %      2.73 %      2.73 %      2.78 %     (a) See footnote (c) in Table 1: Consolidated Financial Highlights on page 1.  Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional information.  Net interest income increased $16 million, or 1%, and $42 million, or 1%, for the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2015. The increases in both comparisons were attributable to increases in loan and securities balances and higher loan yields, partially offset by lower purchase accounting accretion, higher borrowing costs and lower securities yields.  Net interest margins decreased in both comparisons mainly due to lower benefit from purchase accounting accretion, partially offset by the impact of lower balances on deposit with the Federal Reserve.  In the third quarter of 2016, we expect net interest income to be stable with the second quarter of 2016.  For full year 2016, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $175 million compared to 2015.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 7    Noninterest Income  Table 5: Noninterest Income                                            Three months ended June 30     Six months ended June 30         2016      2015     Change      2016      2015     Change    Dollars in millions       $     %         $     %     Noninterest income                                                                   Asset management   $ 377     $ 416     $ (39 )      (9 )%    $ 718     $ 792     $ (74 )      (9 )%    Consumer services     354       334       20       6 %      691       645       46       7 %    Corporate services     403       369       34       9 %      728       713       15       2 %    Residential mortgage     165       164       1       1 %      265       328       (63 )      (19 )%    Service charges on deposits     163       156       7       4 %      321       309       12       4 %    Net gains on sales of securities     4       8       (4 )      (50 )%      13       50       (37 )      (74 )%    Other     260       367       (107 )      (29 )%      557       636       (79 )      (12 )%    Total noninterest income   $ 1,726     $ 1,814     $ (88 )      (5 )%    $ 3,293     $ 3,473     $ (180 )      (5 )%     Noninterest income decreased in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons. Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 45% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to 47% for the same period in 2015. The comparable amounts for the year-to-date periods of 2016 and 2015 were 44% and 46%, respectively.  Asset management revenue decreased in both comparisons driven by lower earnings from our BlackRock equity investment and the impact of lower equity markets on both BlackRock and our asset management business segment. The decreases also included the impact from a $30 million trust settlement during the second quarter of 2015 in our asset management business segment. Discretionary client assets under management were $135 billion at June 30, 2016 compared with $134 billion at June 30, 2015.  Consumer services fees increased in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, primarily due to growth in payment-related products including debit card, credit card and merchant services, as well as increased brokerage fees.  Corporate services revenue increased in both comparisons primarily as a result of higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher loan syndication fees.  Residential mortgage revenue decreased in the year-to-date comparison as a result of lower residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, and lower loan sales revenue, partially offset by higher servicing fee revenue.  Other noninterest income decreased in both comparisons mainly attributable to second quarter valuation adjustments of $51 million primarily associated with nonconforming investments under the Volcker Rule as well as lower net gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares. Net gains on the sale of Visa Class B common shares were $63 million on sales of 1.35 million shares for the first six months of 2016, including $31 million on the sale of 0.85 million shares in the second   quarter of 2016, compared to $79 million on the sale of 1.0 million shares in the second quarter of 2015. Net gains consist of gains on Visa sales reduced by derivative fair value adjustments related to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa Class B common shares in connection with all prior sales.  In the third quarter of 2016, we expect fee income to remain stable with the second quarter of 2016. Fee income, a non-GAAP financial measure, refers to noninterest income categories of asset management, consumer services, corporate services, residential mortgage and service charges on deposits.  For full year 2016, we expect total revenue to be stable compared to 2015.  Provision For Credit Losses  The provision for credit losses increased $81 million to $127 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 and increased $179 million to $279 million for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in both comparisons was primarily due to provision for energy related loans in the oil, gas, and coal sectors, which was $128 million for the first six months of 2016, including $48 million in the second quarter of 2016. The energy related loan portfolio weakened slightly in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2016, but at a slower pace.  We expect our provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2016 to be between $100 million and $150 million.  The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.     8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Noninterest Expense  Noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2016 remained stable at $2.4 billion compared to the second quarter of 2015. Noninterest expense decreased $74 million, or 2%, to $4.6 billion for the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the release of $24 million in residential mortgage foreclosure-related reserves and lower legal accruals, and reflected our effective expense management.  As of June 30, 2016, we have completed actions to capture more than two-thirds of our 2016 continuous improvement savings goal of $400 million, and are on track to achieve the full-year goal. Through this program, we intend to help fund our continued investments in technology and business infrastructure throughout 2016.  We expect noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2016 to remain stable compared to the second quarter 2016, and full year 2016 noninterest expense to remain stable compared to full year 2015.  Effective Income Tax Rate  The effective income tax rate was 24.3% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 28.2% in the second quarter of 2015 and 23.9% in the first six months of 2016 compared to 26.4% in the same period of 2015. Both declines were primarily attributable to increased tax credit investments and a change in 2015 to record the impact of historic tax credits as a reduction to the associated investment asset balance.  The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits PNC receives from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments.  We expect our full-year 2016 effective tax rate to be approximately 25%.

PNC’s balance sheet reflected asset growth and strong liquidity and capital positions at June 30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015.      •    Total assets increased in the comparison primarily due to increases in loans, investment securities, and other assets driven by accounts receivable for trade date securities sales, partially offset by lower interest-earning deposits with banks.      •    Total liabilities increased mainly due to deposit growth and higher other liabilities driven by accounts payable for trade date securities purchases.      •    Total equity increased mainly due to increased retained earnings driven by net income, offset by share repurchases.  Loans  Outstanding loan balances of $209.1 billion at June 30, 2016 and $206.7 billion at December 31, 2015 were net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees, unamortized discounts and premiums, and purchase discounts and premiums totaling $1.4 billion at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Loans represented 58% of total assets at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Commercial lending represented 66% of the loan portfolio at June 30, 2016 and 65% at December 31, 2015. Consumer lending represented 34% of the loan portfolio at June 30, 2016 and 35% at December 31, 2015. See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our loan portfolio.  Total loans above include purchased impaired loans of $3.2 billion, or 2% of total loans, at June 30, 2016, and $3.5 billion, or 2% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. For the third quarter of 2016, we expect total loans to be up modestly compared to the second quarter of 2016.

Recorded investment may be greater than the outstanding balance due to expected recoveries of collateral.   The excess of undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the constant effective yield method. Activity for the accretable yield during the first six months of 2016 and 2015 follows:  Table 9: Purchased Impaired Loans – Accretable Yield                In millions   2016     2015     January 1   $ 1,250     $ 1,558     Accretion (including excess cash recoveries)     (199 )      (252 )    Net reclassifications to accretable from non-accretable     110       146     Disposals     (4 )      (9 )    June 30   $ 1,157     $ 1,443    We currently expect to collect total cash flows of $4.1 billion on purchased impaired loans, representing the $2.9 billion carrying value at June 30, 2016 and accretable net interest of $1.2 billion.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 11    Investment Securities  The following table presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio by credit rating. We have included credit ratings information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio.

Investment securities represented 20% of total assets at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  We evaluate our investment securities portfolio in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps to improve our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well-diversified and of high quality. At June 30, 2016, 90% of the securities in the portfolio were rated AAA/AA, with U.S. Treasury and government agencies, agency residential mortgage-backed and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities collectively representing 68% of the portfolio.  The investment securities portfolio includes both available for sale and held to maturity securities. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses, representing the difference between amortized cost and fair value, included in Shareholders’ equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. As of June 30, 2016, the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities totaled $55.6 billion and $56.9 billion, respectively, compared to an amortized cost and fair value as of December 31, 2015 of $55.3 billion and $55.8 billion, respectively. The amortized cost and fair value of held to maturity securities were $14.9 billion and $15.5 billion, respectively, at June 30, 2016, compared to $14.8 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2015.  The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. In addition, the fair   value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. Net unrealized gains in the total investment securities portfolio increased to $1.8 billion at June 30, 2016 from $0.7 billion at December 31, 2015. The comparable amounts for the securities available for sale portfolio were $1.3 billion at June 30, 2016 and $0.5 billion at December 31, 2015.  Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities do not impact liquidity; however these gains and losses do affect capital under the regulatory capital rules. Also, a change in the securities’ credit ratings could impact the liquidity of the securities and may be indicative of a change in credit quality, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules. In addition, the amount representing the credit-related portion of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) on securities would reduce our earnings and regulatory capital ratios.  The duration of investment securities was 2.0 years at June 30, 2016. We estimate that at June 30, 2016 the effective duration of investment securities was 2.1 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 1.8 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2015 for the effective duration of investment securities were 2.8 years and 2.6 years, respectively.  Based on current interest rates and expected prepayment speeds, the weighed-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding corporate stock and other) was 4.0 years at June 30, 2016 compared to 4.8 years at December 31, 2015. The weighted-average expected maturities of mortgage and other asset-backed debt securities were as follows as of June 30, 2016:     12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Table 12: Weighted-Average Expected Maturities of Mortgage and Other Asset-Backed Debt Securities           June 30, 2016   Years     Agency residential mortgage-backed securities     3.4     Non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities     5.3     Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities     2.9     Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities     3.6     Asset-backed securities     2.6    At least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on all securities. If economic conditions, including home prices, were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and liquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio would likely be adversely affected and we could incur additional OTTI credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement. For those securities on our balance sheet at June 30, 2016, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represented OTTI, we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.1 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities. The majority of these cumulative impairment charges related to non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities rated BB or lower.

Loans Held for Sale  Table 13: Loans Held For Sale                           June 30 2016      December 31  2015    Change    In millions       $     %     Commercial mortgages   $ 1,000     $668    $ 332       50 %    Residential mortgages     1,137     850      287       34 %    Other     159     22      137       623 %    Total   $ 2,296     $1,540    $ 756       49 %   Loans held for sale increased in the comparison reflecting higher origination volumes in both commercial and residential mortgages.  We sold $1.5 billion of commercial mortgage loans to agencies during the first six months of 2016 compared to $2.2 billion during the first six months of 2015. Total revenue of $33 million was recognized on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, during the first six months of 2016, including $16 million in the second quarter. Comparable amounts for 2015 were $51   million and $36 million, respectively. These amounts are included in Other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.  Residential mortgage loan origination volume was $4.5 billion during the first six months of 2016 compared to $5.5 billion in the same period in 2015. The majority of such loans were originated under agency or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) standards. We sold $2.8 billion of loans and recognized loan sales revenue of $159 million during the first six months of 2016, of which $95 million occurred in the second quarter. The comparable amounts for 2015 were $4.0 billion and $203 million, respectively, including $99 million in the second quarter. These loan sales revenue amounts are included in Residential mortgage noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.  Interest income on loans held for sale was $34 million during the first six months of 2016, including $18 million in the second quarter. Comparable amounts for 2015 were $46 million and $23 million, respectively. These amounts are included in Other interest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.

Total deposits increased in the comparison mainly due to growth in savings deposits reflecting in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Interest-bearing deposits represented 69% of total deposits at June 30, 2016 and 68% at December 31, 2015.  Total borrowed funds increased slightly in the comparison as higher bank notes and senior debt were substantially offset by maturities of FHLB borrowings.  Capital  We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.  We repurchase shares of PNC common stock under common stock repurchase authorizations approved by PNC’s Board of Directors and consistent with capital plans submitted to, and accepted by, the Federal Reserve. The extent and timing of share repurchases under authorizations will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results of future supervisory assessments of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve as part of the CCAR process.  In the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased 6.1 million common shares for $.5 billion, completing our common stock repurchase programs for the five quarter period that ended in June 2016. We returned a total of $4.0 billion of capital to shareholders through repurchases of 29.9 million common shares for $2.7 billion and dividends on common shares of $1.3 billion over the five quarter period, consistent with the capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve as part of our 2015 CCAR submission.  In connection with the 2016 CCAR process, we submitted our capital plan as approved by PNC’s Board of Directors, to the Federal Reserve in April 2016. The Federal Reserve accepted the capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions. As provided for in the 2016 capital plan, PNC announced new share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four-quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2016, including repurchases of up to $200 million related to employee benefit plans.  We paid dividends on common stock of $.3 billion, or 51 cents per common share, during the second quarter of 2016. On July 7, 2016, the PNC Board of Directors raised the quarterly common stock cash dividend to 55 cents per share, an increase of 4 cents, or 8%, payable on August 5, 2016.  See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business of our 2015 Form 10-K for further information concerning the CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans. See also the Capital section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on our 2015 CCAR submission and current capital plan.

The increase in total shareholders’ equity compared to December 31, 2015 was mainly due to a $1.3 billion increase in retained earnings and higher accumulated other comprehensive income primarily related to net securities gains, partially offset by common share repurchases of $1.0 billion. The increase in retained earnings was driven by net income of $1.9 billion, reduced by $.6 billion of common and preferred dividends declared. Common shares outstanding were 493 million and 504 million at June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.     14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table 16: Basel III Capital                   June 30, 2016    Dollars in millions    2016Transitional Basel III (a)     Pro forma FullyPhased-In Basel III(estimated) (b)(c)     Common equity Tier 1 capital               Common stock plus related surplus, net of treasury stock   $ 11,058     $ 11,058     Retained earnings     30,309       30,309     Accumulated other comprehensive income for securities currently and previously held as available for sale     499       831     Accumulated other comprehensive income for pension and other postretirement plans     (327 )      (545 )    Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities     (8,833 )      (8,833 )    Other disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities     (175 )      (291 )    Other adjustments/(deductions)     (158 )      (165 )    Total common equity Tier 1 capital before threshold deductions     32,373       32,364     Total threshold deductions     (710 )      (1,185 )    Common equity Tier 1 capital     31,663       31,179     Additional Tier 1 capital               Preferred stock plus related surplus     3,455       3,455     Trust preferred capital securities     –       –     Noncontrolling interests (d)     418       45     Other adjustments/(deductions)     (86 )      (109 )    Tier 1 capital     35,450       34,570     Additional Tier 2 capital               Qualifying subordinated debt     4,041       3,845     Trust preferred capital securities     119       –     Allowance for loan and lease losses included in Tier 2 capital     2,989       2,989     Other (d)     6       11     Total Basel III capital   $ 42,605     $ 41,415     Risk-weighted assets               Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets (e)   $ 297,724     $ 305,918     Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets (f)     N/A     $ 278,863     Average quarterly adjusted total assets   $ 348,195     $ 347,572     Supplementary leverage exposure (g)   $ 411,912     $ 411,289     Basel III risk-based capital and leverage ratios               Common equity Tier 1     10.6 %      10.2 %(h)(i)    Tier 1     11.9 %      11.3 %(h)(j)    Total     14.3 %      13.5 %(h)(k)    Leverage (l)     10.2 %      9.9 %    Supplementary leverage ratio (m)     8.6 %      8.4 %     (a) Calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during 2016.

This capital ratio is calculated using pro forma fully phased-in Common equity Tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.    (j) For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio estimate is 12.4%. This capital ratio is calculated using fully phased-in Tier 1 capital and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.    (k) For comparative purposes only, the pro forma fully phased-in advanced approaches Basel III Total capital risk-based capital ratio estimate is 13.8%. This ratio is calculated using fully phased-in Total Basel III capital, which under the advanced approaches, Additional Tier 2 capital includes allowance for loan and lease losses in excess of Basel expected credit losses, if any, up to 0.6% of credit risk related risk-weighted assets and dividing by estimated Basel III advanced approach risk-weighted assets.    (l) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.    (m) Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure. As advanced approaches banking organizations, PNC and PNC Bank will be subject to a 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio effective January 1, 2018.    As a result of the staggered effective dates of the final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules (Basel III rules), as well as the fact that PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, PNC’s regulatory risk-based ratios in 2016 are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets, and the definitions of, and deductions from, regulatory capital under the Basel III rules (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2016). We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions in effect for 2016 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as the 2016 Transitional Basel III ratios. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures, equity exposures and securitization exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures.  Under the Basel III rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a phase-in schedule and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institution’s adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel III regulatory capital includes (subject to a phase-in schedule) accumulated other comprehensive income related to securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.  Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our June 30, 2016 capital levels were aligned with them.  At June 30, 2016, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based   capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital, and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.  We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on PNC in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 19 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of this Report for details on PNC’s December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 Transitional Basel III and Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity tier 1 capital ratios.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  We engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as “off-balance sheet arrangements.” Additional information on these types of activities is included in our 2015 Form 10-K and in the following sections of this Report:      •    Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of this Financial Review,      •    Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, and      •    Note 13 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements.  PNC consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE.  A summary of VIEs, including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements, as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, is included in Note 2 of this Report.     16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Trust Preferred Securities and REIT Preferred Securities  See Note 11 Borrowed Funds and Note 16 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on trust preferred securities issued by PNC Capital Trust C and REIT preferred securities issued by PNC Preferred Funding Trust I and PNC Preferred Funding Trust II including information on contractual limitations potentially imposed on payments (including dividends) with respect to PNC and PNC Bank’s equity capital securities.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  In addition to the following, see Note 6 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further information regarding fair value.  The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the portions of such assets and liabilities that are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those where the fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs.

Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review and the Business Segments Highlights in the Executive Summary section of this Financial Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial Review of business net interest revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis.  Net interest income in business segment results reflects PNC’s internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.

(c) Represents consumer checking relationships that process the majority of their transactions through non-teller channels.

(e) Excludes satellite offices (e.g., drive-ups, electronic branches and retirement centers) that provide limited products and/or services.    (f) Included in total branches, represents branches operating under our Universal model.    (g) Amounts include cash and money market balances.    Retail Banking earned $575 million in the first six months of 2016 compared with earnings of $443 million for the first six months of 2015. The increase in earnings was driven by higher revenue, including both net interest income and noninterest income, as well as a decrease in noninterest expense. Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product offerings that drive product value for consumers and small businesses. We are focused on growing customer share of wallet through the sale of liquidity, banking, and investment products that meet the broad range of financial needs of our customers.  Retail Banking continued to focus on the strategic priority of transforming the customer experience through transaction migration, branch network transformation and multi-channel sales and service strategies.      •    In the first six months of 2016, approximately 57% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions compared with 51% for the same period in 2015.      •    Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 48% of total deposit transactions in the first six months of 2016 compared with 41% for the same period in 2015.      •    Integral to PNC’s retail branch transformation strategy, 467 branches, or 18% of the branch network, operate under the universal model designed to enhance sales opportunities for branch personnel, in part, by driving higher ATM and mobile deposits. PNC had a network of 2,601 branches and 8,993 ATMs at June 30, 2016.      •    Instant debit card issuance, which enables us to print a customer’s debit card in minutes, was available in 1,776 branches, or 68% of the branch network, as of June 30, 2016.  Net interest income increased in the comparison due to growth in deposit balances and interest rate spread on the value of deposits, partially offset by lower loan balances and interest rate spread compression on the value of loans.  Growth in noninterest income primarily resulted from execution on our share of wallet strategy, which drove increased consumer service fee income from payment-related products, specifically in debit card, credit card and merchant services, as well as increased brokerage fees. Noninterest income in the first six months of 2016 also reflected net gains of $63 million on sales of 1.35 million Visa Class B common shares compared with a net gain of $79 million on the sale of 1.0 million shares in the second quarter of 2015. Net gains on Visa sales include derivative fair value adjustments related to swap agreements with purchasers of Visa Class B common shares in connection with all prior sales.  The decline in noninterest expense in the comparison was due to lower marketing expense and reduced branch network   expenses as a result of network transformation and transaction migration to lower cost digital and ATM channels.  Provision for credit losses increased compared to the same period a year ago, reflecting slowing credit quality improvement.  The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market specific deposit growth strategies, and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC.  In the first six months of 2016, average total deposits of $152.8 billion increased compared to the same period a year ago, driven by growth in savings deposits reflecting in part a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Additionally, demand deposit categories increased, partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit, due to the net runoff of maturing accounts.  Retail Banking continued to focus on a relationship-based lending strategy that targets specific products and markets for growth. The decline in average total loans in the comparison was due to a decline in home equity and commercial loans and runoff of non-strategic portions of the portfolios, as more fully described below.      •    Average home equity loans decreased as pay-downs and payoffs on loans exceeded new originated volume, consistent with lower mortgage refinance demand. Retail Banking’s home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with over 97% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint. The weighted-average updated FICO scores for this portfolio was 752 at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.      •    Average commercial and commercial real estate loans declined as pay-downs and payoffs on loans exceeded new volume.      •    Average automobile loans, comprised of both direct and indirect auto loans, increased primarily due to portfolio growth in previously underpenetrated markets.      •    Average credit card balances increased as a result of efforts to increase credit card share of wallet through organic growth.      •    In the first six months of 2016, average loan balances for the remainder of the portfolio declined $996 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in 2015, driven by declines in the discontinued government guaranteed education, indirect other, and residential mortgage portfolios, which are primarily runoff portfolios.  Nonperforming assets decreased compared to June 30, 2015 driven by declines in both consumer and commercial nonperforming loans.

See the additional revenue discussion regarding treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities in the Product Revenue section of the Corporate & Institutional Banking portion of this Business Segments Review section.    (d) Includes amounts reported in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income.    (e) Includes other noninterest income for valuations on commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, derivative valuations, origination fees, gains on sale of loans held for sale and net interest income on loans held for sale.    (f) Includes net interest income and noninterest income (primarily in corporate services fees) from loan servicing net of reduction in commercial mortgage servicing rights due to time decay and payoffs. Commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge is shown separately.    (g) Amounts reported in corporate services revenue.    (h) Includes nonperforming loans of $.7 billion at June 30, 2016 and $.4 billion at June 30, 2015.    Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $921 million in the first six months of 2016 compared with earnings of $990 million for the first six months of 2015. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest income. We continue to focus on building client relationships where the risk-return profile is attractive, including in the Southeast.  Net interest income decreased slightly in the comparison, as continued interest rate spread compression on loans and lower purchase accounting accretion were essentially offset by the impact of higher average loans and deposits as well as interest rate spread expansion on deposits.  Higher noninterest income in the comparison was primarily due to an equity investment gain and higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, structuring fees on asset securitizations and loan syndication fees. These increases were partially offset by lower multifamily loans originated for sale to agencies and lower revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities.  Overall credit quality for the first six months of 2016 remained relatively stable, except for deterioration related to certain energy related loans, which was the primary driver for the increases in provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and nonperforming assets in the year over year comparisons. Increased provision for credit losses also reflected the impact of continued loan growth.  Noninterest expense increased nominally in the comparison reflecting disciplined expense management.  Average loans increased in the comparison due to strong growth in Real Estate, partially offset by a decline in Corporate Banking:      •    PNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Higher average loans for this business was primarily due to growth in commercial lending driven by higher term and REIT lending.      •    Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to midsized and large corporations, government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business declined in the comparison, reflecting the impact of ongoing capital and liquidity management activities, partially offset by increased lending to large corporate clients.      •    PNC Business Credit provides asset-based lending. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets. Average loans for this business increased in the comparison due to new originations.      •    PNC Equipment Finance provides equipment financing solutions for clients throughout the U.S.          and Canada. Average loans, including commercial loans and finance leases, and operating leases were $11.8 billion in the first six months of 2016, stable with the first six months of 2015.  Average deposits increased slightly compared to the prior year period, as a result of interest-bearing demand deposit growth, mostly offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing demand deposits and money market deposits.  Growth in the commercial loan servicing portfolio was driven by servicing additions from new and existing customers exceeding portfolio run-off.  Product Revenue  In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 19 in the Corporate & Institutional Banking portion of this Business Segments Review section includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.  Treasury management revenue, comprised of fees and net interest income from customer deposit balances, increased in the comparison to the prior year period, driven by liquidity-related revenue.  Capital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets advisory related services. Revenue from capital markets-related products and services increased slightly in the comparison, as higher merger and acquisition advisory fees, structuring fees on asset securitizations and loan syndication fees were mostly offset by lower revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities and lower equity capital markets advisory fees.  Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total commercial mortgage banking activities decreased in the comparison due to lower multifamily loans originated for sale to agencies, partially offset by higher mortgage servicing revenue.

(d) As a result of certain investment advisory services performed by one of our registered investment advisors, certain assets are reported as both discretionary client assets under management and nondiscretionary client assets under administration. The amount of such assets was approximately $9 billion at June 30, 2016 and $5 billion at June 30, 2015.    22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Asset Management Group earned $97 million through the first six months of 2016 compared with earnings of $99 million for the first six months of 2015. Earnings for the first six months of 2016 decreased compared with the first six months of 2015 due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense and provision for credit losses.  Total revenue declined in the comparison due to lower noninterest income reflecting a $30 million trust settlement in the second quarter of 2015 and lower average equity markets, partially offset by higher net interest income. Noninterest expense declined primarily attributable to lower personnel expense. Asset Management Group remains focused on disciplined expense management as it invests in strategic growth opportunities.  The core growth strategies of the business include increasing sales sourced from other PNC lines of business, maximizing front line productivity and optimizing market presence in high opportunity markets. Wealth Management and Hawthorn have nearly 100 offices operating in 7 of the 10 most affluent states in the U.S. with a majority co-located with retail banking branches. The strategies primarily focus on growing client assets under management through expanding relationships directly and through cross-selling from PNC’s other lines of business.  Institutional Asset Management provides advisory, custody, and retirement administration services to institutional clients primarily within our banking footprint. The business also offers PNC proprietary mutual funds. Institutional Asset Management is strengthening its partnership with Corporate & Institutional Banking to drive growth and is focused on building retirement capabilities and expanding product solutions for all customers.  Discretionary client assets under management increased in the comparison to the prior year, primarily attributable to equity market increases as of June 30, 2016 compared to the prior year and new business activities.

The strategic focus of the business is the acquisition of new customers through a retail loan officer sales force with an emphasis on home purchase transactions. Our strategy involves competing on the basis of superior service to new and existing customers in serving their home purchase and refinancing needs. A key consideration in pursuing this approach is the cross-sell opportunity, especially in the bank footprint markets.  Residential Mortgage Banking overview:      •    Total loan originations decreased $1 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Loans continue to be originated primarily through direct channels under Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA)/Department of Veterans Affairs agency guidelines.      •    Lower net interest income was primarily due to lower originations and lower balances of portfolio loans held for investment.      •    Noninterest income declined in the comparison as increased servicing fee income was more than offset by lower residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, and decreased loan sales revenue.      •    Noninterest expense declined primarily as a result of lower residential mortgage foreclosure-related expenses, including reserve releases of $24 million, as well as lower legal accruals and servicing costs.

(d) Recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to acquisitions. This segment contained 81% of PNC’s purchased impaired loans at June 30, 2016 and 82% at June 30, 2015.  This business segment consists of non-strategic assets primarily obtained through acquisitions of other companies. The business activity of this segment is to manage the liquidation of the portfolios while maximizing the value and mitigating risk.  Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio had earnings of $81 million in the first six months of 2016 compared with $137 million in the first six months of 2015. Earnings decreased primarily due to a declining loan portfolio and a provision for credit losses in the current period compared to a benefit in the prior year period.    26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio overview:      •    Lower net interest income resulted from lower purchase accounting accretion and the impact of the declining average balance of the loan portfolio.      •    Noninterest income increased in the comparison, driven by a release of excess reserves for estimated losses on repurchase obligations in the first quarter 2016 related to a settlement.      •    The change in provision for credit losses (benefit) was driven by higher commercial recoveries and a release of reserves in 2015.      •    Noninterest expense declined due to lower costs of managing and servicing the loan portfolios as the portfolio balance continues to decline.      •    Average portfolio loans declined in the comparison due to customer payment activity and portfolio management activities to reduce under-performing assets. The decrease also reflects the impact of our change in derecognition policy effective December 31, 2015 for certain purchase impaired loans.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  Note 1 Accounting Policies in Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K and in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report describe the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.  The following critical accounting policies and judgments are described in more detail in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in Item 7 of our 2015 Form 10-K:      •    Fair Value Measurements      •    Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit      •    Estimated Cash Flows on Purchased Impaired Loans      •    Goodwill      •    Lease Residuals      •    Revenue Recognition      •    Residential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights      •    Income Taxes  We provide additional information about many of these items in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item l of this Report.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  Revenue Recognition  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic   606). This ASU clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP with one accounting model. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the satisfaction of a performance obligation by transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  In August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the mandatory effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year, to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. During 2016, the FASB has also issued three separate ASUs which amend the original standard to clarify guidance regarding principal versus agent considerations, identifying performance obligations and licensing, and certain narrow-scope amendments which address the presentation of sales tax, noncash consideration, contract modifications at transition and assessing collectability.  The requirements within ASU 2014-09 and its subsequent amendments should be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (with several practical expedients for certain completed contracts) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of initial application. We plan to adopt the ASU consistent with the deferred mandatory effective date. Based on our evaluation to date, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position.  Financial Instruments  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU changes the accounting for certain equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. Equity investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value with any changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments for which fair value is not readily determinable. Additionally, the ASU changes the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value; and amends certain disclosure requirements relating to the fair value of financial instruments. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet, except for the amendment related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied prospectively. We plan to adopt all provisions consistent with the effective date and are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our results of operations and financial position.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 27     Leases  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The primary change in the new guidance is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for operating leases. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.  Credit Losses  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The ASU requires the use of an expected credit loss methodology; specifically, expected credit losses for the remaining life of the asset will be recognized at the time of origination or acquisition. The expected credit loss methodology will apply to loans, debt securities, and other financial assets and net investment in leases not accounted for at fair value through net income. It will also apply to off-balance sheet credit exposures except for unconditionally cancellable commitments. Assets in the scope of the ASU, except for purchased credit deteriorated assets, will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the assets.  Enhanced credit quality disclosures will be required including disaggregation of credit quality indicators by vintage. The development of an expected credit loss methodology and new disclosures will require significant data collection, loss model upgrades, and process re-development prior to adoption. The ASU is effective for public business entities that are SEC filers for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this Report regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements adopted in 2016.  RECOURSE AND REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated   Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K, PNC has sold commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loans/lines of credit directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets. For additional discussion regarding our recourse and repurchase obligations, see the Recourse and Repurchase Obligations section in Item 7 of our 2015 Form 10-K.  RISK MANAGEMENT  The Risk Management section included in Item 7 of our 2015 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk management framework including risk appetite and strategy, risk culture, risk organization and governance, risk identification and quantification, risk control and limits, and risk monitoring and reporting. Additionally, our 2015 Form 10-K provides an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, operational, compliance, model, liquidity and market. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section.  The following information updates our 2015 Form 10-K risk management disclosures.  Credit Risk Management  See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding credit risk.  Asset Quality Overview  Asset quality trends remained relatively stable during the first six months of 2016, except for certain energy related loans.      •    Provision for credit losses for the second quarter of 2016 increased to $127 million compared to $46 million for the second quarter of 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, provision for credit losses increased to $279 million compared with $100 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. During the first six months of 2016, provision included $128 million related to energy loans in the oil, gas, and coal sectors, of which $48 million was included in the second quarter.      •    Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2016 increased $90 million compared with December 31, 2015 due to higher nonperforming commercial loans driven by energy related loans, partially offset by declining home equity and residential real estate nonperforming loans, and lower OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming assets were 0.70% of total assets at June 30, 2016 compared with 0.68% at December 31, 2015.     28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q         •    Overall loan delinquencies totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2016, a decrease of $179 million, or 11%, from year-end 2015. The reduction was due in large part to a decrease in accruing government insured consumer lending past due loans of $129 million.      •    Net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2016 increased to $134 million compared to $67 million for the second quarter of 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, net charge-offs increased to $283 million compared with $170 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Increases were driven by higher commercial loan net charge-offs.      •    The level of ALLL remained at $2.7 billion at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies  Nonperforming Assets, including OREO and Foreclosed Assets  Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2015 Form 10-K. A summary of the major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in Table 24. See Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further detail of nonperforming asset categories.

(b) Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans.    (c) The recorded investment of loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure was $.4 billion and $.6 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Both periods included $.3 billion of loans that are government insured/guaranteed.

As of June 30, 2016, commercial lending   nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 66% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the ALLL. See Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on these loans.  Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 71% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at June 30, 2016, up from 68% at December 31, 2015. Home equity TDRs comprise 52% of home equity nonperforming loans at June 30, 2016, up from 51% at December 31, 2015. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29     through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.  At June 30, 2016, our largest nonperforming asset was $41 million in the Real Estate, Rental and Leasing Industry and our average nonperforming loan associated with commercial lending was less than $1 million. The ten largest outstanding nonperforming assets are from the commercial lending portfolio and represent 41% and 13% of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of June 30, 2016.

As of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 59% of our OREO and foreclosed assets were comprised of residential related properties.  Loan Delinquencies  We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.

Total early stage loan delinquencies (accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days) decreased at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 due primarily to reductions in consumer early stage delinquencies.  Accruing loans past due 90 days or more decreased at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 driven by declines in government insured consumer lending loans. These loans are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, or are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed loans.  On a regular basis our Special Asset Committee closely monitors loans, primarily commercial loans, that are not included in the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrower’s ability to comply with existing repayment terms. These loans totaled $.2 billion and $.1 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information regarding our nonperforming loan and nonaccrual policies and further information on loan delinquencies.    30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Home Equity Loan Portfolio  Our home equity loan portfolio totaled $30.9 billion as of June 30, 2016, or 15% of the total loan portfolio. Of that total, $18.2 billion, or 59%, were outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $12.7 billion, or 41%, consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans. Approximately 4% of the home equity portfolio was purchased impaired and 3% of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of June 30, 2016.  As of June 30, 2016, we were in an originated first lien position for approximately 54% of the total outstanding portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we held or serviced the first lien position for an additional 2% of the portfolio. The remaining 44% of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position. The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position, is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien.  Generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20-year amortization term. During the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest. We view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. The risk associated with the borrower’s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our ALLL. Based upon outstanding balances at June 30, 2016, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end.  Table 28: Home Equity Lines of Credit – Draw Period End Dates             In millions   Interest OnlyProduct     Principal andInterest Product   Remainder of 2016   $ 476     $ 156   2017     1,927     500   2018     863     689   2019     601     531   2020     480     478   2021 and thereafter     2,876     5,767   Total (a) (b)   $ 7,223     $8,121    (a) Includes all home equity lines of credit that mature in the remainder 2016 or later, including those with borrowers where we have terminated borrowing privileges.    (b) Includes home equity lines of credit with balloon payments, including those where we have terminated borrowing privileges of $18 million, $42 million, $31 million, $23 million, $75 million and $436 million with draw periods scheduled to end in the remainder of 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and thereafter, respectively.  Based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at June 30, 2016, for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw (e.g., draw   period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 3% were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5% were 90 days or more past due, which are accounted for as nonperforming. Generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. At that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a TDR.  See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information on our home equity loan portfolio. See also Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Auto Loan Portfolio  The auto loan portfolio totaled $11.4 billion as of June 30, 2016, or 5% of our total loan portfolio. Of that total, $9.9 billion resides in the indirect auto portfolio, $1.1 billion in the direct auto portfolio, and $.4 billion in acquired or securitized portfolios, which has been declining as no pools have been recently acquired. The indirect auto portfolio is the largest segment and generates auto loan applications from franchised automobile dealers. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail business.  We have elected not to pursue non-prime auto lending as evidenced by an average new loan origination FICO score over the last twelve months of 759 for indirect auto loans and 773 for direct auto loans. As of June 30, 2016, 0.3% of the portfolio was nonperforming and 0.4% of our auto loan portfolio was accruing past due. We offer both new and used automobile financing to customers through our various channels. The portfolio comprised 59% new vehicle loans and 41% used vehicle loans at June 30, 2016.  The auto loan portfolio’s performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type, and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by loan structure, collateral attributes, and credit metrics which include FICO score, loan-to-value and term.  Energy Related Loan Portfolio  Our portfolio of loans outstanding in the oil and gas industry totaled $2.7 billion as of June 30, 2016, or 1% of our total loan portfolio and 2% of our total commercial lending portfolio. This portfolio comprised approximately $1.1 billion in the midstream and downstream sectors, $.9 billion to oil services companies and $.7 billion to upstream sectors. Of the oil services portfolio, approximately $.2 billion is not asset-based or investment grade. Nonperforming loans in the oil and gas sector as of June 30, 2016 totaled $187 million, or 7% of total nonperforming assets.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 31     Our portfolio of loans outstanding in the coal industry totaled $.5 billion as of June 30, 2016, or less than 1% of both our total loan portfolio and our total commercial lending portfolio. Nonperforming loans in the coal industry as of June 30, 2016 totaled $106 million, or 4% of total nonperforming assets.  Our ALLL at June 30, 2016 included the impact of our lending exposure to energy companies. Higher reserves for oil, gas and coal exposure drove the overall increase in the provision for credit losses. For the first six months of 2016, $128 million, or 46%, of the provision was related to these sectors. For the second quarter of 2016, these amounts were $48 million and 38%, respectively. Net charge-offs related to energy loans totaled $72 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, or 25% of total net-charge-offs. For the second quarter of 2016, these amounts were $47 million and 35%, respectively.  Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings  Consumer Loan Modifications  We modify loans under government and PNC-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. Loans that are either temporarily or permanently modified under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as TDRs. Further, loans that have certain types of payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs. Additional detail on TDRs is discussed below as well as in Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2015 Form 10-K.  A temporary modification, with a term between 3 and 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. Permanent modification programs, including both government-created Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and PNC-developed modification programs, generally result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, capitalization of past due amounts, interest only period or deferral of principal.  We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our borrowers’ and servicing customers’ needs while mitigating credit losses. Table 29 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans at the end of each year presented.  Table 29: Consumer Real Estate Related Loan Modifications                      June 30, 2016   December 31, 2015  Dollars in millions   Number ofAccounts     UnpaidPrincipalBalance   Number ofAccounts   UnpaidPrincipalBalance   Temporary modifications (a)     3,893     $ 293   4,469   $ 337   Permanent modifications                  Home equity     15,467     1,104   15,268   1,088   Residential real estate     8,398     1,626   8,787   1,721   Total permanent modifications     23,865     2,730   24,055   2,809   Total consumer real estate related loan modifications     27,758     $3,023   28,524   $3,146    (a) All temporary modifications are home equity loans.  In addition to temporary loan modifications, we may make a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period available to a borrower. Under a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period, there is no change to the loan’s contractual terms so the borrower remains legally responsible for payment of the loan under its original terms.  Payment plans may include extensions, re-ages and/or forbearance plans. All payment plans bring an account current once certain requirements are achieved and are primarily intended to demonstrate a borrower’s renewed willingness and ability to re-pay. Due to the short term nature of the payment plan, there is a minimal impact to the ALLL.  Under a HAMP trial payment period, we establish an alternate payment, generally at an amount less than the contractual payment amount, for the borrower during this short time period. This allows a borrower to demonstrate successful payment performance before permanently restructuring the loan into a HAMP modification. Subsequent to successful borrower performance under the trial payment period, we will capitalize the original contractual amount past due, to include accrued interest and fees receivable, and restructure the loan’s contractual terms, along with bringing the restructured account current. As the borrower is often already delinquent at the time of participation in the HAMP trial payment period, generally enrollment in the program does not significantly increase the ALLL. If the trial payment period is unsuccessful, the loan will be evaluated for further action based upon our existing policies. After December 31, 2016, the government-created HAMP program will expire. As such, no new modifications will be offered under the program after that date.  Commercial Loan Modifications and Payment Plans  Modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal.     32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Additional detail on TDRs is discussed below as well as in Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2015 Form 10-K.  We have established certain commercial loan modification and payment programs for small business loans, Small Business Administration loans, and investment real estate loans. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the loan balances covered under these modification and payment plan programs, including those determined to be TDRs, were not significant.  Troubled Debt Restructurings  A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral.   Additionally, TDRs also result from court imposed concessions (e.g. a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that is discharged from personal liability to PNC and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan).  TDRs totaled $2.4 billion at June 30, 2016, an increase of $97 million, or 4%, during the first six months of 2016. Excluded from TDRs are $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of consumer loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain government insured or guaranteed loans at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Nonperforming TDRs represent approximately 55% and 53% of total nonperforming loans, and 51% and 48% of total TDRs at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual accounting after performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 3 Asset Quality in Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information on loan modifications and TDRs.

Total net charge-offs exclude write-offs and recoveries related to purchased impaired loans.  We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. Our total ALLL of $2.7 billion at June 30, 2016 consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33      lending categories, respectively. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.  We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.  Reserves allocated to non-impaired commercial loan classes are based on probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) credit risk ratings.  Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our PDs and LGDs as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment.  The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which generally demonstrate lower LGD compared to loans not secured by collateral. Additionally, guarantees on loans greater than $1 million and owner guarantees for small business loans do not significantly impact our ALLL.  Allocations to non-impaired consumer loan classes are primarily based upon a roll-rate model which uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off.  A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative and measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:      •    Industry concentrations and conditions,      •    Recent credit quality trends,      •    Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,      •    Recent macro-economic factors,      •    Model imprecision,      •    Changes in lending policies and procedures,      •    Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and      •    Limitations of available historical data.  Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. At June 30, 2016, we had reserves of $.3 billion for purchased impaired loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition.  In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL. We have allocated approximately $1.6 billion, or 60%, of the ALLL at June 30, 2016 to the commercial lending category. Consumer lending allocations are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for recent activity. Approximately $1.1 billion, or 40%, of the ALLL at June 30, 2016 has been allocated to these consumer lending categories.  In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our ALLL.  We refer you to Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish the allowances.     34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Table 31: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses               Dollars in millions   2016     2015     January 1   $ 2,727     $ 3,331     Total net charge-offs     (283 )      (170 )    Provision for credit losses     279       100     Net change in allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit     (42 )      13     Net recoveries of purchased impaired loans     4           Other             (2 )    June 30   $ 2,685     $ 3,272     Net charge-offs to average loans (for the six months ended) (annualized)     .27 %      .17 %    Total allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans (a)     1.28 %      1.59 %    Commercial lending (net charge-offs) / recoveries   $ (99 )    $ 26     Consumer lending net charge-offs     (184 )      (196 )    Total net charge-offs   $ (283 )    $ (170 )    Net charge-offs / (recoveries) to average loans (for the six months ended) (annualized)              Commercial lending     .15 %      (.04 )%    Consumer lending     .51 %      .53 %     (a) See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our change in derecognition policy effective December 31, 2015 for certain purchased impaired loans.  The provision for credit losses increased to $279 million for the first six months of 2016 compared to $100 million for the first six months of 2015, primarily driven by reserves for energy related exposure. For the first six months of 2016, the provision for commercial lending credit losses increased by $133 million from the first six months of 2015. The provision for consumer lending credit losses increased $46 million from the first six months of 2015.  At June 30, 2016, total ALLL to total nonperforming loans was 119%. The comparable amount for December 31, 2015 was 128%. These ratios are 90% and 98%, respectively, when excluding the $.6 billion of ALLL at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. We have excluded consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by real estate as they are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and not placed on nonperforming status. Additionally, we have excluded purchased impaired loans as they are considered performing regardless of their delinquency status as interest is accreted in accordance with ASC 310-30 based on the recorded investment balance. See Table 24 within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information.  The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. During the first six months of 2016, overall credit   quality remained relatively stable offsetting impacts from certain energy related loans, which resulted in an essentially flat ALLL balance as of June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 4 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on the ALLL and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.  Liquidity Risk Management  Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity Risk Management section of our 2015 Form 10-K.  One of the ways PNC monitors its liquidity is by reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by dividing the amount of an institution’s high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA), as defined and calculated in accordance with the LCR rules, by its estimated net cash outflows, with net cash outflows determined by applying the assumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The resulting quotient is expressed as a percentage. For PNC and PNC Bank, the LCR became effective January 1, 2015. The minimum required LCR will be phased-in over a period of years. The minimum LCR that PNC and PNC Bank were required to maintain was 80% in 2015 and such minimum increased to 90% in 2016. Between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2016, PNC and PNC Bank were required to calculate the LCR on a month-end basis. Effective July 1, 2016, PNC and PNC Bank began calculating the LCR on a daily basis.  As of June 30, 2016, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded 100 percent.  We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on PNC in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2015 Form 10-K.  Bank Level Liquidity – Uses  At the bank level, primary contractual obligations include funding loan commitments, satisfying deposit withdrawal requests and maturities and debt service related to bank borrowings. As of June 30, 2016, there were approximately $10.7 billion of bank borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year, including $2.3 billion in borrowings from an affiliate. We also maintain adequate bank liquidity to meet future potential loan demand and provide for other business needs, as necessary.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 35     Bank Level Liquidity – Sources  Our largest source of bank liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base generated by our retail and commercial banking businesses. Total deposits increased to $249.8 billion at June 30, 2016 from $249.0 billion at December 31, 2015, driven by growth in savings deposits, partially offset by a decline in money market deposits and time deposits in foreign offices and other time deposits. Assets determined by PNC to be liquid (liquid assets) and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. Borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short-term and long-term funding sources.  At June 30, 2016, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $30.2 billion and securities available for sale totaling $56.9 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Of our total liquid assets of $87.1 billion, we had $4.3 billion of securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition to the liquid assets we pledged, $5.4 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.  In addition to the customer deposit base, which has historically provided the single largest source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, the bank also obtains liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB advances) and short-term borrowings (Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings).  Under PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, dated January 16, 2014 and amended May 22, 2015, PNC Bank may from time to time offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. On May 27, 2016, PNC Bank increased the capacity of this program by $10.0 billion to a maximum aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of $40.0 billion. The $40.0 billion of notes authorized to be issued and outstanding at any one time includes notes issued by PNC Bank under the 2004 bank note program and those notes PNC Bank has assumed through the acquisition of other banks, in each case for so long as such notes remain outstanding. The terms of the 2014 bank note program, as amended, do not affect any of the bank notes issued prior to January 16, 2014. At June 30, 2016, PNC Bank had $25.9 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $19.7 billion was senior bank notes and $6.2 billion was subordinated bank notes. The following table details all issuances during 2016:  Table 32: PNC Bank Notes Issued During 2016            Issuance Date   Amount   Description of Issuance   March 4, 2016   $1.0 billion   Senior notes with a maturity date of March 4, 2019. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 1.950% on March 4 and September 4 of each year, beginning September 4, 2016.   April 29, 2016   $600 million   Senior notes with a maturity date of June 1, 2025. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.250% on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning June 1, 2016.   April 29, 2016   $1.25 billion   Senior notes with a maturity date of April 29, 2021. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 2.150% on April 29 and October 29 of each year, beginning October 29, 2016.  Total senior and subordinated debt of PNC Bank increased to $27.9 billion at June 30, 2016 from $25.5 billion at December 31, 2015 due to the following activity in the period. Table 33: PNC Bank Senior and Subordinated Debt            In billions   2016     January 1   $ 25.5     Issuances     2.9     Calls and maturities     (1.0 )    Other     .5     June 30   $ 27.9    See Note 15 Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for information on the issuance of senior notes by PNC Bank on July 29, 2016.  PNC Bank is a member of the FHLB-Pittsburgh and, as such, has access to advances from FHLB-Pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage loans, other mortgage-related loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities. At June 30, 2016, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $25.0 billion with the FHLB-Pittsburgh. Total FHLB borrowings decreased to $18.1 billion at June 30, 2016 from $20.1 billion at December 31, 2015 due to the following activity in the period.     36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Table 34: FHLB Borrowings            In billions   2016     January 1   $ 20.1     Issuances     3.0     Calls and maturities     (5.0 )    June 30   $ 18.1    The FHLB-Pittsburgh also periodically provides standby letters of credit on behalf of PNC Bank to secure certain public deposits. PNC Bank began using standby letters of credit issued by the FHLB-Pittsburgh for these purposes in response to the regulatory liquidity standards finalized during 2014. If the FHLB-Pittsburgh is required to make payment for a beneficiary’s draw, the payment amount is converted into a collateralized advance to PNC Bank. At June 30, 2016, standby letters of credit issued on our behalf by the FHLB-Pittsburgh totaled $4.9 billion.  PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of June 30, 2016, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.  PNC Bank can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. These potential borrowings are secured by commercial loans. At June 30, 2016, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $16.1 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank.  Parent Company Liquidity  As of June 30, 2016, available parent company liquidity totaled $4.8 billion. Parent company liquidity is primarily held in intercompany short-term investments, the terms of which provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.  Parent Company Liquidity – Uses  The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. As of June 30, 2016, there were approximately $1.9 billion of parent company borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year. Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to PNC shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions.  See Note 15 Subsequent Events in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for information on the redemption notice issued on July 18, 2016 with respect to Senior Notes issued by PNC Funding Corp.  See the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review for information on our 2016 capital plan that was accepted by the Federal Reserve. Our capital plan included a recommendation to increase the quarterly common stock dividend in the third quarter of 2016 and also included share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four-quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2016. More information on our share repurchase programs, including detail on our second quarter repurchase of 6.1 million common shares for $.5 billion, is included in the Capital portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review in this Financial Review.  On July 7, 2016, consistent with our 2016 capital plan, our Board of Directors approved an increase to PNC’s quarterly common stock dividend from 51 cents per common share to 55 cents per common share beginning with the August 5, 2016 dividend payment.  See the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in evaluating capital plans, qualitative and quantitative liquidity risk management standards proposed by the U.S. banking agencies, and final rules issued by the Federal Reserve that make certain modifications to the Federal Reserve’s capital planning and stress testing rules.  Parent Company Liquidity – Sources  The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from its subsidiary bank, which may be impacted by the following:      •    Bank-level capital needs,      •    Laws and regulations,      •    Corporate policies,      •    Contractual restrictions, and      •    Other factors.  There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $1.3 billion at June 30, 2016. See Note 19 Regulatory Matters in our 2015 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these limitations. We provide additional information on certain contractual restrictions in Note 16 Equity in our 2015 Form 10-K.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 37     In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments.  We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper.  Total parent company senior and subordinated debt and hybrid capital instruments increased to $7.7 billion at June 30, 2016 from $7.5 billion at December 31, 2015 due to the following activity in the period.  Table 35: Parent Company Senior and Subordinated Debt and Hybrid Capital Instruments            In billions   2016     January 1   $ 7.5     Other     .2     June 30   $ 7.7    The parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of June 30, 2016, there were no issuances outstanding under this program. Status of Credit Ratings  The cost and availability of short-term and long-term funding, as well as collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments, is influenced by PNC’s credit ratings. See the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information on credit ratings.  Table 36: Credit Ratings as of June 30, 2016 for PNC and PNC Bank                     Moody’s      Standard & Poor’s   Fitch   PNC               Senior debt     A3     A-   A+   Subordinated debt     A3     BBB+   A   Preferred stock     Baa2     BBB-   BBB-         PNC Bank               Senior debt     A2     A   A+   Subordinated debt     A3     A-   A   Long-term deposits     Aa2     A   AA-   Short-term deposits     P-1     A-1   F1+   Short-term notes     P-1     A-1   F1   Contractual Obligations and Commitments  We have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and postretirement benefits, and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on our commitments in Note 13 Commitments and Guarantees in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Market Risk Management   Market risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others:      •    Traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,      •    Equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and      •    Fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and securities underwriting.  We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines, and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board.  Market Risk Management – Interest Rate Risk  Interest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.  Asset and Liability Management centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.     38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015 follow: Table 37: Interest Sensitivity Analysis                     SecondQuarter2016     SecondQuarter2015     Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation (a)              Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over the following 12 months of:              100 basis point increase     3.1 %      1.7 %    100 basis point decrease     (3.2 )%      (.5 )%    Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the preceding 12 months of:              100 basis point increase     8.1 %      5.7 %    100 basis point decrease     (8.5 )%      (4.6 )%    Duration of Equity Model (a)              Base case duration of equity (in years)     (8.5 )      (3.5 )    Key Period-End Interest Rates              One-month LIBOR     .47 %      .19 %    Three-year swap     .81 %      1.25 %     (a) Given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.  In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 38 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) Yield Curve Slope Flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between 1-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.  Table 38: Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Alternative Rate Scenarios (Second Quarter 2016)                     PNCEconomist     MarketForward   SlopeFlattening   First year sensitivity     2.9 %    .7%   (2.0)%   Second year sensitivity     9.8 %    1.8%   (7.0)%  All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.  When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 37 and 38 above.   These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates. We also consider forward projections of purchase accounting accretion when forecasting net interest income.  The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.  Table 39: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward      The second quarter 2016 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions.  Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk  We engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.  We use value-at-risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for the first six months of 2016 and 2015 were within our acceptable limits.  See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2015 Form 10-K for more information on the models and backtesting.  Customer-related trading revenue decreased to $89 million for the first six months of 2016 compared with $102 million for the first six months of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to market interest rate changes impacting credit valuations for customer-related derivatives.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 39     Customer-related trading revenue decreased to $50 million for the second quarter of 2016 compared with $53 million for the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to market interest rate changes impacting credit valuations for customer-related derivatives, partially offset by higher derivative client sales and improved client-related trading results.  Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk  Equity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, and underwriting and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations, and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity and in debt and equity-oriented hedge funds. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets such as loan servicing rights are directly affected by changes in market factors.  The primary risk measurement for equity and other investments is economic capital. Economic capital is a common measure of risk for credit, market and operational risk. It is an estimate of the potential value depreciation over a one year horizon commensurate with solvency expectations of an institution rated single-A by the credit rating agencies. Given the illiquid nature of many of these types of investments, it can be a challenge to determine their fair values. See Note 6 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report and Note 7 Fair Value in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.  Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.  A summary of our equity investments follows:  Table 40: Equity Investments Summary                             June 30 2016      December 31 2015     Change    In millions       $     %     BlackRock   $ 6,710     $ 6,626     $ 84       1 %    Tax credit investments     2,093       2,254       (161 )      (7 )%    Private equity     1,398       1,441       (43 )      (3 )%    Visa     2       31       (29 )      (94 )%    Other     266       235       31       13 %    Total   $ 10,469     $ 10,587     $ (118 )      (1 )%   BlackRock   PNC owned approximately 35 million common stock equivalent shares of BlackRock equity at June 30, 2016,   accounted for under the equity method. The primary risk measurement, similar to other equity investments, is economic capital. The Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review includes additional information about BlackRock.  Tax Credit Investments   Included in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated partnerships. These equity investment balances include unfunded commitments totaling $671 million and $669 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other Liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K has further information on Tax Credit Investments.  Private Equity   The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio comprised of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment and are carried at estimated fair value. As of June 30, 2016, $1.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.3 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. Included in direct investments are investment activities of two private equity funds that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The interests held in indirect private equity funds are not redeemable, but PNC may receive distributions over the life of the partnership from liquidation of the underlying investments. See Item 1 Business – Supervision and Regulation and Item 1A Risk Factors included in our 2015 Form 10-K and the Recent Market and Industry Developments portion of the Executive Summary section of this Financial Review for discussions of the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank on our interests in and sponsorship of private funds covered by the Volcker Rule.  Our unfunded commitments related to private equity totaled $131 million at June 30, 2016 compared with $126 million at December 31, 2015.  Visa  Our 2015 Form 10-K includes information regarding the October 2007 Visa restructuring, our involvement with judgment and loss sharing agreements with Visa and certain other banks, the status of pending interchange litigation, the sales of portions of our Visa Class B common shares and the related swap agreements with the purchaser. See Note 12 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for more detail on the status of the pending interchange litigation.  During the first six months of 2016, we sold 1.35 million Visa Class B common shares, in addition to the 18.5 million shares     40 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      sold in previous years. We have entered into swap agreements with the purchasers of the shares as part of these sales. At June 30, 2016, our investment in Visa Class B common shares totaled approximately 3.5 million shares. Based on the June 30, 2016 closing price of $74.17 for the Visa Class A common shares, the fair value of our total investment was approximately $430 million at the current conversion rate. The Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the final resolution of all of the specified litigation. Other Investments   We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. The economic values could be driven by either the fixed-income market or the equity markets, or both. Given the   nature of these investments, if market conditions affecting their valuation were to worsen, we could incur future losses. Net gains related to these investments were not significant for the first six months of 2016 and 2015.  Our unfunded commitments related to other investments at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not significant.  Financial Derivatives   Information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 7 Fair Value in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K and in Note 6 Fair Value and Note 9 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, which is incorporated here by reference.  Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.     The following table summarizes the notional or contractual amounts and net fair value of financial derivatives at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  As of June 30, 2016, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.  Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief   Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of June 30, 2016, and that there has been no change in PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the second quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We do not assume any duty and do not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance.  Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.    •    Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:      –    Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets.      –    Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets.      –    The impact on financial markets and the economy of any changes in the credit ratings of U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government-backed debt, as well as issues surrounding the levels of U.S. and European government debt and concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain sovereign governments, supranationals and financial institutions in Europe.      –    Actions by the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.      –    Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness.      –    Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic expansion.      –    Continued residual effects of recessionary conditions and uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties, including adverse impacts on levels of unemployment, loan utilization rates, delinquencies, defaults and counterparty ability to meet credit and other obligations.      –    Commodity price volatility.      –    Changes in customer preferences and behavior, whether due to changing business and economic conditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors.    •    Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting. These statements are based on our current view that the U.S. economy will grow moderately in the latter half of 2016, boosted by stable oil/energy prices, improving housing activity and moderate job gains, and that lower short-term interest rates and bond yields in the aftermath of Brexit will hold fairly steady before gradually rising late this year. These forward-looking statements also do not, unless otherwise indicated, take into account the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies.    •    PNC’s ability to take certain capital actions, including paying dividends and any plans to increase common stock dividends, repurchase common stock under current or future programs, or issue or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, is subject to the review of such proposed actions by the Federal Reserve as part of PNC’s comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the Federal Reserve.    •    PNC’s regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee), the international body responsible for developing global regulatory standards for banking organizations for consideration and adoption by national jurisdictions), and management actions affecting the composition of PNC’s balance sheet. In addition, PNC’s ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.    •    Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:     42 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q         –    Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry and changes to laws and regulations involving tax, pension, bankruptcy, consumer protection, and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles. We will be impacted by extensive reforms provided for in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and otherwise growing out of the most recent financial crisis, the precise nature, extent and timing of which, and their impact on us, remains uncertain.      –    Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards, including due to the Dodd-Frank Act and initiatives of the Basel Committee.      –    Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. In addition to matters relating to PNC’s current and historical business and activities, such matters may include proceedings, claims, investigations, or inquiries relating to pre-acquisition business and activities of acquired companies, such as National City. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to PNC.      –    Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.      –    Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.    •    Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards. In particular, our results currently depend on our ability to manage elevated levels of impaired assets.    •    Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings.    •    We grow our business in part by acquiring from time to time other financial services companies, financial services assets and related deposits and other liabilities. Acquisition risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.    •    Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Industry restructuring in the current environment could also impact our business and financial performance through changes in counterparty creditworthiness and performance and in the competitive and regulatory landscape. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.    •    Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.  We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2015 Form 10-K, our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q and elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments and Guarantees Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in those reports. Our forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those discussed elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC.

BUSINESS  The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  We have businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management and residential mortgage banking, providing many of our products and services nationally, as well as other products and services in our primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Virginia, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin and South Carolina. We also provide certain products and services internationally.  NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of Financial Statement Presentation  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned, certain partnership interests, and variable interest entities.  We prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the 2016 presentation, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, we evaluate the materiality of identified errors in the financial statements using both an income statement and a balance sheet approach, based on relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The consolidated financial statements include certain adjustments to correct immaterial errors related to previously reported periods.  In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments needed to present fairly our results for the interim periods. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period.  We have also considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements.  When preparing these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, we have assumed that you have read the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note 1 Accounting Policies in the 2015 Form 10-K for a detailed description of significant accounting policies. There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies as disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These interim consolidated financial statements serve to update the 2015 Form 10-K and may not include all information and notes necessary to constitute a complete set of financial statements.  Use of Estimates  We prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Our most significant estimates pertain to our fair value measurements, allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, and accretion on purchased impaired loans. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  We did not adopt new accounting standards that had a significant impact during the second quarter of 2016.  NOTE 2 LOAN SALE AND SERVICING ACTIVITIES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  Loan Sale and Servicing Activities  As more fully described in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2015 Form 10-K, we have transferred residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have continuing involvement. Our continuing involvement generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans under certain conditions and loss share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization special purpose entities (SPEs).  We earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of loan transfer where PNC retains the servicing, we recognize a servicing right at fair value. See Note 7 Goodwill and Intangible Assets for information on our servicing rights, including the carrying value of servicing assets.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 49    The following table provides cash flows associated with PNC’s loan sale and servicing activities:  Table 42: Cash Flows Associated with Loan Sale and Servicing Activities                    In millions   ResidentialMortgages     CommercialMortgages (a)     Home EquityLoans/Lines (b)     CASH FLOWS – Three months ended June 30, 2016                    Sales of loans (c)   $ 1,408     $ 804           Repurchases of previously transferred loans (d)   $ 103                 Servicing fees (e)   $ 93     $ 32     $ 3     Servicing advances recovered/(funded), net   $ 48     $ (24 )    $ (4 )    Cash flows on mortgage-backed securities held (f)   $ 417     $ 92             CASH FLOWS – Three months ended June 30, 2015                    Sales of loans (c)   $ 2,015     $ 1,159           Repurchases of previously transferred loans (d)   $ 134                 Servicing fees (e)   $ 82     $ 36     $ 4     Servicing advances recovered/(funded), net   $ 47     $ 21     $ 1     Cash flows on mortgage-backed securities held (f)   $ 429     $ 54             CASH FLOWS – Six months ended June 30, 2016                    Sales of loans (c)   $ 2,846     $ 1,454           Repurchases of previously transferred loans (d)   $ 263                 Servicing fees (e)   $ 186     $ 62     $ 6     Servicing advances recovered/(funded), net   $ 76     $ 7     $ 20     Cash flows on mortgage-backed securities held (f)   $ 769     $ 197             CASH FLOWS – Six months ended June 30, 2015                    Sales of loans (c)   $ 3,955     $ 2,179           Repurchases of previously transferred loans (d)   $ 303           $ 2     Servicing fees (e)   $ 165     $ 68     $ 8     Servicing advances recovered/(funded), net   $ 38     $ 28     $ 25     Cash flows on mortgage-backed securities held (f)   $ 669     $ 114              (a) Represents cash flow information associated with both commercial mortgage loan transfer and servicing activities.    (b) These activities were part of an acquired brokered home equity lending business in which PNC is no longer engaged.    (c) Gains/losses recognized on sales of loans were insignificant for the periods presented.    (d) Includes residential mortgage government insured or guaranteed loans eligible for repurchase through the exercise of our Removal of Account Provision (ROAP) option, and loans repurchased due to alleged breaches of origination covenants or representations and warranties made to purchasers. Includes home equity lines of credit repurchased at the end of their draw periods due to contractual requirements.    (e) Includes contractually specified servicing fees, late charges and ancillary fees.    (f) Represents cash flows on securities we hold issued by a securitization SPE in which PNC transferred to and/or services loans. The carrying values of such securities held were $6.4 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $1.1 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities at June 30, 2016 and $5.6 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $1.2 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities at June 30, 2015. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, the carrying values of such securities held were $6.6 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $1.3 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities.  The table below presents information about the principal balances of transferred loans that we service and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would only experience a loss on these transferred loans if we were required to repurchase a loan due to a breach in representations and warranties or a loss sharing arrangement associated with our continuing involvement with these loans. For more information regarding our recourse and repurchase obligations, including our reserve of estimated losses, see the Recourse and Repurchase Obligations section of Note 21 Commitments and Guarantees in our 2015 Form 10-K.    50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Table 43: Principal Balance, Delinquent Loans, and  Net Charge-offs Related to Serviced Loans For Others                    In millions   ResidentialMortgages     CommercialMortgages (a)     Home EquityLoans/Lines (b)     June 30, 2016                    Total principal balance   $ 69,268     $ 49,625     $ 2,533     Delinquent loans (c)   $ 1,555     $ 1,035     $ 893     December 31, 2015                    Total principal balance   $ 72,898     $ 53,789     $ 2,806     Delinquent loans (c)   $ 1,923     $ 1,057     $ 904     Three months ended June 30, 2016                    Net charge-offs (d)   $ 28     $ 157     $ 9     Three months ended June 30, 2015                    Net charge-offs (d)   $ 37     $ 148     $ 8     Six months ended June 30, 2016                    Net charge-offs (d)   $ 54     $ 1,069     $ 16     Six months ended June 30, 2015                    Net charge-offs (d)   $ 69     $ 255     $ 15      (a) Represents information at the securitization level in which PNC has sold loans and is the servicer for the securitization.    (b) These activities were part of an acquired brokered home equity lending business in which PNC is no longer engaged.    (c) Serviced delinquent loans are 90 days or more past due or are in process of foreclosure.    (d) Net charge-offs for Residential mortgages and Home equity loans/lines represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported to investors during the period. Net charge-offs for Commercial mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported by the trustee for commercial mortgage backed securitizations. Realized losses for Agency securitizations are not reflected as we do not manage the underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to loss information.  Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)  As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2015 Form 10-K, we are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be VIEs. The following provides a summary of VIEs, including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Amounts presented for June 30, 2016 are based on the assessments performed in accordance with ASC 810 as amended by ASU 2015-02 and adopted in the first quarter of 2016. Specifically, the ASU modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities (VOEs). We have not provided additional financial support to these entities which we are not contractually required to provide.

(b) Amounts for June 30, 2016 reflect the first quarter 2016 adoption of ASU 2015-02.  The following table provides a summary of non-consolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement but are not the primary beneficiary. We do not consider our continuing involvement to be significant when it relates to a VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or where no transfers have occurred between PNC and the VIE. We have excluded certain transactions with non-consolidated VIEs from the balances presented in Table 45 where we have determined that our continuing involvement is not significant.  In addition, where PNC only has lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these transactions with non-consolidated entities from the balances presented in Table 45. These loans are included as part of the asset quality disclosures that we make in Note 3 Asset Quality.

(e) Included in Loans, Equity investments and Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (f) Included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (g) Included in Deposits and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  We make certain equity investments in various tax credit limited partnerships or limited liability companies (LLCs). The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $105 million of amortization, $111 million of tax credits, and $38 million of other tax benefits associated with qualified investments in low income housing tax credits within Income taxes. The amounts for the second quarter of 2016 were $53 million, $55 million and $19 million, respectively.  NOTE 3 ASSET QUALITY  We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates may be a key indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the loan portfolios. The measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale, purchased impaired loans, nonperforming loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option which are on nonaccrual status, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and accruing loans accounted for under the fair value option.  Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans as these loans are accounted for at fair value. However, when nonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is not recognized on these loans. Additionally, certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest. Purchased impaired loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional delinquency, nonperforming, and charge-off information.    52 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    The following tables display the delinquency status of our loans and our nonperforming assets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Recorded investment in a loan includes the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest and net accounting adjustments, less any charge-offs. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.    (b) Past due loan amounts exclude purchased impaired loans, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.    (c) Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option for which we do not expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are subject to nonaccrual accounting and classification upon meeting any of our nonaccrual policies. Given that these loans are not accounted for at amortized cost, these loans have been excluded from the nonperforming loan population.    (d) Net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees, unamortized discounts and premiums, and purchase discounts and premiums totaling $1.4 billion at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    (e) Future accretable yield related to purchased impaired loans is not included in the analysis of loan portfolio.    (f) Past due loan amounts at June 30, 2016 include government insured or guaranteed Residential real estate mortgages totaling $57 million for 30 to 59 days past due, $47 million for 60 to 89 days past due and $466 million for 90 days or more past due. Past due loan amounts at December 31, 2015 include government insured or guaranteed Residential real estate mortgages totaling $56 million for 30 to 59 days past due, $45 million for 60 to 89 days past due and $545 million for 90 days or more past due.    (g) Past due loan amounts at June 30, 2016 include government insured or guaranteed Other consumer loans totaling $110 million for 30 to 59 days past due, $64 million for 60 to 89 days past due and $184 million for 90 days or more past due. Past due loan amounts at December 31, 2015 include government insured or guaranteed Other consumer loans totaling $116 million for 30 to 59 days past due, $75 million for 60 to 89 days past due and $220 million for 90 days or more past due.  At June 30, 2016, we pledged $20.9 billion of commercial loans to the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) and $58.1 billion of residential real estate and other loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) as collateral for the contingent ability to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2015 were $20.2 billion and $56.4 billion, respectively.

(b) Nonperforming loans exclude certain government insured or guaranteed loans, loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and purchased impaired loans.    (c) The recorded investment of loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure was $.4 billion and $.6 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, both included $.3 billion of loans that are government insured/guaranteed.  Nonperforming loans also include certain loans whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are considered TDRs. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K and the TDR section within this Note.  Total nonperforming loans in the nonperforming assets table above include TDRs of $1.2 billion at June 30, 2016 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015. TDRs that are performing, including consumer credit card TDR loans, totaled $1.2 billion at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and are excluded from nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are returned to accrual and classified as performing after demonstrating a period of at least six months of consecutive performance under the restructured terms. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.  Additional Asset Quality Indicators  We have two overall portfolio segments – Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending. Each of these two segments is comprised of multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in initial measurement, risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. The Commercial Lending segment is comprised of the commercial, commercial real estate, equipment lease financing, and commercial purchased impaired loan classes. The Consumer Lending segment is comprised of the home equity, residential real estate, credit card, other consumer, and consumer purchased impaired loan classes.  Commercial Lending Asset Classes  Commercial Loan Class  For commercial loans, we monitor the performance of the borrower in a disciplined and regular manner based upon the level of credit risk inherent in the loan. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign an internal risk rating reflecting the borrower’s PD and LGD. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process on an ongoing basis. These ratings are reviewed and updated, generally at least once per year. Additionally, no less frequently than on an annual basis, we review PD rates related to each rating grade based upon internal historical data. These rates are updated as needed and augmented by market data as deemed necessary. For small balance homogeneous pools of commercial loans, mortgages and leases, we apply statistical modeling to assist in determining the probability of default within these pools. Further, on a periodic basis, we update our LGD estimates associated with each rating grade based upon historical data. The combination of the PD and LGD ratings assigned to a commercial loan, capturing both the combination of expectations of default and loss severity in event of default, reflects the relative estimated likelihood of loss for that loan at the reporting date. In general, loans with better PD and LGD tend to have a lower likelihood of loss compared to loans with worse PD and LGD. The loss amount also considers an estimate of exposure at date of default, which we also periodically update based upon historical data.  Based upon the amount of the lending arrangement and our risk rating assessment, we follow a formal schedule of written periodic review. Quarterly, we conduct formal reviews of a market’s or business unit’s entire loan portfolio, focusing on those loans which we perceive to be of higher risk, based upon PDs and LGDs, or loans for which credit quality is weakening. If circumstances warrant, it is our practice to review any customer obligation and its level of credit risk more frequently. We attempt to proactively manage our loans by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan, including ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal.     54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Commercial Real Estate Loan Class  We manage credit risk associated with our commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks connected with commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgage activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure and collateral location, project progress and business environment. As a result, these attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk.  As with the commercial class, a formal schedule of periodic review is also performed to assess market/geographic risk and business unit/industry risk. Often as a result of these overviews, more in-depth reviews and increased scrutiny are placed on areas of higher risk, including adverse changes in risk ratings, deteriorating operating trends, and/or areas that concern management. These reviews are designed to assess risk and take actions to mitigate our exposure to such risks.  Equipment Lease Financing Loan Class  We manage credit risk associated with our equipment lease financing loan class similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD.  Based upon the dollar amount of the lease and of the level of credit risk, we follow a formal schedule of periodic review. Generally, this occurs quarterly, although we have established practices to review such credit risk more frequently if circumstances warrant. Our review process entails analysis of the following factors: equipment value/residual value, exposure levels, jurisdiction risk, industry risk, guarantor requirements, and regulatory compliance.  Commercial Purchased Impaired Loan Class  Estimates of the expected cash flows primarily determine the valuation of commercial purchased impaired loans. Commercial cash flow estimates are influenced by a number of credit related items, which include but are not limited to: estimated collateral value, receipt of additional collateral, secondary trading prices, circumstances of possible and/or ongoing liquidation, capital availability, business operations and payment patterns.  We attempt to proactively manage these factors by using various procedures that are customized to the risk of a given loan. These procedures include a review by our Special Asset Committee (SAC), ongoing outreach, contact, and assessment of obligor financial conditions, collateral inspection and appraisal.

We apply a split rating classification to certain loans meeting threshold criteria. By assigning a split classification, a loan’s exposure amount may be split into more than one classification category in the above table.    (b) Loans are included above based on the Regulatory Classification definitions of “Pass”, “Special Mention”, “Substandard” and “Doubtful”.    (c) Special Mention rated loans have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of repayment prospects at some future date. These loans do not expose us to sufficient risk to warrant a more adverse classification at this time.    (d) Substandard rated loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.    (e) Doubtful rated loans possess all the inherent weaknesses of a Substandard loan with the additional characteristics that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full improbable due to existing facts, conditions, and values.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 55     Consumer Lending Asset Classes  Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loan Classes  We use several credit quality indicators, including delinquency information, nonperforming loan information, updated credit scores, originated and updated LTV ratios, and geography, to monitor and manage credit risk within the home equity and residential real estate loan classes. We evaluate mortgage loan performance by source originators and loan servicers. A summary of asset quality indicators follows:  Delinquency/Delinquency Rates: We monitor trending of delinquency/delinquency rates for home equity and residential real estate loans. See the Asset Quality section of this Note 3 for additional information.  Nonperforming Loans: We monitor trending of nonperforming loans for home equity and residential real estate loans. See the Asset Quality section of this Note 3 for additional information.  Credit Scores: We use a national third-party provider to update FICO credit scores for home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans at least quarterly. The updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management reports, which are utilized to monitor the risk in the loan classes.  LTV (inclusive of combined loan-to-value (CLTV) for first and subordinate lien positions): At least annually, we update the property values of real estate collateral and calculate an updated LTV ratio. For open-end credit lines secured by real estate in regions experiencing significant declines in property values, more frequent valuations may occur. We examine LTV migration and stratify LTV into categories to monitor the risk in the loan classes.  Historically, we used, and we continue to use, a combination of original LTV and updated LTV for internal risk management and reporting purposes (e.g., line management, loss mitigation strategies). In addition to the fact that estimated property values by their nature are estimates, given certain data limitations it is important to note that updated LTVs may be based upon management’s assumptions (e.g., if an updated LTV is not provided by the third-party service provider, home price index (HPI) changes will be incorporated in arriving at management’s estimate of updated LTV).  Geography: Geographic concentrations are monitored to evaluate and manage exposures. Loan purchase programs are sensitive to, and focused within, certain regions to manage geographic exposures and associated risks.  A combination of updated FICO scores, originated and updated LTV ratios and geographic location assigned to home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans is used to monitor the risk in the loan classes. Loans with higher FICO scores and lower LTVs tend to have a lower level of risk. Conversely, loans with lower FICO scores, higher LTVs, and in certain geographic locations tend to have a higher level of risk.  Consumer Purchased Impaired Loan Class  Estimates of the expected cash flows primarily determine the valuation of consumer purchased impaired loans. Consumer cash flow estimates are influenced by a number of credit related items, which include, but are not limited to: estimated real estate values, payment patterns, updated FICO scores, the current economic environment, updated LTV ratios and the date of origination.

(b) Amounts shown represent recorded investment.    (c) Based upon updated LTV (inclusive of combined loan-to-value (CLTV) for first and subordinate lien positions). Updated LTV is estimated using modeled property values. These ratios are updated at least semi-annually. The related estimates and inputs are based upon an approach that uses a combination of third-party automated valuation models (AVMs), broker price opinions (BPOs), HPI indices, property location, internal and external balance information, origination data and management assumptions. We generally utilize origination lien balances provided by a third-party, where applicable, which do not include an amortization assumption when calculating updated LTV. Accordingly, the results of these calculations do not represent actual appraised loan level collateral or updated LTV based upon lien balances held by others, and as such, are necessarily imprecise and subject to change as we enhance our methodology.    (d) Higher risk loans are defined as loans with both an updated FICO score of less than or equal to 660 and an updated LTV greater than or equal to 100%.

Other consumer loan classes include education, automobile, and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. Along with the trending of delinquencies and losses for each class, FICO credit score updates are generally obtained monthly, as well as a variety of credit bureau attributes. Loans with high FICO scores tend to have a lower likelihood of loss. Conversely, loans with low FICO scores tend to have a higher likelihood of loss.

The majority of the June 30, 2016 balance related to higher risk credit card loans was geographically distributed throughout the following areas: Ohio 17%, Pennsylvania 16%, Michigan 8%, New Jersey 8%, Florida 7%, Illinois 6%, Maryland 5%, Kentucky 4%, and Indiana 4%. All other states had less than 4% individually and make up the remainder of the balance. At December 31, 2015, we had $34 million of credit card loans that are higher risk. The majority of the December 31, 2015 balance related to higher risk credit card loans was geographically distributed throughout the following areas: Ohio 17%, Pennsylvania 15%, Michigan 8%, New Jersey 8%, Florida 7%, Illinois 6%, Indiana 6%, Maryland 4% and North Carolina 4%. All other states had less than 4% individually and make up the remainder of the balance.    (b) Other consumer loans for which updated FICO scores are used as an asset quality indicator include non-government guaranteed or insured education loans, automobile loans and other secured and unsecured lines and loans. Other consumer loans for which other internal credit metrics are used as an asset quality indicator include primarily government guaranteed or insured education loans, as well as consumer loans to high net worth individuals. Other internal credit metrics may include delinquency status, geography or other factors.    (c) Credit card loans and other consumer loans with no FICO score available or required generally refers to new accounts issued to borrowers with limited credit history, accounts for which we cannot obtain an updated FICO score (e.g., recent profile changes), cards issued with a business name, and/or cards secured by collateral. Management proactively assesses the risk and size of this loan portfolio and, when necessary, takes actions to mitigate the credit risk.    (d) Weighted-average updated FICO score excludes accounts with no FICO score available or required.

Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 59    We held specific reserves in the ALLL of $.4 billion and $.3 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, for the total TDR portfolio.  Table 54 quantifies the number of loans that were classified as TDRs as well as the change in the loans’ recorded investment as a result of becoming a TDR during the first six months and second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, the table provides information about the types of TDR concessions. See Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional discussion of TDR concessions.

(b) Represents the recorded investment of the loans as of the quarter end prior to TDR designation, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable.    (c) Represents the recorded investment of the TDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the TDR occurs, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable.    (d) Includes principal forgiveness and accrued interest forgiveness. These types of TDRs result in a write down of the recorded investment and a charge-off if such action has not already taken place.    (e) Includes reduced interest rate and interest deferral. The TDRs within this category result in reductions to future interest income.    (f) Primarily includes consumer borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC, as well as postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and contractual extensions for both consumer and commercial borrowers.  After a loan is determined to be a TDR, we continue to track its performance under its most recent restructured terms. We consider a TDR to have subsequently defaulted when it becomes 60 days past due after the most recent date the loan was restructured. The recorded investment of loans that were both (i) classified as TDRs or were subsequently modified during each 12-month period preceding January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2015, respectively, and (ii) subsequently defaulted during the three months and six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $38 million and $59 million, respectively. The comparable amounts for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $27 million and $45 million, respectively.  See Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional discussion on TDRs.    60 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Impaired Loans  Impaired loans include commercial nonperforming loans and consumer and commercial TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. TDRs that were previously recorded at amortized cost and are now classified and accounted for as held for sale are also included. Excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans accounted for as held for sale other than the TDRs described in the preceding sentence, loans accounted for under the fair value option, smaller balance homogeneous type loans and purchased impaired loans. Nonperforming equipment lease financing loans of $19 million and $7 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are excluded from impaired loans pursuant to authoritative lease accounting guidance. We did not recognize any interest income on impaired loans that have not returned to performing status, while they were impaired during the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015. The following table provides further detail on impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment and the associated ALLL. Certain commercial and consumer impaired loans do not have a related ALLL as the valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the recorded investment.

We use the two main portfolio segments – Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending – and develop and document the ALLL under separate methodologies for each of these segments as discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies of our 2015 Form 10-K. A rollforward of the ALLL and associated loan data follows.

(b) Includes $149 million of loans collectively evaluated for impairment based upon collateral values and written down to the respective collateral value less costs to sell at June 30, 2016. Accordingly, there is no allowance recorded on these loans. The comparative amount as of June 30, 2015 was $174 million.    (c) Loans accounted for under the fair value option are not evaluated for impairment as these loans are accounted for at fair value. Accordingly, there is no allowance recorded on these loans.    (d) See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our change in derecognition policy effective December 31, 2015 for certain purchased impaired loans.  Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit  We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred on these unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet date as discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies of our 2015 Form 10-K. A rollforward of the allowance is presented below.

The amortized cost of held to maturity securities included net unrealized gains of $84 million and $97 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to securities transferred, which are offset in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, net of tax.    The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in Shareholders’ equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, unless credit-related. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At June 30, 2016, Accumulated other comprehensive income included pretax gains of $98 million from derivatives that hedged the purchase of investment securities classified as held to maturity. The gains will be accreted into interest income as an adjustment of yield on the securities.  Table 59 presents gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The securities are segregated between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. The table includes debt securities where a portion of other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) has been recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The decrease in total unrealized losses at June 30, 2016 when compared to December 31, 2015 was due to a decline in market interest rates.

The gross unrealized loss on debt securities held to maturity was $10 million at June 30, 2016, with less than $.5 million of the loss related to securities with a fair value of $.2 billion that had been in a continuous loss position less than 12 months and $10 million of the loss related to securities with a fair value of $.9 billion that had been in a continuous loss position for more than 12 months. The gross unrealized loss on debt securities held to maturity was $82 million at December 31, 2015, with $59 million of the loss related to securities with a fair value of $5.5 billion that had been in a continuous loss position less than 12 months and $23 million of the loss related to securities with a fair value of $953 million that had been in a continuous loss position for more than 12 months. For securities transferred to held to maturity from available for sale, the unrealized loss for purposes of this analysis is determined by comparing the security’s original amortized cost to its current estimated fair value.  Evaluating Investment Securities for Other-than-Temporary Impairments  For the securities in the preceding Table 59, as of June 30, 2016 we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.  As more fully described in Note 6 Investment Securities in our 2015 Form 10-K, at least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level assessment on all securities. For those securities in an unrealized loss position we determine if OTTI exists. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis. An OTTI loss must be recognized for a debt security in an unrealized loss position if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security     66 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. Even if we do not expect to sell the security, we must evaluate the expected cash flows to be received to determine if we believe a credit loss has occurred. In the event of a credit loss, only the amount of impairment associated with the credit loss is recognized in income. The portion of the unrealized loss relating to other factors, such as liquidity conditions in the market or changes in market interest rates, is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). See Note 6 Investment Securities in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional details on this quarterly assessment.  For those securities on our balance sheet where we determined losses represented OTTI, we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.1 billion at June 30, 2016. During the first six months of 2016 and 2015, the OTTI credit losses recognized   in noninterest income and the OTTI noncredit losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, on securities were not significant.  Information relating to gross realized securities gains and losses from the sales of securities is set forth in the following table.

NOTE 6 FAIR VALUE  Fair Value Measurement  PNC measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with GAAP. Fair value is defined in GAAP as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date. GAAP focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. GAAP also establishes a fair value hierarchy to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy see Note 7 Fair Value in our 2015 Form 10-K.  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  For more information on the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, see Note 7 Fair Value in our 2015 Form 10-K.

(b) Amounts at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are presented gross and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow PNC to net positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the net asset amounts were $3.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and the net liability amounts were $.6 billion and $.6 billion, respectively.    (c) Included in Loans held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. PNC has elected the fair value option for certain residential and commercial mortgage loans held for sale.    (d) Fair value includes net unrealized gains of $79 million at June 30, 2016 compared with net unrealized gains of $23 million at December 31, 2015.    (e) In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (f) The indirect equity funds are not redeemable, but PNC receives distributions over the life of the partnership from liquidation of the underlying investments by the investee, which we expect to occur over the next twelve years. The amount of unfunded contractual commitments as of June 30, 2016 related to indirect equity investments was $109 million and related to direct equity investments was $22 million, respectively. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2015 were $103 million and $23 million, respectively.    (g) Included in Federal funds sold and resale agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

are bracketed while losses for liabilities are not.    (b) The amount of the total gains or losses for the period included in earnings that is attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses related to those assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period.    (c) Reflects transfers into Level 3 associated with a change in valuation methodology.    (d) Net losses (realized and unrealized) included in earnings relating to Level 3 assets and liabilities were $98 million for the second quarter of 2016, while for the first six months of 2016 there were $267 million of net losses (realized and unrealized) included in earnings. The comparative amounts included net gains (realized and unrealized) of $267 million for the second quarter of 2015 and net gains (realized and unrealized) of $321 million for the first six months of 2015. These amounts also included amortization and accretion. The amortization and accretion amounts were included in Interest income on the Consolidated Income Statement, and the remaining net gains/(losses) (realized and unrealized) were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.    (e) Net unrealized losses relating to those assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period were $128 million for the second quarter of 2016, while for the first six months of 2016 there were $337 million of net unrealized losses. The comparative amounts included net unrealized gains of $228 million for the second quarter of 2015 and net unrealized gains of $221 million for the first six months of 2015. These amounts were included in Noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement.    (f) Includes swaps entered into in connection with sales of certain Visa Class B common shares.  An instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. PNC’s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of the reporting period.

2016 totaling $3,018 million and $405 million, respectively, were priced by a third-party vendor using a discounted cash flow pricing model that incorporates consensus pricing, where available. The comparable amounts as of December 31, 2015 were $3,379 million and $448 million, respectively. The significant unobservable inputs for these securities were provided by the third-party vendor and are disclosed in the table. Our procedures to validate the prices provided by the third-party vendor related to these securities are discussed further in the Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis section of Note 7 Fair Value in our 2015 Form 10-K. Certain Level 3 residential mortgage-backed non-agency and asset-backed securities with fair values as of June 30, 2016 of $539 million and $31 million, respectively, were valued using a pricing source, such as a dealer quote or comparable security price, for which the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the price were not reasonably available. The comparable amounts as of December 31, 2015 were $629 million and $34 million, respectively.    (b) The assumed yield spread over the benchmark curve for each instrument is generally intended to incorporate non-interest-rate risks, such as credit and liquidity risks.    (c) Consensus pricing refers to fair value estimates that are generally internally developed using information such as dealer quotes or other third-party provided valuations or comparable asset prices.    (d) Represents the aggregate amount of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis that are individually and in the aggregate insignificant. The amount includes certain financial derivative assets and liabilities, trading securities, state and municipal securities, other debt securities, residential mortgage loans held for sale, other assets, other borrowed funds (ROAPs) and other liabilities. For additional information, please see the Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis discussion included in Note 7 Fair Value in our 2015 Form 10-K.    (e) Consisted of total Level 3 assets of $8,188 million and total Level 3 liabilities of $406 million as of June 30, 2016 and $8,606 million and $495 million as of December 31, 2015, respectively.  Financial Assets Accounted for at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  We may be required to measure certain financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower of amortized cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment and are included in Table 66 and Table 67. For more information regarding the valuation methodologies of our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, see Note 7 Fair Value in our 2015 Form 10-K.

The aggregate fair values in the preceding table represent only a portion of the total market value of PNC’s assets and liabilities as, in accordance with the guidance related to fair values of financial instruments, Table 70 excludes the following:      •    financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis,      •    real and personal property,      •    lease financing,      •    loan customer relationships,      •    deposit customer intangibles,      •    mortgage servicing rights,      •    retail branch networks,      •    fee-based businesses, such as asset management and brokerage, and      •    trademarks and brand names.     78 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    For more information regarding the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments included in Table 70, see Note 7 Fair Value in our 2015 Form 10-K.  NOTE 7 GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Goodwill  See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets of our 2015 Form 10-K for more information regarding our goodwill.  Mortgage Servicing Rights  We recognize the right to service mortgage loans for others as an intangible asset. MSRs are purchased or originated when loans are sold with servicing retained. MSRs totaled $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and consisted of loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential mortgages measured at fair value.  MSRs are subject to declines in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of MSRs decreases (or increases).  See the Sensitivity Analysis section of this Note 7, as well as Note 6 Fair Value for more detail on our fair value measurement of MSRs. Refer to Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in our 2015 Form 10-K for more information on our accounting and measurement of MSRs.  Changes in the commercial and residential MSRs follow:  Table 71: Mortgage Servicing Rights                                  Commercial MSRs     Residential MSRs    In millions   2016     2015     2016     2015     January 1   $ 526     $ 506     $ 1,063     $ 845     Additions:                         From loans sold with servicing retained     23       34       23       38     Purchases     9       28       105       150     Changes in fair value due to:                         Time and payoffs (a)     (46 )      (43 )      (78 )      (86 )    Other (b)     (64 )      18       (339 )      68     June 30   $ 448     $ 543     $ 774     $ 1,015     Related unpaid principal balance at June 30   $ 142,968     $ 144,416     $ 126,172     $ 115,454     Servicing advances at June 30   $ 244     $ 271     $ 335     $ 463      (a) Represents decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and loans that were paid down or paid off during the period.    (b) Represents MSR value changes resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates.    Sensitivity Analysis  The fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of June 30, 2016 are shown in the tables below. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses both internal proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are   consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate.  A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented below. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for example, changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 79      changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.  The following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and the sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions:  Table 72: Commercial Mortgage Loan Servicing Rights – Key Valuation Assumptions                Dollars in millions   June 302016     December 312015     Fair value   $ 448     $ 526     Weighted-average life (years)     4.5       4.7     Weighted-average constant prepayment rate     8.19 %      5.71 %    Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change   $ 10     $ 10     Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change   $ 19     $ 19     Effective discount rate     7.44 %      7.49 %    Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change   $ 12     $ 14     Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change   $ 24     $ 29    Table 73: Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing Rights – Key Valuation Assumptions               Dollars in millions   June 302016     December 312015     Fair value   $ 774     $ 1,063     Weighted-average life (years)     4.1       6.3     Weighted-average constant prepayment rate     19.19 %      10.61 %    Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change   $ 50     $ 44     Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change   $ 95     $ 85     Weighted-average option adjusted spread     865bps       893bps     Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change   $ 23     $ 34     Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change   $ 44     $ 67    Fees from mortgage loan servicing, which includes contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and ancillary fees were $.1 billion for both the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and $.3 billion and $.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also generate servicing fees from fee-based activities provided to others for which we do not have an associated servicing asset. Fees from commercial and residential MSRs are reported on our Consolidated Income Statement in the line items Corporate services and Residential mortgage, respectively.  Other Intangible Assets  Other intangible assets consist primarily of core deposit intangibles, customer lists and non-compete agreements. See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets of our 2015 Form 10-K for more information regarding our other intangible assets.  NOTE 8 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  Pension And Postretirement Plans  As described in Note 12 Employee Benefit Plans in our 2015 Form 10-K, we have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Any pension contributions to the plan are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants.  We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. PNC reserves the right to terminate or make changes to these plans at any time. The nonqualified pension is unfunded.  The components of our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were as follows:     80 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table 74: Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs                                   Qualified Pension Plan     Nonqualified Retirement Plans     Postretirement Benefits     Three months ended June 30 In millions   2016     2015     2016     2015     2016     2015     Net periodic cost consists of:                                  Service cost   $ 25     $ 26     $ 1     $ 1     $ 2     $ 2     Interest cost     47       45       3       3       3       3     Expected return on plan assets     (71 )      (74 )                (1 )          Amortization of prior service credit     (1 )      (2 )                (1 )          Amortization of actuarial losses     11       8       1       1                     Net periodic cost/(benefit)   $ 11     $ 3     $ 5     $ 5     $ 3     $ 5                                     Qualified Pension Plan     Nonqualified Retirement Plans     Postretirement Benefits     Six months ended June 30 In millions   2016     2015     2016     2015     2016     2015     Net periodic cost consists of:                                  Service cost   $ 51     $ 53     $ 1     $ 1     $ 3     $ 3     Interest cost     93       89       6       6       7       7     Expected return on plan assets     (141 )      (148 )                (2 )          Amortization of prior service credit     (3 )      (4 )                (1 )          Amortization of actuarial losses     22       15       2       3                     Net periodic cost/(benefit)   $ 22     $ 5     $ 9     $ 10     $ 7     $ 10    NOTE 9 FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES  We use derivative financial instruments (derivatives) primarily to help manage exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk and reduce the effects that changes in interest rates may have on net income, the fair value of assets and liabilities, and cash flows. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.  For more information regarding derivatives see Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 14 Financial Derivatives in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K.  The following table presents the notional amounts and gross fair values of all derivative assets and liabilities held by PNC:  Table 75: Total Gross Derivatives                                    June 30, 2016     December 31, 2015    In millions   Notional/ContractAmount     AssetFairValue (a)     LiabilityFairValue (b)     Notional/ContractAmount     AssetFairValue (a)     LiabilityFairValue (b)     Derivatives designated as hedging instruments under GAAP   $ 53,982     $ 2,011     $ 351     $ 52,074     $ 1,159     $ 174     Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP     302,743       6,216       5,717       295,902       3,782       3,628     Total gross derivatives   $ 356,725     $ 8,227     $ 6,068     $ 347,976     $ 4,941     $ 3,802      (a) Included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (b) Included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  All derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion regarding the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable master netting agreements is included in the Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features section below. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of the derivatives.  Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAP  Certain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are considered cash flow    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 81     hedges, and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and losses on those derivatives, to the extent effective, to be recognized in the income statement in the same period the hedged items affect earnings.  Further detail regarding the notional amounts and fair values related to derivatives designated in hedge relationships is presented in the following table:  Table 76: Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAP                                   June 30, 2016     December 31, 2015    In millions   Notional/ContractAmount     AssetFairValue (a)     LiabilityFairValue (b)     Notional/ContractAmount     AssetFairValue (a)     LiabilityFairValue (b)     Interest rate contracts:                                  Fair value hedges:                                  Receive-fixed swaps   $ 27,692     $ 1,234          $ 25,756     $ 699     $ 18     Pay-fixed swaps (c)     5,502             $ 351       5,934       13       153     Subtotal     33,194       1,234       351       31,690       712       171     Cash flow hedges:                                  Receive-fixed swaps     16,871       604            17,879       412       2     Forward purchase commitments     2,900       34               1,400       4       1     Subtotal     19,771       638            19,279       416       3     Foreign exchange contracts:                                  Net investment hedges     1,017       139               1,105       31             Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments   $ 53,982     $ 2,011     $ 351     $ 52,074     $ 1,159     $ 174      (a) Included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (b) Included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.    (c) Includes zero-coupon swaps.  Fair Value Hedges  We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. For these hedge relationships, we use statistical regression analysis to assess hedge effectiveness at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  Further detail regarding gains (losses) on fair value hedge derivatives and related hedged items is presented in the following table:  Table 77: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives and Related Hedged Items – Fair Value Hedges (a)                                                        Three months ended     Six months ended                June 30, 2016     June 30, 2015     June 30, 2016     June 30, 2015    In millions   Hedged Items   Location    Gain (Loss) on Derivatives Recognized in Income       Gain(Loss) on Related Hedged Items Recognized in Income      Gain(Loss) onDerivativesRecognizedin Income       Gain(Loss) on Related Hedged Items Recognized in Income     Gain(Loss) onDerivativesRecognizedin Income       Gain(Loss) on Related Hedged Items Recognized in Income       Gain (Loss) on Derivatives Recognized in Income      Gain(Loss) on Related Hedged Items Recognized in Income     Interest rate contracts   U.S. Treasury and Government Agencies and Other Debt Securities   Investment securities (interest income)   $ (55 )    $ 56     $ 64     $ (66 )    $ (209 )    $ 214     $ 12     $ (12 )    Interest rate contracts   Subordinated Debt and Bank Notes and Senior Debt   Borrowed funds (interest expense)     155       (168 )      (264 )      259       562       (600 )      (107 )      87     Total (a)           $ 100     $ (112 )    $ (200 )    $ 193     $ 353     $ (386 )    $ (95 )    $ 75      (a) The difference between the gains (losses) recognized in income on derivatives and their related hedged items represents the ineffective portion of the change in value of our fair value hedge derivatives.    82 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Cash Flow Hedges  We enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. For these cash flow hedges, any changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are effective in offsetting changes in the forecasted interest cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are reclassified to interest income in conjunction with the recognition of interest received on the loans. In the 12 months that follow June 30, 2016, we expect to reclassify from the amount currently reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income, net derivative gains of $216 million pretax, or $140 million after-tax, in association with interest received on the hedged loans. This amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations, and the addition of other hedges subsequent to June 30, 2016. The maximum length of time over which forecasted loan cash flows are hedged is 6 years. We use statistical regression analysis to assess the effectiveness of these hedge relationships at both the inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis.  We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the consideration that will be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. As a result, hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is typically minimal. Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. In the 12 months that follow June 30, 2016, we expect to reclassify from the amount currently reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income, net derivative gains of $65 million pretax, or $42 million after-tax, as adjustments of yield on investment securities. As of June 30, 2016, the maximum length of time over which forecasted purchase contracts are hedged is 3 months.  There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to either cash flow hedge strategy.  During the first six months of 2016 and 2015, there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified to earnings because it became probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.     Further detail regarding gains (losses) on derivatives and related cash flows is presented in the following table:  Table 78: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives and Related Cash Flows – Cash Flow Hedges (a) (b)                             Three months ended June 30      Six months ended June 30    In millions   2016     2015     2016     2015     Gains (losses) on derivatives recognized in OCI – (effective portion)   $ 126     $ (102 )    $ 391     $ 196     Less: Gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income – (effective portion)                        Interest income     64       72       129       140     Noninterest income     (1 )      (4 )      (1 )      (13 )    Total gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income – (effective portion)   $ 63     $ 68     $ 128     $ 127     Net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives   $ 63     $ (170 )    $ 263     $ 69      (a) All cash flow hedge derivatives are interest rate contracts as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015.    (b) The amount of cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recognized in income was not significant for the periods presented.    Net Investment Hedges  We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. Dollar (USD) net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness. During the first six months of 2016 and 2015, there was no net investment hedge ineffectiveness. Gains (losses) on net investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI was net gains   of $80 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and net gains of $109 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with net losses of $65 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and net losses of $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.

Credit Derivatives – Risk Participation Agreements  We have entered into risk participation agreements to share some of the credit exposure with other counterparties related to interest rate derivative contracts or to take on credit exposure to generate revenue. The notional amount of risk participation agreements sold was $3.7 billion at June 30, 2016 and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2015. Assuming all underlying third party customers referenced in the swap contracts defaulted at June 30, 2016, the exposure from these agreements would be $202 million based on the fair value of the underlying swaps, compared with $122 million at December 31, 2015.  Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk, and Contingent Features  We, generally, utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either party’s net position.  For additional information on derivative offsetting, counterparty credit risk, and contingent features see Note 14 Financial Derivatives in our 2015 Form 10-K. Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Guarantees in this Report for additional information related to resale and repurchase agreements offsetting.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 85    The following derivative Table 81 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The table also includes the fair value of any securities collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table only to the extent of the related net derivative fair values.

(b) Represents the net amount of derivative liabilities included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The table above includes over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, cleared derivatives, and exchange-traded derivatives. OTC derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties that are not settled through an organized exchange or cleared through a central clearing house. The majority of OTC derivatives are governed by ISDA documentation or other legally enforceable industry standard master netting agreements. Cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes our counterparty. Exchange-traded derivatives represent standardized futures and options contracts executed directly on an organized exchange.    86 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     In addition to using master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to reduce credit risk associated with derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using internal credit analysis, limits, and monitoring procedures.  At June 30, 2016, we held cash, U.S. government securities and mortgage-backed securities totaling $1.4 billion under master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from counterparties, and we pledged cash totaling $1.7 billion under these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities owed to counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements. These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals may include collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral held or pledged exceeds the net derivative fair values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in   Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held from counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise securities we have pledged to counterparties remain on our balance sheet.  Certain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk related contingent provisions, such as those that require PNC’s debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If PNC’s debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position on June 30, 2016 was $1.3 billion for which PNC had posted collateral of $1.2 billion in the normal course of business.

Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings (“Disclosed Matters,” which are those matters disclosed in this Note 12 as well as those matters disclosed in Note 20 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our 2015 Form 10-K and in Note 14 Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our first quarter 2016 Form 10-Q (such prior disclosure collectively referred to as “Prior Disclosure”)). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, as of June 30, 2016, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $550 million. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount.  In our experience, legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. One or more of the following factors frequently contribute to this inherent unpredictability: the proceeding is in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified,   unsupported or uncertain; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis or, if permitted to proceed as a class action, how the class will be defined; the other party is seeking relief other than or in addition to compensatory damages (including, in the case of regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, the possibility of fines and penalties); the matter presents meaningful legal uncertainties, including novel issues of law; discovery has not started or is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; we have not engaged in meaningful settlement discussions; the possible outcomes may not be amenable to the use of statistical or quantitative analytical tools; predicting possible outcomes depends on making assumptions about future decisions of courts or regulatory bodies or the behavior of other parties; and there are a large number of parties named as defendants (including where it is uncertain how damages or liability, if any, will be shared among multiple defendants). Generally, the less progress that has been made in the proceedings or the broader the range of potential results, the harder it is for us to estimate losses or ranges of losses that it is reasonably possible we could incur.  As a result of these types of factors, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that it is reasonably possible that we could incur or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as discussed below under “Other.”  We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information related to     90 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      the plaintiff’s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff’s pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual.  Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses.  Interchange Litigation  In June 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reached a decision on the appeal of the approval of a settlement of the antitrust lawsuits pending against Visa®, MasterCard®, and several major financial institutions, including cases naming National City (since merged into PNC) and its subsidiary, National City Bank of Kentucky (since merged into National City Bank which in turn was merged into PNC Bank, N.A.), that have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation (Master File No. 1:05-md-1720-JG-JO). In its decision, the court of appeals reversed approval of the settlement and remanded for further proceedings. As a result, the class litigation is expected to resume in the district court.  Lender Placed Insurance Litigation  In February 2014, a class action lawsuit (Montoya, et al. v. PNC Bank, N.A., et al. (Case No. 1:14-cv-20474-JEM)) was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against PNC Bank, American Security Insurance Company (ASIC), a provider of property and casualty insurance to PNC for certain residential mortgages, and its parent, Assurant, Inc. relating to the administration of PNC Bank’s program for placement of insurance for borrowers who fail to obtain hazard insurance coverages required by the terms of their mortgages. In their complaint, the plaintiffs asserted breach of contract by PNC, breach of its duty of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, breach of a fiduciary duty, and violations of Florida and New Jersey statutes pertaining to deceptive and unfair trade practices. They also asserted claims under the federal TILA and RICO statutes. The plaintiffs sought a nationwide class on all claims except the state law statutory claims, for which they sought to certify subclasses of Florida and New Jersey residents, respectively. The plaintiffs sought, among other things, damages (including treble damages), disgorgement of “unjust benefits,” injunctive relief, interest and attorneys’ fees. PNC filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in May 2014. In August 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part PNC’s motion to dismiss. Specifically,   the court dismissed the breach of contract, Florida deceptive and unfair trade practices, and federal TILA and RICO claims, although it allowed the RICO claims to be re-pled. The remaining claims were state claims for breach of the covenant of good faith, unjust enrichment, the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, and breach of fiduciary duty. Thereafter, in September 2014, a third amended complaint was filed. In October 2014, PNC moved to partially dismiss the third amended complaint. The motion to dismiss sought dismissal of the re-pleaded RICO claims and a state law claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of fiduciary duty. At the same time, PNC also moved to strike nationwide class allegations with respect to the state law claims. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs stipulated to this relief, as a result of which the plaintiffs’ state law claims were brought solely as statewide class action claims in the states in which the plaintiffs reside. In January 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. In March 2015, the court denied PNC’s motion to dismiss, except that it granted the motion as to the state law good faith and fair dealing claim.  In May 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle this case on a nationwide settlement class basis. In connection with the settlement agreement, the plaintiffs also filed a fourth amended complaint, which, among other things, added claims regarding wind and flood insurance. The settlement provided for certification of a class of borrowers who were charged by PNC under a hazard, flood, flood gap or wind only lender placed insurance policy for residential property during the period January 1, 2008 through the date of preliminary approval of the settlement. The court granted final approval of the settlement in April 2016. An appeal of this approval filed by an objector has been voluntarily dismissed, as a result of which the case has been concluded. The overall cost of the settlement has been reflected in our reserves and will not be material to PNC.  Other cases making similar allegations were previously dismissed, with plaintiffs in those cases being added as plaintiffs in this case.  Other Regulatory and Governmental Inquiries  PNC is the subject of investigations, audits and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a broad range of issues in our banking, securities and other financial services businesses, in some cases as part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants. Over the last few years, we have experienced an increase in regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries. Areas of current regulatory or governmental inquiry with respect to PNC include consumer protection, fair lending, mortgage origination and servicing, mortgage and non mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance, municipal finance activities, conduct by broker-dealers, automobile lending practices, employment practices, and participation in government insurance or guarantee programs, some of which are described     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 91      in Prior Disclosure. These inquiries, including those described in Prior Disclosure, may lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, and possibly result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs.  Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries, including those described in Prior Disclosure.  Other  In addition to the proceedings or other matters described above and in Prior Disclosure, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.     NOTE 13 COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES  Commitments  In the normal course of business, we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table presents our outstanding commitments to extend credit along with significant other commitments as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Table 86: Commitments to Extend Credit and Other Commitments                In millions   June 302016     December 312015     Commitments to extend credit              Total commercial lending   $ 102,120     $ 101,252     Home equity lines of credit     17,331       17,268     Credit card     21,298       19,937     Other     4,367       4,032     Total commitments to extend credit     145,116       142,489     Net outstanding standby letters of credit (a)     9,089       8,765     Reinsurance agreements (b)     1,917       2,010     Standby bond purchase agreements (c)     872       911     Other commitments (d)     965       966     Total commitments to extend credit and other commitments   $ 157,959     $ 155,141      (a) Net outstanding standby letters of credit include $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion which support remarketing programs at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    (b) Represents aggregate maximum exposure up to the specified limits of the reinsurance contracts, and reflects estimates based on availability of financial information from insurance carriers. As of June 30, 2016, the aggregate maximum exposure amount comprised $1.6 billion for accidental death & dismemberment contracts and $.3 billion for credit life, accident & health contracts. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2015 were $1.6 billion and $.4 billion, respectively.    (c) We enter into standby bond purchase agreements to support municipal bond obligations.    (d) Includes $.4 billion and $.5 billion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Commitments to Extend Credit  Commitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee, and contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates. Based on our historical experience, some commitments expire unfunded, and therefore cash requirements are substantially less than the total commitment.    92 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Net Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit  We issue standby letters of credit and share in the risk of standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to support obligations of our customers to third parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of transactions involving capital markets product execution. Internal credit ratings related to our net outstanding standby letters of credit were as follows:  Table 87: Internal Credit Ratings Related to Net Outstanding Standby Letters of Credit                     June 302016     December 312015     Internal credit ratings (as a percentage of portfolio):              Pass (a)     92 %      93 %    Below pass (b)     8 %      7 %     (a) Indicates that expected risk of loss is currently low.    (b) Indicates a higher degree of risk of default.    If the customer fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract or there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them. The standby letters of credit outstanding on June 30, 2016 had terms ranging from less than 1 year to 9 years.  As of June 30, 2016, assets of $1.1 billion secured certain specifically identified standby letters of credit. In addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit issued on behalf of specific customers is also secured by collateral or guarantees that secure the customers’ other obligations to us. The carrying amount of the liability for our obligations related to standby letters of credit and participations in standby letters of credit was $.2 billion at June 30, 2016 and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Reinsurance Agreements  We have a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary which provides reinsurance for accidental death & dismemberment, credit life, and accident & health, all of which are in run-off. This subsidiary previously entered into these various types of reinsurance agreements with third-party insurers where the subsidiary assumed the risk of loss through quota share agreements up to 100% reinsurance. In quota share agreements, the subsidiary and the third-party insurers share the responsibility for payment of all claims. Recourse and Repurchase Obligations  As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities, PNC has sold commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loans/lines of credit directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets. See Note 21 Commitments and Guarantees in our 2015 Form 10-K for details related to our Recourse and Repurchase Obligations.  Resale and Repurchase Agreements  We enter into repurchase and resale agreements where we transfer investment securities to/from a third party with the agreement to repurchase/resell those investment securities at a future date for a specified price. These agreements are entered into primarily to provide short-term financing for securities inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short positions and accommodate customers’ investing and financing needs. Repurchase and resale agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions for accounting purposes and are generally carried at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently reacquired or resold, including accrued interest. Our policy is to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. We monitor the market value of securities to be repurchased and resold and additional collateral may be obtained where considered appropriate to protect against credit exposure.  Repurchase and resale agreements are typically entered into with counterparties under industry standard master netting agreements which provide for the right to offset amounts owed to one another with respect to multiple repurchase and resale agreements under such master netting agreement (referred to as netting arrangements) and liquidate the purchased or borrowed securities in the event of counterparty default. In order for an arrangement to be eligible for netting under GAAP, we must obtain the requisite assurance that the offsetting rights included in the master netting agreement would be legally enforceable in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar proceeding of such third party. Enforceability is evidenced by obtaining a legal opinion that supports, with sufficient confidence, the enforceability of the master netting agreement in bankruptcy. Table 88 shows the amounts owed under resale and repurchase agreements and the securities collateral associated with those agreements where a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of the offsetting rights has been obtained. We do not present resale and repurchase agreements entered into with the same counterparty under a legally enforceable master netting agreement on a net basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheet or within Table 88.  Refer to Note 9 Financial Derivatives for additional information related to offsetting of financial derivatives.

Repurchase agreements are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements.    (b) Represents the fair value of securities collateral purchased or sold, up to the amount owed under the agreement, for agreements supported by a legally enforceable master netting agreement.    (c) Represents certain long term resale agreements which are fully collateralized but do not have the benefits of a netting opinion and, therefore, might be subject to a stay in insolvency proceedings and therefore are not eligible under ASC 210-20 for netting.    (d) Repurchase agreements have remaining contractual maturities that are classified as overnight or continuous. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the collateral pledged under these agreements consisted primarily of residential mortgage-backed agency securities.    (e) Represents overnight repurchase agreements entered into with municipalities, pension plans, and certain trusts and insurance companies which are fully collateralized but do not have the benefits of a netting opinion and, therefore, might be subject to a stay in insolvency proceedings and therefore are not eligible under ASC 210-20 for netting. There were no long term repurchase agreements as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    NOTE 14 SEGMENT REPORTING  We have six reportable business segments:      •    Retail Banking      •    Corporate & Institutional Banking      •    Asset Management Group      •    Residential Mortgage Banking      •    BlackRock      •    Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio  Results of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period.  Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the results for corporate support functions within “Other” for financial reporting purposes.  Net interest income in business segment results reflects PNC’s internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.  A portion of capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to our business segments using our risk-based economic capital model, including consideration of the goodwill at those business segments, as well as the diversification of risk among the business segments, ultimately reflecting PNC’s portfolio risk adjusted capital allocation.  We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on the loan exposures within each business segment’s portfolio. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.  Our allocation of the costs incurred by operations and other shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services.  Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category in the business segment tables. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities and certain trading activities, exited businesses, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling     94 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      interests as the segments’ results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented for comparative purposes.

Residential Mortgage Banking directly originates first lien residential mortgage loans on a nationwide basis with a significant presence within the retail banking footprint. Mortgage loans represent loans collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate. These loans are typically underwritten to government agency and/or third-party standards, and either sold, servicing retained, or held on PNC’s balance sheet. Loan sales are primarily to secondary mortgage conduits of FNMA, FHLMC, Federal Home Loan Banks and third-party investors, or are securitized and issued under the GNMA program.

At June 30, 2016, our economic interest in BlackRock was 22%. PNC received cash dividends from BlackRock of $165 million and $160 million during the first six months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio includes a consumer portfolio of mainly residential mortgage and brokered home equity loans and lines of credit and a small commercial lending portfolio. We obtained a significant portion of these non-strategic assets through acquisitions of other companies.

(c) To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margin for all earning assets, interest income includes the effects of taxable-equivalent adjustments using a statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable-equivalent basis. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 were $96 million and $98 million, respectively. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2016, March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015 were $48 million, $48 million and $49 million, respectively.

(b) Basel III capital ratios and estimates may be impacted by additional regulatory guidance and, in the case of those ratios calculated using the advanced approaches, may be subject to variability based on the ongoing evolution, validation and regulatory approval of PNC’s models that are integral to the calculation of advanced approaches risk-weighted assets as PNC moves through the parallel run process.    (c) Represents net adjustments related to accumulated other comprehensive income for securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.    (d) Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III standardized approach rules and include credit and market risk-weighted assets.    (e) Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market and operational risk-weighted assets. During the parallel run qualification phase PNC has refined the data, models and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets. Refinements implemented in the fourth quarter of 2015 reduced estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets. We anticipate additional refinements may result in increases or decreases to this estimate through the parallel run qualification phase.    100 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     PART II – OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1.
