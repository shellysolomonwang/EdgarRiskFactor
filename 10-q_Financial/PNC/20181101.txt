For additional information, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2017 Form 10-K.Business OutlookOur forward-looking financial statements are based on our view that U.S. economic growth has accelerated over the past two years and will remain above its long-run trend for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019, in light of stimulus from corporate and personal income tax cuts passed in late 2017 that are expected to support business investment and consumer spending, respectively. We expect an increase in federal government spending will also support economic growth for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. Further gradual improvement in the labor market this year and next, including job gains and rising wages, is another positive for consumer spending. Trade restrictions are a growing downside risk to the forecast. Inflation has accelerated to close to the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2% objective. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected to rise throughout the remainder of 2018 and into 2019; after the Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate in September, our baseline forecast is for one additional rate hike in December 2018, pushing the rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.50% by the end of the year. PNC expects two 25 basis point increases in the fed funds rate in 2019 (in June and September); this would take the fed funds rate to a range of 2.75% to 3.00% by the end of next year.For the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2018, we expect:•Loans to be up modestly;•Net interest income to increase by low single digits, on a percentage basis;•Fee income to increase by low single digits, on a percentage basis. Fee income consists of asset management, consumer services, corporate services, residential mortgage and service charges on deposits;•Provision for credit losses to be between $100 million and $150 million; and•Noninterest expense to increase by low single digits, on a percentage basis.We expect the quarterly run rate for other noninterest income to be in the range of $225 million to $275 million, excluding net securities gains (losses) and Visa activity. We expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 17%.See the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2017 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEWOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.Net income for the third quarter of 2018 was $1.4 billion, or $2.82 per diluted common share, an increase of 24% compared to $1.1 billion, or $2.16 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2017. For the first nine months of 2018, net income was $4.0 billion, or $7.96 per diluted common share, an increase of 21% compared to $3.3 billion, or $6.21 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2017.Net income increased in both comparisons driven by an increase in revenue from higher net interest income and noninterest income and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense.Net Interest IncomeTable 2: Summarized Average Balances and Net Interest Income (a)  20182017 Three months ended September 30Dollars in millions AverageBalances AverageYields/Rates InterestIncome/Expense AverageBalances AverageYields/Rates InterestIncome/Expense Assets             Interest-earning assets             Investment securities $80,766 2.92% $591 $74,406 2.77% $516 Loans 223,342 4.36% 2,474 219,218 3.92% 2,179 Interest-earning deposits with banks 19,151 1.97% 95 23,859 1.26% 75 Other 7,114 5.19% 92 9,024 3.47% 80 Total interest-earning assets/interest income $330,373 3.89% 3,252 $326,507 3.45% 2,850 Liabilities             Interest-bearing liabilities             Interest-bearing deposits $186,320 .71% 336 $180,508 .37% 170 Borrowed funds 59,838 2.76% 421 57,016 1.93% 280 Total interest-bearing liabilities/interest expense $246,158 1.21% 757 $237,524 .75% 450 Net interest margin/income (Non-GAAP)   2.99% 2,495   2.91% 2,400 Taxable-equivalent adjustments     (29)     (55) Net interest income (GAAP)     $2,466     $2,345   2018 2017 Nine months ended September 30Dollars in millions AverageBalances AverageYields/Rates InterestIncome/Expense AverageBalances AverageYields/Rates InterestIncome/Expense Assets             Interest-earning assets             Investment securities $77,656 2.87% $1,674 $75,330 2.71% $1,535 Loans 222,385 4.23% 7,091 215,974 3.81% 6,197 Interest-earning deposits with banks 21,921 1.74% 286 23,530 1.03% 182 Other 7,305 4.74% 259 9,058 3.46% 236 Total interest-earning assets/interest income $329,267 3.75% 9,310 $323,892 3.34% 8,150 Liabilities             Interest-bearing liabilities             Interest-bearing deposits $184,716 .59% 810 $178,810 .32% 433 Borrowed funds 59,481 2.60% 1,173 56,502 1.86% 793 Total interest-bearing liabilities/interest expense $244,197 1.08% 1,983 $235,312 .69% 1,226 Net interest margin/income (Non-GAAP)   2.95% 7,327   2.84% 6,924 Taxable-equivalent adjustments     (87)     (161) Net interest income (GAAP)     $7,240     $6,763 (a)Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of this Report.Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 5Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional information.Net interest income increased by $121 million, or 5%, and $477 million, or 7%, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2017. The increase in both comparisons was driven by higher loan and securities balances and yields partially offset by increases in deposit and borrowing costs. Net interest margin increased in both comparisons reflecting the impact of higher interest rates.Average investment securities increased $6.4 billion, or 9%, in the quarterly comparison and $2.3 billion, or 3%, in the year-to-date comparison. Net purchase activity of agency residential mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury and government agencies securities was partially offset by declines in commercial mortgage-backed and other securities. These comparisons included the impact of the January 1, 2018 reclassification of $.6 billion of available for sale securities to equity investments in accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01. See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q for additional detail on this adoption. Average investment securities increased to 24% of average interest-earning assets for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to 23% for the respective 2017 periods.Average loans grew $4.1 billion, or 2%, and $6.4 billion, or 3%, in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively. Loan growth was driven by increases in average commercial lending of $3.1 billion and $5.7 billion in the respective comparisons reflecting broad-based growth in the Corporate Banking, Business Credit and Equipment Finance businesses in our Corporate & Institutional Banking segment. Average consumer lending increased $1.0 billion and $.7 billion in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively. Growth in residential real estate, automobile and credit card loans was partially offset by declines in home equity and education loans. Lower home equity loans reflected paydowns and payoffs exceeding new originated volume. In addition, run-off in the non-strategic consumer loan portfolios of brokered home equity and government guaranteed education loans contributed to the declines. Average loans represented 68% of average interest-earning assets for the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to 67% for the same periods of 2017.Average interest-bearing deposits grew $5.8 billion, or 3%, and $5.9 billion, or 3%, in the respective quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, reflecting overall deposit and customer growth. Additionally, the increases reflect a shift from noninterest-bearing deposits, which declined $2.8 billion to $76.2 billion and $1.5 billion to $76.7 billion in the respective comparisons, to interest-bearing deposits as deposit rates have risen. Average savings deposits increased $9.1 billion in both comparisons due in part to a shift to relationship-based savings products from money market deposits, which decreased $6.8 billion and $6.1 billion in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively. Additionally, average interest-bearing demand deposits grew $3.4 billion in the quarterly comparison and $3.0 billion in the year-to-date comparison. Average interest-bearing deposits remained stable at 76% of average interest-bearing liabilities in both the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons. Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.Average borrowed funds increased $2.8 billion, or 5%, and $3.0 billion, or 5%, in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, respectively, primarily due to higher bank notes and senior debt and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, partially offset by a decline in subordinated debt. See the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review portion of this Financial Review for additional detail on the level and composition of borrowed funds. 6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QNoninterest IncomeTable 3: Noninterest Income  Three months ended September 30Nine months ended September 30       Change     Change Dollars in millions 20182017 $ % 2018 2017 $ % Noninterest income                 Asset management $486 $421 $65 15 % $1,397 $1,222 $175 14 % Consumer services 377 357 20 6 % 1,115 1,049 66 6 % Corporate services 465 404 61 15 % 1,381 1,284 97 8 % Residential mortgage 76 104 (28) (27)% 257 321 (64) (20)% Service charges on deposits 186 181 5 3 % 522 512 10 2 % Other 301 313 (12) (4)% 880 918 (38) (4)% Total noninterest income $1,891$1,780$111 6 % $5,552$5,306$246 5 %  Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 43% for both of the third quarters in 2018 and 2017. The comparable ratios for the year-to-date periods were 43% and 44%, respectively.Growth in asset management revenue reflected higher earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock which benefited from the lower federal statutory income tax rate as well as stronger equity markets. PNC's discretionary client assets under management increased to $159 billion at September 30, 2018 compared with $146 billion at September 30, 2017.Increases in consumer services revenue in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons were primarily due to growth in debit and credit card fees totaling $12 million and $42 million, respectively, reflecting continued momentum in customer activity in both transaction trends and customer growth. Brokerage fees increased in both comparisons by $10 million and $30 million, respectively, as a result of growth in brokerage assets under management.Higher corporate services revenue in both comparisons was primarily driven by growth in merger and acquisition advisory fees of $35 million and $50 million and treasury management fees of $20 million and $54 million, in the respective comparisons. Additionally, the year-to-date comparison included a $12 million increase in operating lease income related to the commercial and vendor finance business acquired in the second quarter of 2017 and a $15 million lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge.Residential mortgage revenue decreased due to loan sales revenue declines of $18 million and $46 million in the quarterly and year-to-date comparisons, as well as lower servicing revenue and a lower benefit from mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge. The declines in loan sales revenue reflected lower gain on sales margins as a result of increased competition in the marketplace and a shift in mix away from refinancing to purchases.The decline in other noninterest income in the year-to-date comparison was largely attributable to a $35 million decline in revenue from equity investments, which included the impact of first quarter 2017 positive valuation adjustments related to the Volcker Rule provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and net securities losses in the 2018 period compared with gains in the 2017 period, partially offset by a net $25 million benefit in the comparison from derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B common shares.In the first quarter of 2018, and in connection with the commercial and vendor finance business we acquired in the second quarter of 2017, we reclassified operating lease income to corporate services noninterest income from other noninterest income on the Consolidated Income Statement, including operating lease income of $34 million and $86 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Operating lease income was $32 million and $98 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively. Provision For Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased $42 million to $88 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 and decreased $56 million to $260 million for the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 reflecting a lower provision for commercial loans, partially offset by a higher provision for consumer loans. The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 7Noninterest ExpenseTable 4: Noninterest Expense  Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30       Change     Change Dollars in millions 20182017 $ % 2018 2017 $ % Noninterest expense                 Personnel $1,413 $1,286 $127 10 % $4,123 $3,819 $304 8 % Occupancy 195 204 (9) (4)% 616 628 (12) (2)% Equipment 264 259 5 2 % 818 791 27 3 % Marketing 71 62 9 15 % 201 184 17 9 % Other 665 645 20 3 % 1,961 1,915 46 2 % Total noninterest expense $2,608$2,456$152 6 % $7,719 $7,337 $382 5 %  Noninterest expense increased in both comparisons attributable to our ongoing business investments, including technology and staffing. The increases in personnel expense included higher variable compensation related to revenue growth, our announced increase in the minimum hourly pay rate for eligible employees and enhanced employee benefits. Marketing expense was higher in support of business growth. In addition, the year-to-date comparison reflects operating expense related to the second quarter 2017 acquisition of a commercial and vendor finance business.PNC continued to focus on disciplined expense management. As of September 30, 2018, we were on track to achieve our full-year 2018 goal of $250 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, which we expect will continue to help fund a portion of our strategic investments.Effective Income Tax RateThe effective income tax rate was 15.7% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 26.8% in the third quarter of 2017 and 17.0% in the first nine months of 2018 compared to 25.3% in the same period of 2017. Both comparisons reflected the change in the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective as of January 1, 2018, as a result of the new federal tax legislation.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEWTable 5: Summarized Balance Sheet Data  September 30 December 31 Change Dollars in millions2018 2017 $% Assets       Interest-earning deposits with banks$19,800 $28,595 $(8,795)(31)% Loans held for sale1,108 2,655 (1,547)(58)% Investment securities80,804 76,131 4,6736 % Loans223,053 220,458 2,5951 % Allowance for loan and lease losses(2,584) (2,611) 271 % Mortgage servicing rights2,136 1,832 30417 % Goodwill9,218 9,173 45— Other, net46,545 44,535 2,0105 % Total assets$380,080 $380,768 $(688)— Liabilities     Deposits$264,884 $265,053 $(169)— Borrowed funds57,955 59,088 (1,133)(2)% Other10,139 9,042 1,09712 % Total liabilities332,978 333,183 (205)— Equity     Total shareholders’ equity47,058 47,513 (455)(1)% Noncontrolling interests44 72 (28)(39)% Total equity47,102 47,585 (483)(1)% Total liabilities and equity$380,080 $380,768 $(688)— The summarized balance sheet data in Table 5 is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Part 1, Item 1 of this Report.8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QOur balance sheet was strong and well positioned at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.•Total assets were relatively stable as higher investment securities and loan growth were funded by lower interest-earning deposits with banks;•Total liabilities were stable, as lower borrowed funds were mostly offset by an increase in other liabilities;•Total equity decreased slightly as higher retained earnings driven by net income was more than offset by share repurchases and lower accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to net unrealized securities losses.The following discussion provides additional information about the major components of our balance sheet.

In Business Credit, higher utilization and new production resulted in an increase in commercial loans of $1.4 billion, or 8%. In Corporate Banking, commercial loans increased $.7 billion, or 1%, largely due to strong growth in asset-backed finance securitizations, partially offset by lower public finance lending. In the third quarter of 2018, commercial loan growth was moderated by payoffs and paydowns and lower line of credit utilization.For commercial loans by industry and commercial real estate loans by geography, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review.Consumer lending balances increased as growth in automobile and residential real estate loans were partially offset by lower home equity and education loans.The growth in automobile loans was due in part to continued expansion in the Southeast and new markets. Residential real estate loans increased as a result of originations of loans that are nonconforming, both nationwide and within our branch network. Nonconforming residential mortgage loans are loans that do not meet government agency standards, such as a maximum loan amount, property type or credit requirements, among other factors. Home equity loans declined as paydowns and payoffs exceeded new originated volume. In addition, the declines in both home equity and education loans included the continued runoff in our non-strategic brokered home equity and government guaranteed education loan portfolios.For information on home equity and residential real estate loans, including by geography, and automobile loans, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review.See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review, Note 3 Asset Quality and Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, and Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our loan portfolio.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 9Investment SecuritiesTable 7: Investment Securities  September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Ratings (a) as of September 30, 2018 Dollars in millionsAmortizedCost FairValue AmortizedCost FairValue AAA/AA A BBB BBandLower NoRating U.S. Treasury and government agencies$17,808 $17,586 $15,173 $15,286 100%     Agency residential mortgage-backed44,656 43,297 40,037 39,847 100%     Non-agency residential mortgage-backed2,189 2,507 2,610 2,932 12%  3% 65% 20% Agency commercial mortgage-backed2,214 2,128 2,367 2,315 100%     Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed (b)3,063 3,040 3,141 3,161 86% 6%   8% Asset-backed (c)5,732 5,779 5,531 5,598 86% 3% 4% 7%  Other debt (d)5,838 5,895 6,279 6,459 74% 16% 7%   3% Other (e)    587 585           Total investment securities (f)$81,500 $80,232 $75,725 $76,183 94% 2% 1% 2% 1% (a)Ratings percentages allocated based on amortized cost.(b)Collateralized primarily by retail properties, office buildings, lodging properties and multi-family housing.(c)Collateralized primarily by corporate debt, government guaranteed education loans and other consumer credit products.(d)Includes state and municipal securities.(e)On January 1, 2018, $.6 billion of available for sale securities, primarily money market funds, were reclassified to equity investments in accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01.

These increases were partially offset by the reclassification of $.6 billion of available for sale securities, primarily money market funds, to equity investments as part of the adoption of ASU 2016-01. See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies in our First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q for additional detail on the adoption of this ASU.The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan and deposit growth, and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.Table 7 presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio by credit rating. We have included credit ratings information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio.At least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on all securities. If economic conditions, including home prices, were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and liquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio would likely be adversely affected and we could incur additional other than temporary impairment (OTTI) credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement. The duration of investment securities was 3.6 years at September 30, 2018. We estimate that at September 30, 2018 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.7 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 3.5 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio (excluding other) was 5.6 years at September 30, 2018 compared to 5.2 years at December 31, 2017.10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 8: Weighted-Average Expected Maturities of Mortgage and Other Asset-Backed Debt Securities September 30, 2018Years Agency residential mortgage-backed6.8 Non-agency residential mortgage-backed6.5 Agency commercial mortgage-backed3.7 Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed2.7 Asset-backed2.3 Additional information regarding our investment securities is included in Note 5 Investment Securities and Note 6 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.Funding SourcesTable 9: Details of Funding Sources  September 30 December 31 Change Dollars in millions2018 2017 $% Deposits       Noninterest-bearing$74,736 $79,864 $(5,128)(6)% Interest-bearing     Money market55,662 59,735 (4,073)(7)% Demand62,354 61,213 1,1412 % Savings53,678 46,980 6,69814 % Time deposits18,454 17,261 1,1937 % Total interest-bearing deposits190,148 185,189 4,9593 % Total deposits264,884 265,053 (169)— Borrowed funds     Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings20,036 21,037 (1,001)(5)% Bank notes and senior debt26,676 28,062 (1,386)(5)% Subordinated debt5,764 5,200 56411 % Other5,479 4,789 69014 % Total borrowed funds57,955 59,088 (1,133)(2)% Total funding sources$322,839 $324,141 $(1,302)— Total deposits declined slightly in the comparison as growth in interest-bearing deposits was more than offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased mainly due to the impact of rising interest rates, reflecting a shift of primarily commercial noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing. The increase in interest-bearing deposits also was driven by growth in savings deposits reflecting, in part, a shift from consumer money market to relationship-based savings products. Borrowed funds decreased in the comparison as declines in bank notes and senior debt and FHLB borrowings were partially offset by increases in repurchase agreements and subordinated debt. The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan, investment securities and deposit growth, and capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our 2018 liquidity and capital activities.Shareholders’ EquityTotal shareholders’ equity was $47.1 billion at September 30, 2018, a decrease of $.5 billion compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease resulted from common share repurchases of $2.0 billion, common and preferred dividends of $1.3 billion and lower AOCI related to net unrealized securities losses of $1.1 billion, partially offset by net income of $4.0 billion. Common shares outstanding were 462 million and 473 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, as repurchases of 13.8 million shares during the period were partially offset by stock-based compensation activity and share issuances from treasury stock related to warrants exercised.

The increase in earnings was driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Earnings in 2018 also benefited from the lower statutory federal income tax rate.Net interest income increased primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.The increase in noninterest income was driven by growth in consumer service fees, including higher debit and credit card fees, as well as higher brokerage fees and service charges on deposits. In addition, the increase reflected a net $25 million benefit in the comparison from derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B common shares. These increases were partially offset by lower residential mortgage noninterest income, reflecting a decline in loan sales revenue, as well as lower servicing revenue and a lower benefit from mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge. The decline in loan sales revenue reflected lower gain on sales margins, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace and a shift in mix away from refinancing to purchases.Provision for credit losses increased in the comparison primarily due to credit card loan portfolio growth.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 13Higher noninterest expense primarily resulted from an increase in personnel expense, continued investments in technology, risk and compliance expense, and marketing activity.Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for consumers and small businesses. We are focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products.The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market-specific deposit growth strategies and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. During the first nine months of 2018, average total deposits increased compared to the same period a year ago, as both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased. Savings deposits grew, reflecting, in part, a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products. Certificates of deposit declined due to the net runoff of maturing accounts.Retail Banking average total loans increased in the first nine months of 2018 compared with the same period in 2017.•Average residential mortgages increased as a result of growth in nonconforming residential mortgage loans, both nationwide and within our branch network.•Average automobile loans, which consisted of both direct and indirect auto loans, increased primarily due to strong new loan volumes, including in our Southeast and new markets. •Average credit card balances increased as we continued to focus on our long-term objective of deepening penetration within our existing customer base.•Average home equity loans decreased as paydowns and payoffs on loans exceeded new originated volume.•Average education loans decreased driven by a decline in the runoff portfolio of government guaranteed education loans.•Average commercial and commercial real estate loans declined as paydowns and payoffs on loans exceeded new volume.Retail Banking continued to focus on its strategy of transforming the customer experience through transaction migration, branch network and home lending transformations and multi-channel engagement and service strategies.•Approximately 65% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions in the first nine months of 2018 compared with 61% in the first nine months of 2017.•Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 54% of total deposit transactions versus 53% in the comparison.•Instant debit card issuance, which enables us to print a customer’s debit card in minutes, was available in 92% of our branch network as of September 30, 2018. Retail Banking continued to make progress on its multi-year initiative to redesign the home lending process by integrating mortgage and home equity lending into a common platform to enhance product capability and improve speed of delivery and convenience. We implemented a new mortgage origination system in 2017 and converted home equity loans to the new servicing platform in the first quarter of 2018. Both residential mortgage and home equity loans are now serviced on a single platform.In the third quarter of 2018, Retail Banking launched its national retail digital strategy in select markets where it does not have existing branches, leading with a high yield savings offer to be supported by an ultra-thin retail network. With an initial focus on certain markets where PNC's Corporate & Institutional Banking has expanded its middle market banking business, PNC opened a retail location in Kansas City in October 2018.14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QCorporate & Institutional Banking(Unaudited)Table 11: Corporate & Institutional Banking TableNine months ended September 30    Change Dollars in millions2018 2017 $% Income Statement       Net interest income$2,707 $2,653 $542 % Noninterest income1,774 1,667 1076 % Total revenue4,481 4,320 1614 % Provision for credit losses43 174 (131)(75)% Noninterest expense1,934 1,785 1498 % Pretax earnings2,504 2,361 1436 % Income taxes580 834 (254)(30)% Earnings$1,924 $1,527 $39726 % Average Balance Sheet       Loans held for sale$763 $916 $(153)(17)% Loans       Commercial$102,342 $95,660 $6,6827 % Commercial real estate26,699 27,410 (711)(3)% Equipment lease financing7,512 7,602 (90)(1)% Total commercial lending136,553 130,672 5,8815 % Consumer49 276 (227)(82)% Total loans$136,602 $130,948 $5,6544 % Total assets$153,149 $147,299 $5,8504 % Deposits       Noninterest-bearing demand$44,577 $46,976 $(2,399)(5)% Money market23,511 21,949 1,5627 % Other19,182 16,100 3,08219 % Total deposits$87,270 $85,025 $2,2453 % Performance Ratios       Return on average assets1.68% 1.39%    Noninterest income to total revenue40% 39%    Efficiency43% 41%    Other Information       Consolidated revenue from: (a)       Treasury Management (b)$1,318 $1,115 $20318 % Capital Markets (b)$816 $746 $709 % Commercial mortgage banking activities       Commercial mortgage loans held for sale (c)$78 $73 $57 % Commercial mortgage loan servicing income (d)179 169 106 % Commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge (e)26 41 (15)(37)% Total$283 $283 $—— MSR asset value (f)$766 $628 $13822 % Average Loans by C&IB business       Corporate Banking$58,322 $55,242 $3,0806 % Real Estate37,379 37,995 (616)(2)% Business Credit17,234 15,531 1,70311 % Equipment Finance14,414 13,239 1,1759 % Commercial Banking7,032 7,052 (20)— Other2,221 1,889 33218 % Total average loans$136,602 $130,948 $5,6544 % Credit-related statistics       Nonperforming assets (f) (g)$355 $549 $(194)(35)% Net charge-offs$8 $64 $(56)(88)% (continued on following page)The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 15(continued from previous page)(a)Represents consolidated amounts.

The increase was primarily due to the impact of the lower statutory federal income tax rate, higher revenue and a decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. We continue to focus on building client relationships where the risk-return profile is attractive.Net interest income increased in the comparison, reflecting higher average loan and deposit balances, as well as wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans.Growth in noninterest income in the comparison was primarily driven by higher capital markets-related revenue, including higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and revenue from customer-related derivative and foreign exchange services, as well as higher treasury management fees, partially offset by a lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge. In addition, operating lease income increased, mainly due to the commercial and vendor finance business acquired in the second quarter of 2017. Overall, credit quality remained strong, as nonperforming assets and net charge-offs declined in the comparison. The decrease in provision for credit losses in the comparison reflected improved credit quality. Additionally, the prior year period included an initial provision for the loan and lease portfolio obtained through the business acquired in the second quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense increased in the comparison largely due to investments in strategic initiatives and variable costs associated with increased business activity. Average loans increased in the comparison mostly due to strong growth in the Corporate Banking, Business Credit and Equipment Finance businesses:•Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business grew in the comparison reflecting increased lending to large and mid-sized corporate clients as well as strong production in asset-backed financing, partially offset by lower public finance lending.•PNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average loans for this business decreased primarily driven by project loan payoffs and lower utilization. •PNC Business Credit provides asset-based lending. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets. Average loans for this business increased in the comparison as increased utilization and new originations were partially offset by payoffs.•PNC Equipment Finance provides equipment financing solutions for clients throughout the U.S. and Canada. Average loans, including commercial loans and finance leases, and operating leases were $15.4 billion in the first nine months of 2018, an increase of $1.3 billion in the year over year comparison due to strong new production and the impact of the acquired business.•Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business were relatively unchanged. The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits increased in the comparison driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits reflecting, in part, a shift from noninterest-bearing deposits in the rising rate environment. We continue to monitor and balance the relationship between increases to rates paid and the overall profitability of our deposit balances.Corporate & Institutional Banking is expanding its Corporate Banking business, focused on the middle market and larger sectors, into the Denver, Houston and Nashville markets in 2018, and the Boston and Phoenix markets in 2019. This follows offices opened in 2017 in Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis. These locations complement Corporate & Institutional Banking national businesses with a significant presence in these cities, and build on past successes in the markets where PNC’s retail banking presence was limited, such as in the Southeast. We plan to offer our full suite of products and services. 16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QProduct RevenueIn addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 11 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.Treasury management revenue comprises fees from products and services and net interest income from customer deposit balances. Compared with the first nine months of 2017, treasury management revenue increased due to liquidity-related revenue associated with customer deposit balances, including interest rate spread expansion, and higher fee income.Capital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities underwriting, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets advisory related services. The increase in revenue in the comparison was broad based across most products and services and included higher merger and acquisition advisory, foreign exchange, derivative and equity capital markets advisory related services, partially offset by lower revenue from credit valuations on customer-related derivative activities.Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities was stable in the comparison as higher revenue from commercial mortgage loan servicing and commercial mortgage loans held for sale was offset by a lower benefit from commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 17Asset Management Group(Unaudited)Table 12: Asset Management Group Table Nine months ended September 30    Change Dollars in millions, except as noted2018 2017 $% Income Statement       Net interest income$217 $216 $1— Noninterest income676 655 213 % Total revenue893 871 223 % Provision for credit losses (benefit)2 (6) 8* Noninterest expense658 646 122 % Pretax earnings233 231 21 % Income taxes55 85 (30)(35)% Earnings$178 $146 $3222 % Average Balance Sheet       Loans       Consumer$4,702 $5,059 $(357)(7)% Commercial and commercial real estate734 705 294 % Residential mortgage1,561 1,257 30424 % Total loans$6,997 $7,021 $(24)— Total assets$7,455 $7,499 $(44)(1)% Deposits       Noninterest-bearing demand$1,455 $1,501 $(46)(3)% Interest-bearing demand3,413 3,666 (253)(7)% Money market2,339 3,257 (918)(28)% Savings4,754 3,834 92024 % Other408 237 17172 % Total deposits$12,369 $12,495 $(126)(1)% Performance Ratios       Return on average assets3.19% 2.60%    Noninterest income to total revenue76% 75%    Efficiency74% 74%    Supplemental Noninterest Income Information       Asset management fees$669 $644 $254 % Other Information       Nonperforming assets (a) (b)$51 $45 $613 % Net charge-offs$8 $5 $360 % Client Assets Under Administration (in billions) (a) (c)       Discretionary client assets under management$159 $146 $139 % Nondiscretionary client assets under administration134 129 54 % Total$293 $275 $187 % Discretionary client assets under management       Personal$97 $90 $78 % Institutional62 56 611 % Total$159 $146 $139 % * - Not meaningful(a)As of September 30.(b)Includes nonperforming loans of $48 million at September 30, 2018 and $41 million at September 30, 2017.(c)Excludes brokerage account client assets. Asset Management Group earned $178 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to $146 million for the same period in 2017. Higher earnings reflected the lower statutory federal income tax rate and higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and the impact of a benefit from the provision for credit losses in the prior year period.Higher revenue in the comparison was driven by growth in asset management fees, reflecting stronger average equity markets.18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QNoninterest expense increased in the comparison and was primarily attributable to higher legal reserves, continued investments in technology and higher compensation. Asset Management Group’s discretionary client assets under management increased in the comparison to the prior year, primarily attributable to higher equity markets as of September 30, 2018. The Asset Management Group strives to be the leading relationship-based provider of investment, planning, banking and fiduciary services to wealthy individuals and institutions by proactively delivering value-added ideas and solutions and exceptional service.Wealth Management and Hawthorn have nearly 100 offices operating in seven out of the ten most affluent states in the U.S. with a majority co-located with retail banking branches.

Additionally, our 2017 Form 10-K provides an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, liquidity and capital, market, operational and compliance. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section.The following information updates our 2017 Form 10-K risk management disclosures.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 19Credit Risk Management See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding credit risk.Loan Portfolio Characteristics and AnalysisTable 14: Details of Loans In billionsWe use several asset quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 3 Asset Quality, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about our significant loan classes.CommercialCommercial loans comprised 51% and 50% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Most of our commercial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, real estate and other business assets. We actively manage our commercial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign an internal risk rating reflecting the borrower’s probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD). This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to continual monitoring of the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geography that may exist in our portfolio. Our portfolio remains stable and well-diversified as shown in the following table which provides a breakout of our commercial loans by industry classification (classified based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)).Table 15: Commercial Loans by Industry  September 30, 2018  December 31, 2017 Dollars in millionsAmount % of Total  Amount % of Total Commercial         Manufacturing$21,272 19%  $20,578 19% Retail/wholesale trade19,689 17  17,846 16 Service providers14,386 13  15,100 14 Real estate related (a)12,539 11  12,496 11 Health care9,217 8  9,739 9 Financial services9,441 8  8,532 8 Transportation and warehousing5,715 5  5,609 5 Other industries21,412 19  20,627 18 Total commercial loans$113,671 100%  $110,527 100% (a) Includes loans to customers in the real estate and construction industries.20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QCommercial Real EstateCommercial real estate loans comprised $14.5 billion of real estate project loans and $14.1 billion related to commercial mortgages as of September 30, 2018. Comparable amounts were $15.3 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. Commercial real estate loan growth remains challenged as market pricing and structure is, at times, outside of our risk tolerance, and payoffs and maturities continue at a steady pace. We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate projects and commercial mortgages similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with types of credit activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S. The following table presents our commercial real estate loans by geographic market.

Comparable amounts were $16.8 billion and $11.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. We track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original loan-to-value ratios (LTV), updated FICO scores at least quarterly, updated LTVs at least semi-annually, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management, we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.The portfolio is primarily originated within our primary geographic markets, with only 5% of the portfolio in states outside of those markets at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The credit quality of newly originated loans over the last twelve months was strong overall as evidenced by a weighted-average LTV on originations of 67% and a weighted-average FICO score of 774.The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position, but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally based upon original LTV at the time of origination. We use a third-party service provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 21The following table presents our home equity loans by geographic market and lien type.Table 17: Home Equity Loans by Geography and by Lien Priority September 30, 2018  December 31, 2017 Dollars in millionsAmount % of Total  Amount % of Total Geography          Pennsylvania$6,303 24%  $6,792 24%  New Jersey4,017 15  4,252 15  Ohio3,161 12  3,413 12  Illinois1,678 6  1,801 6  Maryland1,498 6  1,572 6  Michigan1,372 5  1,442 5  Florida1,223 5  1,255 4  North Carolina1,184 4  1,266 5  Kentucky1,063 4  1,138 4  Indiana860 3  924 3 All other states4,269 16  4,509 16 Total home equity loans$26,628 100%  $28,364 100% Lien type         1st lien  58%    58% 2nd lien  42    42 Total  100%    100% Residential Real Estate Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We track borrower performance of this portfolio monthly similar to home equity loans. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management, we also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g., nonconforming, conforming, etc.). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations. Loan performance is evaluated by source originators and loan servicers.The credit quality of newly originated loans that we retained on our balance sheet over the last twelve months was strong overall as evidenced by a weighted-average LTV on originations of 71% and a weighted-average FICO score of 769. The following table presents our residential real estate loans by geographic market.Table 18: Residential Real Estate Loans by Geography  September 30, 2018  December 31, 2017 Dollars in millionsAmount % of Total  Amount % of Total Geography          California$4,393 24%  $3,676 21%  New Jersey1,607 9  1,503 9  Florida1,534 8  1,529 9  Illinois1,167 6  1,230 7  Pennsylvania1,011 5  962 5  New York923 5  847 5  Maryland901 5  902 5  North Carolina841 5  821 5  Virginia824 5  824 5  Ohio676 4  684 4 All other states4,326 24  4,234 25 Total residential real estate loans$18,203 100%  $17,212 100% 22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QWe originate residential mortgage loans nationwide through our national mortgage business as well as within our branch network. Residential mortgage loans underwritten to government agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold with servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet government agency standards, which we retain on our balance sheet. Growth in residential mortgage loans in the first nine months of 2018 was primarily due to nonconforming loans that exceeded agency conforming loan limits. The nonconforming residential mortgage portfolio had strong credit quality at September 30, 2018 with an average original LTV of 70% and an average original FICO score of 772. Our portfolio of nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $12.2 billion at September 30, 2018, with 29% located in California. AutomobileWithin auto loans, $12.8 billion resided in the indirect auto portfolio while $1.5 billion were in the direct auto portfolio as of September 30, 2018. Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2017 were $11.4 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, and also included $.1 billion of securitized loans. The indirect auto portfolio relates to loan applications generated from franchised automobile dealers. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail business.We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by a weighted-average loan origination FICO score over the last twelve months of 739 for indirect auto loans and 762 for direct auto loans. The weighted-average term of loan originations over the last twelve months was 74 months for indirect auto loans and 62 months for direct auto loans. We offer both new and used automobile financing to customers through our various channels. At September 30, 2018, the portfolio was composed of 53% new vehicle loans and 47% used vehicle loans. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2017 were 54% and 46%, respectively.The auto loan portfolio's performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by loan structure, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and term.Nonperforming Assets and Loan DelinquenciesNonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), other real estate owned (OREO), foreclosed and other assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2017 Form 10-K. A summary of the major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in Table 19. See Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further detail of nonperforming asset categories.Table 19: Nonperforming Assets by Type  September 30, 2018December 31, 2017 ChangeDollars in millions$ %Nonperforming loans      Commercial lending$393$554 $(161) (29)%Consumer lending (a)1,3011,311 (10) (1)%Total nonperforming loans1,6941,865 (171) (9)%OREO, foreclosed and other assets131170 (39) (23)%Total nonperforming assets$1,825$2,035 $(210) (10)%Amount of TDRs included in nonperforming loans$878$964 $(86) (9)%Percentage of total nonperforming loans52%52%    Nonperforming loans to total loans.76%.85%    Nonperforming assets to total loans, OREO, foreclosed and other assets.82%.92%    Nonperforming assets to total assets.48%.53%    Allowance for loan and lease losses to total nonperforming loans153%140%    (a)Excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 23Table 20: Change in Nonperforming Assets In millions 2018 2017 January 1 $2,035 $2,374 New nonperforming assets 785 1,069 Charge-offs and valuation adjustments (408) (444) Principal activity, including paydowns and payoffs (379) (551) Asset sales and transfers to loans held for sale (101) (138) Returned to performing status (107) (243) September 30 $1,825 $2,067 As of September 30, 2018, approximately 89% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses in the event of default. As of September 30, 2018, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 66% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the Allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprised 77% and 75% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Home equity TDRs comprised 48% of home equity nonperforming loans at September 30, 2018, down from 50% at December 31, 2017. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.At September 30, 2018, our largest nonperforming asset was $37 million in the Information industry and the ten largest individual nonperforming assets represented 10% of total nonperforming assets.Loan DelinquenciesWe regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 21: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)   Amount    Percentage of Total Loans Outstanding   September 302018 December 312017 Change September 302018 December 312017 Dollars in millions $ %  Early stage loan delinquencies             Accruing loans past due 30 to 59 days $551 $545 $6 1 % .25% .25% Accruing loans past due 60 to 89 days 258 238 20 8 % .12% .11% Total 809 783 26 3 % .36% .36% Late stage loan delinquencies             Accruing loans past due 90 days or more 619 737 (118) (16)% .28% .33% Total $1,428 $1,520 $(92) (6)% .64% .69% (a)Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed loans of $.7 billion at September 30, 2018 and $.9 billion at December 31, 2017.Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed loans.Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt RestructuringsConsumer Loan ModificationsWe modify loans under government and PNC-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. Loans that 24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Qare either temporarily or permanently modified under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as TDRs. Further, loans that have certain types of payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs.A temporary modification, with a term up to 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. Permanent modification programs generally result in principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, capitalization of past due amounts, interest-only period or deferral of principal.We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our borrowers’ and servicing customers’ needs while mitigating credit losses. Table 22 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as of each date presented.Table 22: Consumer Real Estate Related Loan Modifications   September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Dollars in millions Number ofAccounts UnpaidPrincipalBalance Number ofAccounts UnpaidPrincipalBalance Temporary modifications 2,629 $178 3,033 $217 Permanent modifications 21,567 2,382 23,270 2,581 Total consumer real estate related loan modifications 24,196 $2,560 26,303 $2,798 Commercial Loan ModificationsModifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.Troubled Debt RestructuringsA TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court imposed concessions (e.g., a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan).Table 23: Summary of Troubled Debt Restructurings (a)  September 302018 December 312017 Change Dollars in millions $ % Total commercial lending $389 $409 $(20) (5)% Total consumer lending 1,497 1,652 (155) (9)% Total TDRs $1,886 $2,061 $(175) (8)% Nonperforming $878 $964 $(86) (9)% Accruing (b) 1,008 1,097 (89) (8)% Total TDRs $1,886 $2,061 $(175) (8)% (a)Amounts in table represent recorded investment, which includes the unpaid principal balance plus net accounting adjustments, less any charge-offs. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.(b)Accruing loans include consumer credit card loans and loans that have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans.Excluded from TDRs are $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion of consumer loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain government insured or guaranteed loans at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Nonperforming TDRs represented approximately 52% of total nonperforming loans and 47% of total TDRs at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual accounting after performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 25Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of CreditWe maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. Our total ALLL of $2.6 billion at September 30, 2018 consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes are periodically updated.Allowances are established for non-impaired commercial loan classes based primarily on PD and LGD.Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which generally demonstrate lower LGD compared to loans not secured by collateral. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our PDs and LGDs as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment.Allowances for non-impaired consumer loan classes are primarily based upon transition matrices, including using a roll-rate model. The roll-rate model uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off.We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:•Industry concentrations and conditions,•Recent credit quality trends,•Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,•Recent macro-economic factors,•Model imprecision,•Changes in lending policies and procedures,•Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and•Limitations of available historical data.Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carryover or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. At September 30, 2018, we had established reserves of $.3 billion for purchased impaired loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition.In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our ALLL.See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2017 Form 10-K and Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish the allowances.26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 24: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Dollars in millions 2018 2017 January 1 $2,611 $2,589 Total net charge-offs (313) (334) Provision for credit losses 260 316 Net decrease / (increase) in allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 9 8 Other 17 26 September 30 $2,584 $2,605 Net charge-offs to average loans (for the nine months ended) (annualized) .19% .21% Total allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans 1.16% 1.18% Commercial lending net charge-offs $(18) $(69) Consumer lending net charge-offs (295) (265) Total net charge-offs $(313) $(334) Net charge-offs to average loans (for the nine months ended) (annualized)     Commercial lending .02% .06% Consumer lending .54% .49% At September 30, 2018, total ALLL to total nonperforming loans was 153%. The comparable amount for December 31, 2017 was 140%. These ratios are 110% and 102% when excluding the $.7 billion of ALLL at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. We have excluded these amounts from ALLL in these ratios as these asset classes are not included in nonperforming loans. See Table 19 within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information.The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. During the first nine months of 2018, overall credit quality remained strong, which resulted in an essentially flat ALLL balance as of September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017.The following table summarizes our loan charge-offs and recoveries.Table 25: Loan Charge-Offs and Recoveries Nine months ended September 30 GrossCharge-offs Recoveries Net Charge-offs /(Recoveries) Percent of AverageLoans (Annualized) Dollars in millions2018         Commercial $78 $50 $28 .03 % Commercial real estate 8 18 (10) (.05)% Equipment lease financing 6 6    Home equity 85 67 18 .09 % Residential real estate 9 18 (9) (.07)% Credit card 161 18 143 3.32 % Other consumer         Automobile 117 56 61 .60 %  Education 24 6 18 .57 %  Other 76 12 64 1.94 %  Total $564 $251 $313 .19 % 2017         Commercial $140 $61 $79 .10 % Commercial real estate 9 21 (12) (.05)% Equipment lease financing 6 4 2 .04 % Home equity 98 67 31 .14 % Residential real estate 8 12 (4) (.03)% Credit card 136 16 120 3.09 % Other consumer         Automobile 89 43 46 .49 %  Education 23 6 17 .46 %  Other 68 13 55 1.65 %  Total $577 $243 $334 .21 % The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 27See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2017 Form 10-K and Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on the ALLL.Liquidity and Capital Management Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management section of our 2017 Form 10-K.One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by dividing the amount of an institution’s high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA), as defined and calculated in accordance with the LCR rules, by its estimated net cash outflows, with net cash outflows determined by applying the assumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The resulting quotient is expressed as a percentage. The minimum LCR that PNC and PNC Bank are required to maintain is 100% in 2018. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily, and as of September 30, 2018, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the requirement of 100%.We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2017 Form 10-K.Sources of LiquidityOur largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits declined slightly to $264.9 billion at September 30, 2018 from $265.1 billion at December 31, 2017 as growth in interest-bearing deposits was more than offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review for additional information related to our deposits. Additionally, certain assets determined by us to be liquid as well as unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity position.At September 30, 2018, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $24.5 billion and securities available for sale totaling $61.2 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities. Our liquid assets included $3.1 billion of securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $6.0 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings). See Note 10 Borrowed Funds in our 2017 Form 10-K and the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review for additional information related to our borrowings.Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, decreased due to the following activity:Table 26: Senior and Subordinated Debt In billions2018 January 1$33.3 Issuances4.5 Calls and maturities(4.8) Other(.6) September 30$32.4 Bank LiquidityUnder PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At September 30, 2018, PNC Bank had $26.5 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $22.2 billion were senior bank notes and $4.3 billion were subordinated bank notes. The following table details issuances for the three months ended September 30, 2018.28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 27: PNC Bank Notes Issued Issuance DateAmountDescription of IssuanceJuly 26, 2018September 14, 2018 (re-opening)$750 million$500 millionSubordinated notes with a maturity date of July 26, 2028. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 4.05% on January 26 and July 26 of each year, beginning January 26, 2019. Following the re-opening, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of this series of notes increased to $1.25 billion.PNC Bank maintains additional secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh and through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At September 30, 2018, our unused secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $42.1 billion.PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2018, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.Parent Company LiquidityIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions.As of September 30, 2018, available parent company liquidity totaled $4.7 billion. Parent company liquidity is primarily held in intercompany short-term investments, the terms of which provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:•Bank-level capital needs,•Laws and regulations,•Corporate policies,•Contractual restrictions, and•Other factors.There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $3.0 billion at September 30, 2018. See Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2017 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these limitations.In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. The parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2018, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding.The parent company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, equity and other capital instruments. Under this shelf registration statement, on September 5, 2018, the parent company issued $500 million in Senior Notes with a maturity date of September 3, 2021. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.25% per annum on March 3 and September 3 of each year, beginning March 3, 2019.Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsWe have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2017 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on our commitments in Note 13 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29Credit RatingsPNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain products.In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.Table 28: Credit Ratings for PNC and PNC Bank  September 30, 2018  Moody’sStandard & Poor’sFitchPNC   Senior debtA3A-A+Subordinated debtA3BBB+APreferred stockBaa2BBB-BBB-PNC Bank   Senior debtA2AA+Subordinated debtA3A-ALong-term depositsAa2AAA-Short-term depositsP-1A-1F1+Short-term notesP-1A-1F1Capital ManagementDetailed information on our capital management processes and activities, including additional information on our previous CCAR submissions and capital plans, is included in the Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2017 Form 10-K.We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.In connection with the 2018 CCAR process, we submitted our capital plan, as approved by PNC's Board of Directors, to the Federal Reserve in April 2018. In June 2018, the Federal Reserve accepted the capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions. As provided in the 2018 capital plan, we announced new share repurchase programs of up to $2.0 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the third quarter of 2018, including repurchases of up to $.3 billion related to employee benefit plans. In the third quarter of 2018, we repurchased 3.3 million common shares for $.5 billion.We paid dividends on common stock of $.4 billion, or $.95 per common share, during the third quarter of 2018. On October 4, 2018, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $.95 per share with a payment date of November 5, 2018.We completed our common stock repurchase programs for the four quarter period that ended June 30, 2018 with total repurchases of 18.4 million common shares for $2.6 billion. These repurchases were included in our capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve as part of our 2017 CCAR submission. Additionally, we paid $1.5 billion in common stock dividends for a total of $4.1 billion of capital returned to shareholders during this four quarter period. 30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 29: Basel III CapitalDollars in millionsBasel III September 30, 2018 (a) (b)Fully Phased-In Basel III (Non-GAAP) December 31, 2017 (c)2017 Transitional Basel IIIDecember 31, 2017 (a)Common equity Tier 1 capital    Common stock plus related surplus, net of treasury stock$6,256$8,195 $8,195Retained earnings38,08035,481 35,481Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for securities currently, and those transferred from, available for sale(519)337 270Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for pension and other postretirement plans(488)(544) (436)Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities(9,024)(8,988) (8,988)Other disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities(273)(319) (255)Other adjustments/(deductions)(322)(141) (138)Total common equity Tier 1 capital before threshold deductions33,71034,021 34,129Total threshold deductions (d)(3,932)(2,928) (1,983)Common equity Tier 1 capital29,77831,093 32,146Additional Tier 1 capital    Preferred stock plus related surplus3,9823,985 3,985Other adjustments/(deductions)(154)(146) (124)Tier 1 capital33,60634,932 36,007Additional Tier 2 capital    Qualifying subordinated debt4,0673,433 3,482Trust preferred capital securities80  100Eligible credit reserves includable in Tier 2 capital2,8732,907 2,907Total Basel III capital40,626$41,272 $42,496Risk-weighted assets    Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets (e)$318,889$316,120 $309,460Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets (f)$274,742$285,226 N/AAverage quarterly adjusted total assets$364,909$363,967 $364,999Supplementary leverage exposure (g)$437,406$434,698 $435,731Basel III risk-based capital and leverage ratios    Common equity Tier 1 (i)9.3%9.8%(h)10.4%Tier 1 (j)10.5%11.1%(h)11.6%Total (k) (l) (m) 12.7%13.1%(h)13.7%Leverage (n)9.2%9.6% 9.9%Supplementary leverage ratio (o)7.7%8.0% 8.3%(a)All ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during each period presented and calculated based on the standardized approach.(b)The Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, Leverage and Supplementary ratios as of September 30, 2018 reflect the full phase-in of all Basel III adjustments to these metrics applicable to PNC.(c)2017 Fully Phased-In Basel III results are presented as pro forma estimates.(d)Under the Basel III rules, certain items such as significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions (primarily BlackRock), mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a phase-in schedule that ended December 31, 2017 and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of PNC's adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital.(e)Includes credit and market risk-weighted assets.(f)Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are calculated based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market, and operational risk-weighted assets.

We anticipate additional refinements to this calculation through the parallel run qualification phase.(g)Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures including undrawn credit commitments and derivative potential future exposures.(h)Pro forma Fully phased-in Basel III capital ratios are based on Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets and rules.(i)For comparative purposes only, the advanced approaches Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio for September 30, 2018 is 10.8% and for December 31, 2017 is 10.9% (estimated). This capital ratio is calculated using Common equity Tier 1 capital and dividing by Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.(j)For comparative purposes only, the advanced approaches Basel III Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio for both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 (estimated) is 12.2%. This capital ratio is calculated using Tier 1 capital and dividing by Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.(k)For comparative purposes only, the advanced approaches Basel III Total risk-based capital ratio for September 30, 2018 is 13.8% and for December 31, 2017 is 13.5% (estimated). This ratio is calculated using Total Basel III capital, which under the advanced approaches, Additional Tier 2 capital includes allowance for loan and lease losses in excess of Basel expected credit losses, if any, up to 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets, and dividing by Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets.(l)The Basel III Total risk-based capital ratio includes $80 million of nonqualifying trust preferred capital securities that are subject to a phase-out period that runs through 2021.(m)For comparative purposes only, as of September 30, 2018 the ratio would be 12.7%, assuming nonqualifying trust preferred capital securities are phased out.(n)Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.(o)Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure. As advanced approaches banking organizations, PNC and PNC Bank became subject to a 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio effective January 1, 2018.The decline in our Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 reflected continued capital return to shareholders in the form of common share repurchases and dividends and a decline in AOCI largely related to the impact of higher interest rates on the valuation of our available for sale securities portfolio.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 31Because PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2018 and 2017 are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of exposures. Once we exit parallel run, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios will be the lower of the ratios calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.Under the Basel III rules applicable to PNC, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions (for PNC, primarily BlackRock), mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (subject to a phase-in schedule that ended December 31, 2017 and net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institution's adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel III regulatory capital includes (subject to a phase-in schedule that ended December 31, 2017) AOCI related to securities currently, and those transferred from, available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans. With the exception of certain nonqualifiying trust preferred capital securities included in PNC’s Total risk-based capital ratio, the transitions and multi-year phase-in of the definition of capital under the Basel III rules were complete as of January 1, 2018. Accordingly, we refer to the capital ratios calculated using the definition of capital in effect as of January 1, 2018 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as the Basel III ratios. The Basel III Total risk-based capital ratio includes trust preferred capital securities in the amount of $80 million that are subject to a phase-out that runs through 2021. We refer to the capital ratios calculated using the phased-in Basel III provisions in effect for 2017 and, for the risk-based ratios, standardized approach risk-weighted assets, as the 2017 Transitional Basel III ratios. All current period capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to us during 2018.Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our September 30, 2018 capital levels were aligned with them.At September 30, 2018, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 18 Regulatory Matters in our 2017 Form 10-K. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of this Report for details on our September 30, 2017 Transitional Basel III and Fully Phased-In Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratios.Market Risk ManagementMarket risk is the risk of a loss in earnings or economic value due to adverse movements in market factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk primarily by our involvement in the following activities, among others:•Traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans,•Equity and other investments and activities whose economic values are directly impacted by market factors, and•Fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities, as a result of customer activities and securities underwriting.We have established enterprise-wide policies and methodologies to identify, measure, monitor and report market risk. Market Risk Management provides independent oversight by monitoring compliance with established guidelines and reporting significant risks in the business to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.Market Risk Management – Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QThe interest rates that we pay on customer deposits have risen in recent quarters as a result of higher short-term market interest rates. The rates paid on commercial deposits have had a higher correlation to increases in short-term interest rates, as compared to the rates paid on consumer deposits. During the remainder of 2018, we anticipate that the rates paid on our consumer deposits will have a higher correlation to changes in short-term interest rates. The rates paid on customer deposits are also impacted by factors including the level of interest rates, competition for deposits, new product offerings, and changes in business strategies.Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.Sensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the third quarters of 2018 and 2017 follow:Table 30: Interest Sensitivity Analysis Third Quarter 2018 Third Quarter 2017 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation (a)    Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over the  following 12 months of:    100 basis point increase1.8 % 2.9 % 100 basis point decrease(2.3)% (3.6)% Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the  preceding 12 months of:    100 basis point increase3.6 % 5.9 % 100 basis point decrease(5.9)% (8.8)% Duration of Equity Model (a)    Base case duration of equity (in years).2 (2.6) Key Period-End Interest Rates    One-month LIBOR2.26 % 1.23 % Three-month LIBOR2.40 % 1.33 % Three-year swap3.05 % 1.86 % (a)Given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 31 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.Table 31: Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Alternative Rate Scenarios September 30, 2018  PNCEconomistMarketForwardSlopeFlattening First year sensitivity.5%.5 %(.6)% Second year sensitivity.3%(1.0)%(3.0)% When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 30 and 31. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates.The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33Table 32: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year Forward The third quarter 2018 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions.Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading RiskWe engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.We use value-at-risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for the first nine months of 2018 and 2017 were within our acceptable limits.See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2017 Form 10-K for more information on our models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process.Customer related trading revenue was $196 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to $186 million for the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher foreign exchange client sales revenues. For the quarterly period, customer related trading revenue was $53 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to $57 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in credit valuations for customer-related derivatives, which was partially offset by higher client related trading and foreign exchange client revenues. Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment RiskEquity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.A summary of our equity investments follows:Table 33: Equity Investments Summary  September 302018 December 312017 Change Dollars in millions $ % BlackRock$7,909 $7,576 $333 4% Tax credit investments2,233 2,148 85 4% Private equity and other2,304 1,668 636 38% Total$12,446 $11,392 $1,054 9% 34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QBlackRockWe owned approximately 35 million common stock equivalent shares of BlackRock equity at September 30, 2018, accounted for under the equity method. The Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review includes additional information about BlackRock.Tax Credit InvestmentsIncluded in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $.7 billion and $.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2017 Form 10-K has further information on Tax Credit Investments.Private Equity and OtherThe majority of our other equity investments consists of our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.3 billion at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. As of September 30, 2018, $1.1 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.2 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. See Item 1 Business - Supervision and Regulation in our 2017 Form 10-K for discussion of the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank on our interests in and of private funds covered by the Volcker Rule.Effective January 1, 2018, $.6 billion of available for sale securities were reclassified to equity investments as part of the adoption of ASU 2016-01. These securities were primarily money market funds.Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. At September 30, 2018, the estimated value of our investment in Visa Class B common shares was approximately $860 million while our cost basis was not significant. Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded class of stock, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending interchange litigation. We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were not significant at September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017.Financial DerivativesWe use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Substantially all such instruments are used to manage risk related to changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, swaptions, options, forwards and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for risk management. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Periodic cash payments are exchanged for interest rate swaps, options and futures contracts. Premiums are also exchanged for options contracts. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 6 Fair Value in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2017 Form 10-K and in Note 6 Fair Value and Note 9 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS Consistent with Section 403 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (Relief Act), on August 22, 2018, the Federal Reserve, Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) jointly issued an interim final rule to amend the LCR rules to expand the definition of high quality liquid assets under those rules to include certain high quality municipal securities. The interim final rule took effect on August 31, 2018.On September 5, 2018, the OCC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking soliciting public input on a framework for modernizing its regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The public comment period closes on November 19, 2018.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 35On September 18, 2018, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC jointly requested public comments on a proposal, consistent with Section 214 of the Relief Act, to implement changes under the U.S. Standardized Approach regulatory capital rules to limit the scope of commercial real estate exposures that receive a heightened (150 percent) risk weight. The public comment period on the proposal closes on November 27, 2018.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSNote 1 Accounting Policies of our 2017 Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.The following critical accounting policies and judgments are described in more detail in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in Item 7 of our 2017 Form 10-K:•Fair Value Measurements•Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit•Goodwill•Residential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights•Income Taxes•Legal ContingenciesFair Value MeasurementsThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and the portions of such assets and liabilities that are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 assets and liabilities are those where the fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs.Table 34: Fair Value Measurements – Summary September 30, 2018  December 31, 2017 Dollars in millionsTotal Fair Value Level 3  Total Fair Value Level 3 Total assets$72,958 $6,269  $69,673 $6,475 Total assets at fair value as a percentage of consolidated assets19%    18%   Level 3 assets as a percentage of total assets at fair value  9%    9% Level 3 assets as a percentage of consolidated assets  2%    2% Total liabilities$3,884 $406  $4,233 $531 Total liabilities at fair value as a percentage of consolidated liabilities1%    1%   Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities at fair value  10%    13% Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of consolidated liabilities  <1%    <1% The majority of assets recorded at fair value are included in the securities available for sale portfolio. The majority of Level 3 assets represent non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the available for sale portfolio, mortgage servicing rights and equity investments. For further information on fair value, see Note 6 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.Income TaxesSee the Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments section in Item 7 of our 2017 Form 10-K for information on our accounting of certain income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017. Where certain income tax effects could be reasonably estimated, these were included as provisional amounts as of December 31, 2017. During the measurement period, which will end in December 2018, these estimates may be adjusted upon obtaining or analyzing additional information about facts and circumstances or clarifications of uncertain aspects of the newly enacted tax law, which if known would have affected the initially reported provisional amounts. No changes were made to these provisional amounts during the first nine months of 2018.36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QRecently Issued Accounting StandardsAccounting Standards Update (ASU)DescriptionFinancial Statement ImpactLeases - ASU 2016-02Issued February 2016• Required effective date of January 1, 2019.(a)• Requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. • Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.• Targeted changes have been made to the lessor accounting model to align the guidance with the new lessee model and revenue recognition guidance. • May be adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment. • Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an ASU which permits the option to adopt the new standard prospectively as of the effective date, without adjusting comparative periods presented. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the effective date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption.• We plan to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of 2019, utilizing the new transition relief option.• Implementation efforts are ongoing, including the recent deployment of our lessee accounting software solution.• We continue to evaluate the impact of planned accounting policy elections and the new disclosure requirements. Our evaluation of the incremental borrowing rate to discount our future minimum lease payments in calculating the lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets is substantially complete.• Our evaluation of our initial lease population is substantially complete. We will continue to review service contracts through the effective date and may identify additional leases embedded within those arrangements that are within the scope of the ASU. • We expect, at a minimum, to recognize lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets commensurate with the present value of the future minimum payments. Future minimum lease payments under operating leases totaled $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 as disclosed in Note 8 Premises, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements in our 2017 Form 10-K.• We do not expect a material change to the timing of our expense recognition.• We have evaluated the changes to the lessor accounting model and do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our financial statements.Credit Losses - ASU 2016-13Issued June 2016• Required effective date of January 1, 2020.(a) • Requires the use of an expected credit loss methodology; specifically, current expected credit losses (CECL) for the remaining life of the asset will be recognized at the time of origination or acquisition. • Methodology will apply to loans, debt securities, and other financial assets and net investment in leases not accounted for at fair value through net income. It will also apply to off-balance sheet credit exposures except for unconditionally cancellable commitments. • In-scope assets will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the assets. • Requires enhanced credit quality disclosures including disaggregation of credit quality indicators by vintage. • Requires a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. • We do not plan to adopt the standard at its early adoption date in the first quarter of 2019.• We established a company-wide, cross-functional governance structure in the third quarter of 2016, which oversees overall strategy for implementation of Topic 326. • We continue to make progress towards design and development of CECL estimation methodologies, technological solutions, data requirements, revised disclosures, committee reporting and future state processes.• We plan to review and validate loss model outputs, test end to end processes, and assess controls and future state governance structure during 2019. We continue to meet with industry groups, regulatory bodies and our external auditors regularly to discuss implementation related topics.• We continue to believe that the adoption of the standard will result in an overall increase in the allowance for loan losses to cover credit losses over the estimated life of the financial assets. However, the magnitude of the increase in our allowance for loan losses at the adoption date will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the portfolio at the adoption date, as well as macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date.Goodwill - ASU 2017-04Issued January 2017• Required effective date of January 1, 2020.(a)• Eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill under which a loss was recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value.• Requires impairment to be recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.• We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date and we do not expect the adoption of this standard to impact our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position.(a) Early adoption is permitted.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 37OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESWe engage in a variety of activities that involve entities that are not consolidated or otherwise reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. Additional information on these types of activities is included in our 2017 Form 10-K and in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities and Note 13 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.A summary of variable interest entities (VIEs), including those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements, is included in Note 2 in our 2017 Form 10-K.Trust Preferred Securities and REIT Preferred SecuritiesSee Note 10 Borrowed Funds and Note 15 Equity in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information on trust preferred securities issued by PNC Capital Trust C including information on contractual limitations potentially imposed on payments (including dividends) with respect to PNC's equity securities and for additional information on the 2017 redemption of the REIT preferred securities issued by PNC Preferred Funding Trust I and PNC Preferred Funding Trust II. INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESAs of September 30, 2018, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of September 30, 2018, and that there has been no change in PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.GLOSSARY OF TERMSFor a glossary of terms commonly used in our filings, please see the glossary of terms included in our 2017 Form 10-K. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONWe make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance.Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.•Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:–Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets.–Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets.–Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.–Changes in customer behavior due to recently enacted tax legislation, changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives.–Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness.–Impact of tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners.–Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic expansion.–Commodity price volatility.•Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory 38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Qcontingencies. These statements are based on our view that U.S. economic growth has accelerated over the past two years and will remain above its long-run trend for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019, in light of stimulus from corporate and personal income tax cuts passed in late 2017 that are expected to support business investment and consumer spending, respectively. We expect an increase in federal government spending will also support economic growth for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. Further gradual improvement in the labor market this year and next, including job gains and rising wages, is another positive for consumer spending. Trade restrictions are a growing downside risk to the forecast. Inflation has accelerated to close to the Federal Open Market Committee's two percent objective. Short-term interest rates and bond yields are expected to rise throughout the remainder of 2018 and into 2019; after the Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate in September, our baseline forecast is for one additional rate hike in December 2018, pushing the rate to a range of 2.25% to 2.50% by the end of the year. We expect two 25 basis point increases in the fed funds rate in 2019 (in June and September); this would take the fed funds rate to a range of 2.75% to 3.00% by the end of next year.•Our ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board as part of our comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the Federal Reserve Board.•Our regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect (particularly those implementing the international regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee)), and management actions affecting the composition of our balance sheet. In addition, our ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.•Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:–Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles.–Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards.–Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to us.–Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.–Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.•Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.•Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings.•We grow our business in part through acquisitions. Acquisition risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.•Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.•Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2017 Form 10-K, our 2018 Form 10-Qs, and elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in those reports.

(PNC) is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our primary geographic markets are located in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also provide certain products and services internationally.NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of Financial Statement PresentationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned, certain partnership interests and variable interest entities.We prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current period presentation, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments needed to present fairly our results for the interim periods. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period.We have also considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements.When preparing these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, we have assumed that you have read the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2017 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2017 Form 10-K for a detailed description of significant accounting policies. There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies as disclosed in our 2017 Form 10-K, except for those accounting policies included in this Note 1 as a result of the adoption of new accounting standards that were effective in the first quarter of 2018. See our first quarter 2018 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q) for more detail on these new accounting standards. These interim consolidated financial statements serve to update our 2017 Form 10-K and may not include all information and Notes necessary to constitute a complete set of financial statements.Use of EstimatesWe prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Our most significant estimates pertain to our fair value measurements and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionWe earn interest and noninterest income from various sources, including:•Lending,•Securities portfolio,•Asset management,•Customer deposits,•Loan sales, loan securitizations, and servicing,•Brokerage services,•Sale of securities,•Certain private equity activities, and•Securities, derivatives and foreign exchange activities.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 45In addition, we earn fees and commissions from:•Issuing loan commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees,•Deposit account services,•Merchant services,•Selling various insurance products,•Providing treasury management services,•Providing merger and acquisition advisory and related services•Debit and credit card transactions, and•Participating in certain capital markets transactions.Our Asset management noninterest income also includes our share of the earnings of BlackRock recognized under the equity method of accounting.We record private equity income or loss based on changes in the valuation of the underlying investments or when we dispose of our interest.We recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments where we have elected the fair value option. These financial instruments include certain commercial and residential mortgage loans originated for sale, certain residential mortgage portfolio loans, resale agreements and our investment in BlackRock Series C preferred stock. We also recognize gain/(loss) on changes in the fair value of residential and commercial mortgage servicing rights (MSRs).We recognize revenue from servicing residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans as earned based on the specific contractual terms. These revenues are reported on the Consolidated Income Statement in the line items Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Consumer services. We recognize revenue from securities, derivatives and foreign exchange customer-related trading, as well as securities underwriting activities, as these transactions occur or as services are provided. We generally recognize gains from the sale of loans upon receipt of cash. Mortgage revenue recognized is reported net of mortgage repurchase reserves.For the fee-based revenue within the scope of ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), revenue is recognized when or as those services are transferred to the customer. See Note 15 Fee-based Revenue from Contracts with Customers for additional information related to revenue within the scope of Topic 606.Equity Securities and Partnership InterestsWe account for equity securities and equity investments other than BlackRock and private equity investments under one of the following methods:•Equity securities that have a readily determinable fair value are included in Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in Noninterest income. Dividend income on these equity securities is included in Other interest income on our consolidated income statement.•For investments in limited partnerships, limited liability companies and other investments that are not required to be consolidated, we use either the equity method of accounting or the practicability exception to fair value. We use the equity method for general and limited partner ownership interests and limited liability companies in which we are considered to have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Under the equity method, we record our equity ownership share of net income or loss of the investee in Noninterest income and any dividends received on equity method investments are recorded as a reduction to the investment balance. When an equity investment experiences an other-than-temporary decline in value, we may be required to record a loss on the investment. •We generally use the practicability exception to fair value for all other investments. When we elect this alternative measurement method, the carrying value is adjusted for impairment, if any, plus or minus changes in value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar instruments of the same issuer. These investments are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates impairment and the fair value is less than the carrying value. The amount of the write-down is accounted for as a loss included in Noninterest income. Distributions received on these investments are included in Noninterest income. Investments described above are included in Equity investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.See Note 1 Accounting Policies of our 2017 Form 10-K for a discussion on our accounting for our investment in BlackRock and private equity investments.Derivative Instruments and Hedging ActivitiesWe use a variety of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to interest rate, market and credit risk inherent in our business activities. Interest rate and total return swaps, swaptions, interest rate caps 46 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Qand floors, options, forwards, and futures contracts are the primary instruments we use for risk management. Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, interest rate, market and credit risk. We manage these risks as part of our asset and liability management process and through credit policies and procedures.We recognize all derivative instruments at fair value as either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related cash flows in the Operating Activities section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Adjustments for counterparty credit risk are included in the determination of fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a cash flow or net investment hedging relationship. For all other derivatives, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.We utilize a net presentation for derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash collateral exchanged with counterparties is also netted against the applicable derivative exposures by offsetting obligations to return, or general rights to reclaim, cash collateral against the fair values of the net derivatives being collateralized.For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, we designate the hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation.We formally document the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy, before undertaking an accounting hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, the derivatives and related hedged items must be designated as a hedge at inception of the hedge relationship. In addition, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. For accounting hedge relationships, we formally assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, if the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting designated changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that the derivative instrument is not highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. We assess effectiveness using statistical regression analysis. Where the critical terms of the derivative and hedged item match, effectiveness may be assessed qualitatively. For derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability attributable to a particular risk, such as changes in LIBOR), changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in earnings and offset by also recognizing in earnings the changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. To the extent the change in fair value of the derivative does not offset the change in fair value of the hedged item, the difference is reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same income statement line as the hedged item.For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows), the gain or loss on derivatives is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified to income in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect earnings and recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged cash flows. For derivatives designated as a hedge of net investment in a foreign operation, the gain or loss on the derivatives are reported as a component of AOCI.We discontinue hedge accounting when it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge; the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or the derivative is de-designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge or, for a cash flow hedge, it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period.We purchase or originate financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative. For financial instruments not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, we assess, at inception of the transaction, if the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and whether a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be a derivative. If the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and meets the definition of a derivative, the embedded derivative is recorded separately from the host contract with changes in fair value recorded in earnings, unless we elect to account for the hybrid instrument at fair value.We have elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value measurement for certain financial instruments with embedded derivatives.We enter into commitments to originate residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale. We also enter into commitments to purchase or sell commercial and residential real estate loans. These commitments are accounted for as free-standing derivatives which are recorded at fair value in Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any gain or loss from the change in fair value after the inception of the commitment is recognized in Noninterest income.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsWe did not adopt any new accounting standards that had a significant impact during the third quarter of 2018.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 47NOTE 2 LOAN SALE AND SERVICING ACTIVITIES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESLoan Sale and Servicing ActivitiesAs more fully described in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2017 Form 10-K, we have transferred residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have continuing involvement. Our continuing involvement generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans under certain conditions and loss share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization special purpose entities (SPEs).We earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of loan transfer where we retain the servicing, we recognize a servicing right at fair value. See Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for information on our servicing rights, including the carrying value of servicing assets.The following table provides cash flows associated with our loan sale and servicing activities.

Table 36 presents information about the principal balances of transferred loans that we service and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would only experience a loss on these transferred loans if we were required to repurchase a loan, where the repurchase price exceeded the loan's fair value, due to a breach in representations and warranties or a loss sharing arrangement associated with our continuing involvement with these loans. The estimate of losses related to breaches in representations and warranties was insignificant at September 30, 2018.48 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 36: Principal Balance, Delinquent Loans and Net Charge-offs Related to Serviced Loans For Others In millionsResidentialMortgages  CommercialMortgages (a) September 30, 2018     Total principal balance$55,085  $49,706 Delinquent loans (b)$662  $240 December 31, 2017     Total principal balance$58,320  $49,116 Delinquent loans (b)$899  $355 Three months ended September 30, 2018     Net charge-offs (c)$9  $117 Three months ended September 30, 2017     Net charge-offs (c)$13  $228 Nine months ended September 30, 2018     Net charge-offs (c)$34  $169 Nine months ended September 30, 2017     Net charge-offs (c)$62  $639 (a)Represents information at the securitization level in which we have sold loans and we are the servicer for the securitization.(b)Serviced delinquent loans are 90 days or more past due or are in process of foreclosure.(c)Net charge-offs for Residential mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported to investors during the period. Net charge-offs for Commercial mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported by the trustee for commercial mortgage backed securitizations. Realized losses for Agency securitizations are not reflected as we do not manage the underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to loss information.Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2017 Form 10-K, we are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be VIEs.The following table provides a summary of non-consolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement but are not the primary beneficiary. We have excluded certain transactions with non-consolidated VIEs from the balances presented in Table 37 where we have determined that our continuing involvement is not significant. We do not consider our continuing involvement to be significant when it relates to a VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or where no transfers have occurred between us and the VIE. In addition, where we only have lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these transactions with non-consolidated entities from the balances presented in Table 37. These loans are included as part of the asset quality disclosures that we make in Note 3 Asset Quality.Table 37: Non-Consolidated VIEs In millionsPNC Risk of Loss (a)  Carrying Value of AssetsOwned by PNC   Carrying Value of LiabilitiesOwned by PNC September 30, 2018         Mortgage-Backed Securitizations (b)$13,892  $13,892(c)     Tax Credit Investments and Other3,015  3,003(d)   $790(e) Total$16,907  $16,895   $790 December 31, 2017         Mortgage-Backed Securitizations (b)$9,738  $9,738(c)    Tax Credit Investments and Other3,069  3,001(d)   $858(e) Total$12,807  $12,739   $858 (a)This represents loans, investments and other assets related to non-consolidated VIEs, net of collateral (if applicable).

The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we recognized $168 million of amortization, $179 million of tax credits, and $39 million of other tax benefits associated with qualified investments in low income housing tax credits within Income taxes. The amounts for the third quarter of 2018 were $56 million, $60 million and $13 million, respectively.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 49NOTE 3 ASSET QUALITYWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates may be a key indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the loan portfolios. The measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO, foreclosed and other assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans as these loans are accounted for at fair value. However, when nonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is not recognized on these loans. Additionally, certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest. Purchased impaired loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information on our loan related policies. The following tables display the delinquency status of our loans and our nonperforming assets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.Table 38: Analysis of Loan Portfolio (a) Accruing      Dollars in millionsCurrent or LessThan 30 DaysPast Due30-59 DaysPast Due60-89 DaysPast Due90 DaysOr MorePast DueTotal PastDue  NonperformingLoansFair ValueOptionNonaccrualLoans (c)PurchasedImpairedLoansTotalLoans (d) September 30, 2018           Commercial Lending           Commercial$113,189$60$35$67$162 $320  $113,671 Commercial real estate28,48483 11 68  28,563 Equipment lease financing7,1642916 45 5  7,214 Total commercial lending148,837975467218 393 149,448 Consumer Lending           Home equity24,9677730 107 828 $72626,628 Residential real estate15,73313067357554(b)363$1771,37618,203 Credit card5,852452848121 6  5,979 Other consumer           Automobile14,077104258137 95  14,309 Education and other8,1869854139291(b) 9  8,486 Total consumer lending68,8154542045521,210 1,3011772,10273,605 Total$217,652$551$258$619$1,428 $1,694$177$2,102$223,053 Percentage of total loans97.58%.25%.12%.28%.64% .76%.08%.94%100.00% December 31, 2017           Commercial Lending           Commercial$109,989$45$25$39$109 $429 $110,527 Commercial real estate28,826272 29 123 28,978 Equipment lease financing7,914171 18 2  7,934 Total commercial lending146,729892839156 554  147,439 Consumer Lending           Home equity26,5617826 104 818 $88128,364 Residential real estate14,38915174486711(b) 400$1971,51517,212 Credit card5,579432645114 6  5,699 Other consumer           Automobile12,69779208107 76  12,880 Education and other8,52510564159328(b) 11  8,864 Total consumer lending67,7514562106981,364 1,3111972,39673,019 Total$214,480$545$238$737$1,520 $1,865$197$2,396$220,458 Percentage of total loans97.29%.25%.11%.33%.69% .85%.09%1.08%100.00% 50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q(a)Amounts in table represent recorded investment and exclude loans held for sale. Recorded investment in a loan includes the unpaid principal balance plus net accounting adjustments, less any charge-offs. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.(b)Past due loan amounts exclude purchased impaired loans, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed Residential real estate mortgages totaling $.5 billion and $.6 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and Education and other consumer loans totaling $.2 billion and $.3 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.(c)Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option for which we do not expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are subject to nonaccrual accounting and classification upon meeting any of our nonaccrual policies. Given that these loans are not accounted for at amortized cost, these loans have been excluded from the nonperforming loan population.(d)Net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees, unamortized discounts and premiums, and purchase discounts and premiums totaling $1.2 billion at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.At September 30, 2018, we pledged $17.0 billion of commercial loans to the Federal Reserve Bank and $63.7 billion of residential real estate and other loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank as collateral for the ability to borrow, if necessary. The comparable amounts at December 31, 2017 were $18.7 billion and $62.8 billion, respectively.Table 39: Nonperforming Assets Dollars in millions September 302018 December 312017 Nonperforming loans     Total commercial lending $393 $554 Total consumer lending (a) 1,301 1,311 Total nonperforming loans 1,694 1,865 OREO, foreclosed and other assets 131 170 Total nonperforming assets $1,825 $2,035 Nonperforming loans to total loans .76% .85% Nonperforming assets to total loans, OREO, foreclosed and other assets .82% .92% Nonperforming assets to total assets .48% .53% (a)Excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.Nonperforming loans also include certain loans whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2017 Form 10-K and the TDR section of this Note 3.Total nonperforming loans in Table 39 include TDRs of $.9 billion at September 30, 2018 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2017. TDRs that are performing, including consumer credit card TDR loans, totaled $1.0 billion at September 30, 2018 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017, and are excluded from nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are returned to accrual status and classified as performing after demonstrating a period of at least six months of consecutive performance under the restructured terms. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. See the TDRs section of this Note 3 for more information on TDRs.Additional Asset Quality IndicatorsWe have two overall portfolio segments – Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending. Each of these two segments comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in initial measurement, risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. The Commercial Lending segment is composed of the commercial, commercial real estate and equipment lease financing loan classes. The Consumer Lending segment is composed of the home equity, residential real estate, credit card and other consumer loan classes.Commercial Lending Loan ClassesThe following table presents asset quality indicators for the Commercial Lending loan classes. See Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information related to our Commercial Lending loan classes, including discussion around the asset quality indicators that we use to monitor and manage the credit risk associated with each loan class.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 51Table 40: Commercial Lending Asset Quality Indicators (a)    Criticized Commercial Loans   In millions Pass Rated SpecialMention (b) Substandard (c) Doubtful (d) Total Loans September 30, 2018           Commercial $107,854 $2,046 $3,722 $49 $113,671 Commercial real estate 28,194 127 241 1 28,563 Equipment lease financing 7,063 84 64 3 7,214 Total commercial lending $143,111 $2,257 $4,027 $53 $149,448 December 31, 2017           Commercial $105,280 $1,858 $3,331 $58 $110,527 Commercial real estate 28,380 148 435 15 28,978 Equipment lease financing 7,754 77 102 1 7,934 Total commercial lending $141,414 $2,083 $3,868 $74 $147,439 (a)Loans are classified as “Pass”, “Special Mention”, “Substandard” and “Doubtful” based on the Regulatory Classification definitions. We use probability of default and loss given default to rate commercial loans.(b)Special Mention rated loans have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of repayment prospects at some future date. These loans do not expose us to sufficient risk to warrant a more adverse classification at the reporting date.(c)Substandard rated loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection or liquidation of debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.(d)Doubtful rated loans possess all the inherent weaknesses of a Substandard rated loan with the additional characteristics that the weakness makes collection or liquidation in full improbable due to existing facts, conditions and values.Consumer Lending Loan ClassesSee Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information related to our Consumer Lending loan classes, including discussion around the asset quality indicators that we use to monitor and manage the credit risk associated with each loan class.Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loan ClassesThe following table presents asset quality indicators for the home equity and residential real estate loan classes, excluding consumer purchased impaired loans of $2.1 billion and $2.4 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and government insured or guaranteed residential real estate mortgages of $.7 billion and $.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.Table 41: Asset Quality Indicators for Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loans – Excluding Purchased Impaired and Government Insured or Guaranteed Loans (a)  Home Equity ResidentialReal Estate Total September 30, 2018 - in millions 1st Liens 2nd Liens  Current estimated LTV ratios         Greater than or equal to 125% and updated FICO scores:         Greater than 660 $163 $348 $134 $645 Less than or equal to 660 (b) 27 47 15 89 Missing FICO 1 4 1 6 Greater than or equal to 100% to less than 125% and updated FICO scores:         Greater than 660 280 720 269 1,269 Less than or equal to 660 (b) 38 89 30 157 Missing FICO 1 5 3 9 Greater than or equal to 90% to less than 100% and updated FICO scores:         Greater than 660 299 814 315 1,428 Less than or equal to 660 41 93 24 158 Missing FICO 2 5 4 11 Less than 90% and updated FICO scores:         Greater than 660 13,075 7,721 14,724 35,520 Less than or equal to 660 1,157 775 555 2,487 Missing FICO 35 48 92 175 Total home equity and residential real estate loans $15,119 $10,669 $16,166 $41,954 52 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QDecember 31, 2017 - in millions Home Equity ResidentialReal Estate Total 1st Liens 2nd Liens  Current estimated LTV ratios         Greater than or equal to 125% and updated FICO scores:         Greater than 660 $108 $385 $126 $619 Less than or equal to 660 (b) 21 64 23 108 Missing FICO 1 5 1 7 Greater than or equal to 100% to less than 125% and updated FICO scores:         Greater than 660 300 842 253 1,395 Less than or equal to 660 (b) 46 143 45 234 Missing FICO 2 9 5 16 Greater than or equal to 90% to less than 100% and updated FICO scores:         Greater than 660 331 890 324 1,545 Less than or equal to 660 55 134 55 244 Missing FICO 2 9 4 15 Less than 90% and updated FICO scores:         Greater than 660 13,954 8,066 13,445 35,465 Less than or equal to 660 1,214 774 507 2,495 Missing FICO 42 57 95 194 Total home equity and residential real estate loans $16,076 $11,378 $14,883 $42,337 (a)Amounts shown represent recorded investment.(b)Higher risk loans are defined as loans with both an updated FICO score of less than or equal to 660 and an updated LTV greater than or equal to 100%.

We use internal credit metrics, such as delinquency status, geography or other factors, as an asset quality indicator for government guaranteed or insured education loans and consumer loans to high net worth individuals, as internal credit metrics are more relevant than FICO scores for these types of loans.(b)Credit card loans and other consumer loans with no FICO score available or required generally refers to new accounts issued to borrowers with limited credit history, accounts for which we cannot obtain an updated FICO score (e.g., recent profile changes), cards issued with a business name and/or cards secured by collateral. Management proactively assesses the risk and size of this loan portfolio and, when necessary, takes actions to mitigate the credit risk. Weighted-average updated FICO score excludes accounts with no FICO score available or required.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 53Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)Table 43 quantifies the number of loans that were classified as TDRs, as well as the change in the loans’ recorded investment as a result of becoming a TDR during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. Additionally, the table provides information about the types of TDR concessions. See Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional discussion of TDRs.Table 43: Financial Impact and TDRs by Concession Type (a)    Pre-TDRRecordedInvestment (b) Post-TDR Recorded Investment (c) During the three months ended September 30, 2018Dollars in millionsNumberof Loans  PrincipalForgiveness RateReduction Other Total Total commercial lending 18 $115 $2 $24 $81 $107 Total consumer lending 3,147 45   19 23 42 Total TDRs 3,165 $160 $2 $43 $104 $149 During the three months ended September 30, 2017Dollars in millions             Total commercial lending 25 $44 $14  $30 $44 Total consumer lending 2,965 52   $36 15 51 Total TDRs 2,990 $96 $14 $36 $45 $95    Pre-TDRRecordedInvestment (b) Post-TDR Recorded Investment (c) During the nine months ended September 30, 2018Dollars in millionsNumberof Loans  PrincipalForgiveness RateReduction Other Total Total commercial lending 65 $145 $2 $26 $105 $133 Total consumer lending 9,015 129 1 66 52 119 Total TDRs 9,080 $274 $3 $92 $157 $252 During the nine months ended September 30, 2017Dollars in millions             Total commercial lending 107 $256 $18 $6 $191 $215 Total consumer lending 8,839 179   116 62 178 Total TDRs 8,946 $435 $18 $122 $253 $393 (a)Impact of partial charge-offs at TDR date are included in this table.(b)Represents the recorded investment of the loans as of the quarter end prior to TDR designation, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable.(c)Represents the recorded investment of the TDRs as of the end of the quarter in which the TDR occurs, and excludes immaterial amounts of accrued interest receivable.After a loan is determined to be a TDR, we continue to track its performance under its most recent restructured terms. We consider a TDR to have subsequently defaulted when it becomes 60 days past due after the most recent date the loan was restructured. The recorded investment of loans that were both (i) classified as TDRs or were subsequently modified during each 12-month period preceding January 1, 2018 and January 1, 2017, respectively, and (ii) subsequently defaulted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 totaled $19 million and $44 million, respectively. The comparable amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 totaled $49 million and $107 million, respectively.Impaired LoansImpaired loans include commercial and consumer nonperforming loans and TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. TDRs that were previously recorded at amortized cost and are now classified and accounted for as held for sale are also included. Excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans accounted for as held for sale other than the TDRs described in the preceding sentence, loans accounted for under the fair value option, smaller balance homogeneous type loans and purchased impaired loans. We did not recognize any interest income on impaired loans that have not returned to performing status, while they were impaired during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. Table 44 provides further detail on impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment and the associated allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL). Certain commercial and consumer impaired loans do not have a related ALLL as the valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the recorded investment.54 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 44: Impaired Loans In millions UnpaidPrincipal Balance RecordedInvestment AssociatedAllowance Average RecordedInvestment (a) September 30, 2018         Impaired loans with an associated allowance         Total commercial lending $494 $333 $65 $357 Total consumer lending 933 879 145 925 Total impaired loans with an associated allowance 1,427 1,212 210 1,282 Impaired loans without an associated allowance         Total commercial lending 326 262   287 Total consumer lending 1,039 618   650 Total impaired loans without an associated allowance 1,365 880  937 Total impaired loans $2,792 $2,092 $210 $2,219 December 31, 2017         Impaired loans with an associated allowance         Total commercial lending $580 $353 $76 $419 Total consumer lending 1,061 1,014 195 1,072 Total impaired loans with an associated allowance 1,641 1,367 271 1,491 Impaired loans without an associated allowance         Total commercial lending 494 366   330 Total consumer lending 1,019 638   648 Total impaired loans without an associated allowance 1,513 1,004   978 Total impaired loans $3,154 $2,371 $271 $2,469 (a)Average recorded investment is for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.NOTE 4 ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES We maintain the ALLL at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the portfolios as of the balance sheet date. We use the two main portfolio segments – Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending, and develop and document the ALLL under separate methodologies for each of these portfolio segments.

See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies in our First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q for additional detail on this adoption.The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in Shareholders’ equity as AOCI, unless credit-related. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At September 30, 2018, AOCI included pretax gains of $27 million from derivatives that hedged the purchase of investment securities classified as held to maturity. The gains will be accreted into interest income as an adjustment of yield on the securities.Table 47 presents gross unrealized losses and fair value of debt securities at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The securities are segregated between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis. The table includes debt securities where a portion of other than temporary impairment (OTTI) has been recognized in AOCI.56 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 47: Gross Unrealized Loss and Fair Value of Debt Securities  Unrealized loss position lessthan 12 months Unrealized loss position 12months or more Total In millions UnrealizedLoss FairValue UnrealizedLoss FairValue UnrealizedLoss FairValue September 30, 2018             Securities Available for Sale             Debt securities             U.S. Treasury and government agencies $(177) $8,745 $(117) $2,253 $(294) $10,998 Residential mortgage-backed             Agency (331) 15,278 (507) 9,409 (838) 24,687 Non-agency (1) 105 (12) 308 (13) 413 Commercial mortgage-backed             Agency (8) 412 (77) 1,473 (85) 1,885 Non-agency (19) 1,128 (10) 196 (29) 1,324 Asset-backed (14) 3,095 (3) 372 (17) 3,467 Other debt (24) 1,564 (27) 838 (51) 2,402 Total debt securities available for sale $(574) $30,327 $(753) $14,849 $(1,327) $45,176 Securities Held to Maturity             Debt securities             U.S. Treasury and government agencies     $(38) $429 $(38) $429 Residential mortgage-backed - Agency $(232) $8,631 (341) 5,797 (573) 14,428 Commercial mortgage-backed             Agency (2) 64     (2) 64Non-agency (1) 344     (1) 344 Other debt (7) 144 (21) 102 (28) 246 Total debt securities held to maturity $(242) $9,183 $(400) $6,328 $(642) $15,511 December 31, 2017             Securities Available for Sale             Debt securities             U.S. Treasury and government agencies $(42) $6,099 $(42) $1,465 $(84) $7,564 Residential mortgage-backed             Agency (47) 8,151 (202) 9,954 (249) 18,105 Non-agency   (21) 383 (21) 383 Commercial mortgage-backed             Agency (11) 524 (47) 1,302 (58) 1,826 Non-agency (3) 400 (6) 333 (9) 733 Asset-backed (4) 1,697 (4) 462 (8) 2,159 Other debt (3) 966 (14) 798 (17) 1,764 Total debt securities available for sale $(110) $17,837 $(336) $14,697 $(446) $32,534 Securities Held to Maturity             Debt securities             U.S. Treasury and government agencies $(3) $195 $(10) $255 $(13) $450 Residential mortgage-backed - Agency (10) 3,167 (129) 6,168 (139) 9,335 Other debt (12) 83 (8) 67 (20) 150 Total debt securities held to maturity $(25) $3,445 $(147) $6,490 $(172) $9,935 Evaluating Investment Securities for OTTIFor the securities in Table 47, as of September 30, 2018 we do not intend to sell and believe we will not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis.On at least a quarterly basis, we review all debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position for OTTI, as discussed in Note 1 Accounting Policies of our 2017 Form 10-K. For those securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2018, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represented OTTI, we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.1 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities.The majority of these cumulative impairment charges related to non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities rated BB or lower. During the first nine months of 2018 and 2017, the OTTI credit losses recognized in noninterest income and the OTTI noncredit losses recognized in AOCI on securities were not significant.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 57Information relating to gross realized securities gains and losses from the sales of securities is set forth in the following table:Table 48: Gains (Losses) on Sales of Securities Available for SaleNine months ended September 30In millionsProceedsGross GainsGross LossesNet Gains (Losses)Tax Expense (Benefit)  2018$5,464$43$(48)(5)$(1) 2017$4,221$31$(21)$10$3 The following table presents, by remaining contractual maturity, the amortized cost, fair value and weighted-average yield of debt securities at September 30, 2018.Table 49: Contractual Maturity of Debt SecuritiesSeptember 30, 2018Dollars in millions 1 Year or Less After 1 Yearthrough 5 Years After 5 Yearsthrough 10 Years After 10Years Total Securities Available for Sale           U.S. Treasury and government agencies $265 $12,052 $4,434 $303 $17,054 Residential mortgage-backed           Agency 2 67 611 28,014 28,694 Non-agency       2,034 2,034 Commercial mortgage-backed           Agency 4 457 412 1,177 2,050 Non-agency     445 2,116 2,561 Asset-backed 18 2,129 2,110 1,288 5,545 Other debt 604 1,694 692 979 3,969 Total debt securities available for sale $893 $16,399 $8,704 $35,911 $61,907 Fair value $892 $16,160 $8,666 $35,493 $61,211 Weighted-average yield, GAAP basis 2.63% 2.17% 2.93% 3.16% 2.85% Securities Held to Maturity           U.S. Treasury and government agencies     $484 $270 $754 Residential mortgage-backed           Agency   $69 507 15,386 15,962 Non-agency       155 155 Commercial mortgage-backed           Agency $62 47 4 51 164 Non-agency       502 502 Asset-backed   12 100 75 187 Other debt 34 532 803 500 1,869 Total debt securities held to maturity $96 $660 $1,898 $16,939 $19,593 Fair value $96 $668 $1,912 $16,345 $19,021 Weighted-average yield, GAAP basis 4.67% 3.82% 3.45% 3.26% 3.30% Weighted-average yields are based on amortized cost with effective yields weighted for the contractual maturity of each security.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date, determined using an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value hierarchy established by GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 6 Fair Value in our 2017 Form 10-K.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFor more information on the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, see Note 6 Fair Value in our 2017 Form 10-K. The following table summarizes our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including instruments for which we have elected the fair value option.Table 51: Fair Value Measurements – Recurring Basis Summary  September 30, 2018  December 31, 2017 In millionsLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalFair Value  Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalFair Value Assets                 Residential mortgage loans held for sale  $628 $3 $631    $829 $3 $832 Commercial mortgage loans held for sale  329 89 418    723 107 830 Securities available for sale                 U.S. Treasury and government agencies$16,422 429   16,851  $14,088 433   14,521 Residential mortgage-backed                 Agency  27,902   27,902    25,406   25,406 Non-agency  84 2,268 2,352    97 2,661 2,758 Commercial mortgage-backed                 Agency  1,965   1,965    1,904   1,904 Non-agency  2,539   2,539    2,613   2,613 Asset-backed  5,299 293 5,592    5,065 332 5,397 Other debt  3,921 89 4,010    4,347 87 4,434 Total debt securities16,422 42,139 2,650 61,211  14,088 39,865 3,080 57,033 Other (a)        524 61   585 Total securities available for sale16,422 42,139 2,650 61,211  14,612 39,926 3,080 57,618 Loans  472 281 753    571 298 869 Equity investments (b)591 59 1,042 1,904      1,036 1,265 Residential mortgage servicing rights    1,370 1,370      1,164 1,164 Commercial mortgage servicing rights    766 766      668 668 Trading securities (c)1,678 1,883 2 3,563  1,243 1,670 2 2,915 Financial derivatives (c) (d)   1,781 8 1,789    2,864 10 2,874 Other assets 309 186 58 553  278 253 107 638 Total assets$19,000 $47,477 $6,269 $72,958  $16,133 $46,836 $6,475 $69,673 Liabilities                 Other borrowed funds$517 $361 $9 $887  $1,079 $254 $11 $1,344 Financial derivatives (d) (e)   2,600 342 2,942    2,369 487 2,856 Other liabilities    55 55      33 33 Total liabilities$517 $2,961 $406 $3,884  $1,079 $2,623 $531 $4,233 (a)Prior period amounts included $.6 billion of available for sale securities, primarily money market funds, that were reclassified to equity investments on January 1, 2018 as the result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01.

Impairment taken on those equity securities was immaterial during the first nine months of 2018.For more information regarding the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments included in Table 58, see Note 6 Fair Value in our 2017 Form 10-K.NOTE 7 GOODWILL AND MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTSGoodwillSee Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights in our 2017 Form 10-K for more information regarding our goodwill.Mortgage Servicing Rights  We recognize the right to service mortgage loans for others when we recognize it as an intangible asset and the servicing income we receive is more than adequate compensation. MSRs totaled $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and consisted of loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential mortgages measured at fair value.MSRs are subject to declines in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of MSRs decreases (or increases).See the Sensitivity Analysis section of this Note 7, as well as Note 6 Fair Value in our 2017 Form 10-K for more detail on our fair value measurement of MSRs. Refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights in our 2017 Form 10-K for more information on our accounting and measurement of MSRs.68 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QChanges in the commercial and residential MSRs follow:Table 59: Mortgage Servicing Rights Commercial MSRs Residential MSRs In millions20182017 20182017 January 1$668$576 $1,164$1,182 Additions:      From loans sold with servicing retained3965 3542 Purchases6048 113172 Changes in fair value due to:      Time and payoffs (a)(105)(81) (130)(130) Other (b)10420 188(40) September 30$766$628 $1,370$1,226 Related unpaid principal balance at September 30$174,664$153,059 $127,099$129,210 Servicing advances at September 30$193$240 $156$222 (a)Represents decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and loans that were paid down or paid off during the period.(b)Represents MSR value changes resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates.Sensitivity AnalysisThe fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of September 30, 2018 are shown in Tables 60 and 61. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses both internal proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate.A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented in Tables 60 and 61. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (e.g., changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.The following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and the sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions.Table 60: Commercial Mortgage Loan Servicing Rights – Key Valuation AssumptionsDollars in millionsSeptember 302018 December 312017 Fair value$766 $668 Weighted-average life (years)4.2 4.4 Weighted-average constant prepayment rate6.36% 8.51% Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change$10 $12 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change$20 $23 Effective discount rate8.61% 7.81% Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change$21 $18 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change$42 $36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 69Table 61: Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing Rights – Key Valuation AssumptionsDollars in millionsSeptember 302018 December 312017 Fair value$1,370 $1,164 Weighted-average life (years)7.2 6.4 Weighted-average constant prepayment rate8.13% 10.04% Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change$39 $44 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change$75 $85 Weighted-average option adjusted spread820bps830bpsDecline in fair value from 10% adverse change$41 $35 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change$80 $67 Fees from mortgage loan servicing, which includes contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and ancillary fees were $.2 billion for both the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 and $.4 billion for both the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. We also generate servicing fees from fee-based activities provided to others for which we do not have an associated servicing asset. Fees from commercial and residential MSRs are reported within Noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement in the line items Corporate services and Residential mortgage, respectively.NOTE 8 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSPension and Postretirement PlansAs described in Note 11 Employee Benefit Plans in our 2017 Form 10-K, we have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation. Beginning in 2018, these earnings credits are subject to a minimum annual amount. Any pension contributions to the plan are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants. We made a voluntary contribution of $.2 billion in September 2018 to the qualified pension plan. We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. We reserve the right to terminate or make changes to these plans at any time.The components of our net periodic benefit cost for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were as follows: Table 62: Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost (a) Qualified Pension Plan  Nonqualified Pension Plan  Postretirement Benefits Three months ended September 30In millions2018 2017  2018 2017  2018 2017 Net periodic cost consists of:              Service cost$29 $26  $1 $1  $1 $2 Interest cost43 45  2 2  3 3 Expected return on plan assets(76) (71)      (1) (2) Amortization of prior service credit  (1)         Amortization of actuarial losses  11  1 1      Net periodic cost/(benefit)$(4) $10  $4 $4  $3 $3  Qualified Pension Plan  Nonqualified Pension Plan  Postretirement Benefits Nine months ended September 30In millions2018 2017  2018 2017  2018 2017 Net periodic cost consists of:              Service cost$87 $77  $2 $2  $3 $4 Interest cost128 134  7 8  9 10 Expected return on plan assets(229) (213)      (4) (4) Amortization of prior service credit1 (3)        (1) Amortization of actuarial losses  33  3 3      Net periodic cost/(benefit)$(13) $28  $12 $13  $8 $9 (a)The service cost component is included in Personnel expense on the Consolidated Income Statement.

We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.For more information regarding derivatives see Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our 2017 Form 10-K.The following table presents the notional amounts and gross fair values of all derivative assets and liabilities held by us.Table 63: Total Gross Derivatives September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017In millionsNotional /ContractAmount Asset FairValue (a) Liability FairValue (b) Notional /ContractAmount Asset FairValue (a) Liability FairValue (b)Derivatives used for hedging under GAAP           Interest rate contracts (c):           Fair value hedges$33,232 $14   $34,059 $114 $94Cash flow hedges17,394     23,875 60 6Foreign exchange contracts:           Net investment hedges1,042 36   1,060  11Total derivatives designated for hedging under GAAP$51,668$50$58,994$174$111Derivatives not used for hedging under GAAP           Derivatives used for mortgage banking activities (d):           Interest rate contracts:           Swaps$71,254   $3 $48,335 $162 $42Futures (e)44,063     47,494  Mortgage-backed commitments6,595 $21 16 8,999 19 9Other4,610 5 2 2,530 11 2Subtotal126,5222621107,35819253Derivatives used for customer-related activities:           Interest rate contracts:           Swaps216,998 1,039 1,946 194,042 2,079 1,772Futures (e)3,550     3,453  Mortgage-backed commitments3,280 9 2 2,228 2 2Other21,581 66 71 17,775 75 36Subtotal245,4091,1142,019 217,498 2,156 1,810Foreign exchange contracts and other28,494 581 552 27,330 349 332Subtotal273,9031,6952,571 244,828 2,505 2,142Derivatives used for other risk management activities:           Foreign exchange contracts and other (f)8,780 18 350 7,445 3 550Total derivatives not designated for hedging under GAAP$409,205$1,739$2,942$359,631$2,700$2,745Total gross derivatives$460,873$1,789$2,942$418,625$2,874$2,856Less: Impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements  710 710   1,054 1,054Less: Cash collateral received/paid  80 728   636 763Total derivatives  $999$1,504$1,184$1,039(a)Included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.(b)Included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.(c)Represents primarily swaps.(d)Includes both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities.(e)Futures contracts settle in cash daily and, therefore, no derivative asset or derivative liability is recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.(f)Includes our obligation to fund a portion of certain BlackRock LTIP programs and the swaps entered into in connection with sales of a portion of Visa Class B common shares.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 71All derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion regarding the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable master netting agreements is included in the Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk and Contingent Features section of this Note 9. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of the derivatives. Exchange-traded and over-the-counter cleared derivative instruments are typically settled in cash each day based on the prior day value. In the first quarter of 2018, we changed our presentation for variation margin related to derivative instruments cleared through a central clearinghouse as a result of changes made by that clearinghouse to its rules governing such instruments with its counterparties. This variation margin is now recorded as a settlement payment instead of collateral. The impact at September 30, 2018 was a reduction of gross derivative assets and gross derivative liabilities of $1.8 billion and $.6 billion, respectively. The accounting change had no impact on the net fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities that otherwise would have been reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Table 67 for more information. Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAPCertain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and losses on those derivatives to be recognized in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings impact of the hedged items.Fair Value HedgesWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item.Cash Flow HedgesWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the consideration that will be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. For these cash flow hedges, gains and losses on the interest rate swaps and forward contracts are recorded in AOCI and are then reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows affect earnings and within the same income statement line as the hedged cash flows.In the 12 months that follow September 30, 2018, we expect to reclassify net derivative losses of $39 million pretax, or $31 million after-tax, from AOCI to interest income for both cash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to September 30, 2018. As of September 30, 2018, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is ten years.The amount of cash flow hedge ineffectiveness recognized in income was not significant for the 2017 period presented.72 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QDetail regarding the net gains (losses) related to our fair value and cash flow hedge derivatives is presented in the following table.Table 64: Gains (Losses) Recognized on Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges in the Consolidated Income Statement (a) (b) Location and Amount of Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income Interest IncomeInterest ExpenseNoninterest IncomeIn millionsLoansInvestment SecuritiesBorrowed FundsOtherFor the three months ended September 30, 2018    Total amounts on the Consolidated Income Statement$2,452$584$421$301Gains (losses) on fair value hedges recognized on:    Hedged items (c)$(31)$107Derivatives$30$(137)Amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives$2$24Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges (d):    Amount of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated OCI$6$2$1For the three months ended September 30, 2017    Total amounts on the Consolidated Income Statement$2,140$501$280$313Gains (losses) on fair value hedges recognized on:    Hedged items $(8)$50 Derivatives $9$(56) Amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives $(9)$53 Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges - interest rate contracts (d):    Amount of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated OCI$38$5 $2For the nine months ended September 30, 2018    Total amounts on the Consolidated Income Statement$7,025$1,653$1,173$880Gains (losses) on fair value hedges recognized on:    Hedged items (c) $(145)$577 Derivatives $149$(632) Amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives  $57 Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges (d):    Amount of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated OCI$43$9 $8For the nine months ended September 30, 2017    Total amounts on the Consolidated Income Statement$6,084$1,489$793$918Gains (losses) on fair value hedges recognized on:    Hedged items $4$61 Derivatives $(3)$(84) Amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives $(34)$190 Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges - interest rate contracts (d):    Amount of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated OCI$128$16 $5(a)For all periods presented, there were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for any of the fair value or cash flow hedge strategies. (b)All cash flow and fair value hedge derivatives were interest rate contracts for the periods presented.(c)Includes an insignificant amount of fair value hedge adjustments related to discontinued hedge relationships.(d)For all periods presented, there were no gains or losses from cash flow hedge derivatives reclassified to income because it became probable that the original forecasted transaction would not occur. Detail regarding the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the carrying value of the hedged items is presented in the following table.Table 65: Hedged Items - Fair Value Hedges  September 30, 2018 In millionsCarrying Value of the Hedged Items Cumulative Fair Value Hedge Adjustment included in the Carrying Value of Hedged Items (a) Investment securities - Available for Sale (b)$7,056 $(230) Borrowed funds$28,284 $(686) (a)Includes $.6 billion of fair value hedge adjustments primarily related to discontinued borrowed funds hedge relationships.(b)Carrying value shown represents amortized cost.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 73Net Investment HedgesWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar net investments in foreign subsidiaries against adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for all periods presented. During the first three and nine months of 2017 there was no net investment hedge ineffectiveness. Gains (losses) on net investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI were net gains of $17 million and $47 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared with net losses of $26 million and $76 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively.Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAPWe also enter into derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. For additional information on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP, see Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our 2017 Form 10-K.Further detail regarding the gains (losses) on derivatives not designated in hedging relationships is presented in the following table.Table 66: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives Not Designated for Hedging under GAAP  Three months endedSeptember 30 Nine months endedSeptember 30 In millions20182017 20182017 Derivatives used for mortgage banking activities:      Interest rate contracts (a)$(34)$19 $(166)$92 Derivatives used for customer-related activities:      Interest rate contracts1510 9663 Foreign exchange contracts and other2238 79110 Gains (losses) from customer-related activities (b)3748 175173 Derivatives used for other risk management activities:      Foreign exchange contracts and other (b) (c)(19)(101) 111(257) Total gains (losses) from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments$(16)$(34) $120$8 (a)Included in Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.(b)Included in Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.(c)Includes BlackRock LTIP funding obligation and the swaps entered into in connection with sales of a portion of Visa Class B common shares.Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk and Contingent FeaturesWe generally utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either party’s net position. For additional information on derivative offsetting, counterparty credit risk and contingent features, see Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our 2017 Form 10-K.Table 67 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The table also includes the fair value of any securities collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table only to the extent of the related net derivative fair values.74 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 67: Derivative Assets and Liabilities OffsettingIn millions   Amounts Offset on theConsolidated Balance Sheet     SecuritiesCollateral Held/ (Pledged)Under MasterNettingAgreements   GrossFair Value Fair ValueOffset Amount CashCollateral NetFair Value   Net Amounts September 30, 2018               Derivative assets               Interest rate contracts:               Over-the-counter cleared (a) $16     $16     $16 Over-the-counter 1,138 $432 $75 631   $19 612 Foreign exchange and other contracts 635 278 5 352     352 Total derivative assets $1,789$710$80$999 (b)  $19 $980 Derivative liabilities               Interest rate contracts:               Over-the-counter cleared (a) $11     $11     $11 Over-the-counter 2,029 $563 $435 1,031     1,031 Foreign exchange and other contracts 902 147 293 462     462 Total derivative liabilities $2,942 $710 $728 $1,504 (c)   $1,504 December 31, 2017               Derivative assets               Interest rate contracts:               Over-the-counter cleared $827 $251 $567 $9     $9 Over-the-counter 1,695 668 67 960   $32 928 Foreign exchange and other contracts 352 135 2 215     215 Total derivative assets $2,874$1,054$636$1,184 (b)  $32 $1,152 Derivative liabilities               Interest rate contracts:               Over-the-counter cleared $260 $251  $9     $9 Over-the-counter 1,703 662 $669 372     372 Foreign exchange and other contracts 893 141 94 658     658 Total derivative liabilities $2,856 $1,054 $763 $1,039 (c)   $1,039 (a)Reflects our first quarter 2018 change in accounting presentation for variation margin for certain derivative instruments cleared through a central clearing house.

OTC derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties that are not settled through an organized exchange or cleared through a central clearing house. The majority of OTC derivatives are governed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation or other legally enforceable master netting agreements. OTC cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes our counterparty. Exchange-traded derivatives represent standardized futures and options contracts executed directly on an organized exchange.In addition to using master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to reduce credit risk associated with derivative instruments, we also seek to manage credit risk by evaluating credit ratings of counterparties and by using internal credit analysis, limits and monitoring procedures.At September 30, 2018, we held cash, U.S. government securities and mortgage-backed securities totaling $.2 billion under master netting agreements and other collateral agreements to collateralize net derivative assets due from counterparties, and we pledged cash totaling $1.4 billion under these agreements to collateralize net derivative liabilities owed to counterparties and to meet initial margin requirements. These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals may include collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral held or pledged exceeds the net derivative fair values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 75Sheet. Securities held from counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise securities we have pledged to counterparties remain on our balance sheet. Certain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk related contingent provisions, such as those that require our debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position on September 30, 2018 was $2.2 billion for which we had posted collateral of $.8 billion in the normal course of business. The maximum additional amount of collateral we would have been required to post if the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on September 30, 2018 would be $1.4 billion.NOTE 10 EARNINGS PER SHARETable 68: Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share   Three months endedSeptember 30 Nine months endedSeptember 30 In millions, except per share data 2018 2017 2018 2017 Basic         Net income $1,400 $1,126 $3,995 $3,297 Less:         Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 11 12 31 39 Preferred stock dividends 63 63 181 181 Preferred stock discount accretion and redemptions 1 1 3 24 Net income attributable to common shares 1,3251,0503,7803,053 Less: Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities 6 5 16 15 Net income attributable to basic common shares $1,319$1,045 $3,764$3,038 Basic weighted-average common shares outstanding 465 479 469 483 Basic earnings per common share (a) $2.84 $2.18 $8.03 $6.29 Diluted         Net income attributable to basic common shares $1,319 $1,045 $3,764 $3,038 Less: Impact of BlackRock earnings per share dilution 2 3 7 8 Net income attributable to diluted common shares $1,317$1,042 $3,757$3,030 Basic weighted-average common shares outstanding 465 479 469 483 Dilutive potential common shares 2 4 3 5 Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding 467 483 472 488 Diluted earnings per common share (a) $2.82 $2.16 $7.96 $6.21 (a)Basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method are determined on net income reported on the income statement less earnings allocated to nonvested restricted shares and restricted share units with nonforfeitable dividends and dividend rights (participating securities).76 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QNOTE 11 TOTAL EQUITY AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEActivity in total equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 follows:Table 69: Rollforward of Total Equity    Shareholders’ Equity    In millionsSharesOutstandingCommonStock CommonStockCapitalSurplus -PreferredStockCapitalSurplus -CommonStock andOtherRetainedEarningsAccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncome (Loss)TreasuryStock Non-controllingInterestsTotal Equity Balance at January 1, 2017485 $2,709$3,977$12,674$31,670$(265)$(5,066) $1,155$46,854 Net income     3,258   393,297 Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax      243   243 Cash dividends declared           Common ($1.85 per share)     (904)    (904) Preferred     (181)    (181) Preferred stock discount accretion   5 (5)     Redemption of noncontrolling interests (a)     (19)   (981)(1,000) Common stock activity (b)  1 9     10 Treasury stock activity(9)   (274)  (1,396)  (1,670) Other    (48)    (149)(197) Balance at September 30, 2017 (c)476 $2,710$3,982$12,361$33,819$(22)$(6,462) $64$46,452 Balance at December 31, 2017473 $2,710$3,985$12,389$35,481$(148)$(6,904) $72$47,585 Cumulative effect of ASU adoptions (d)     (22)6   (16) Balance at January 1, 2018473 $2,710$3,985$12,389$35,459$(142)$(6,904) $72$47,569 Net income     3,964   313,995 Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax      (1,118)   (1,118) Cash dividends declared            Common ($2.45 per share)     (1,159)    (1,159) Preferred     (181)    (181) Preferred stock discount accretion   3 (3)      Common stock activity (b)    10     10 Treasury stock activity(11)   (31)  (1,867)  (1,898) Other   (6)(51)    (59)(116) Balance at September 30, 2018 (c)462 $2,710$3,982$12,317$38,080$(1,260)$(8,771) $44$47,102 (a)See Note 15 Equity in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information on the redemption of Perpetual Trust Securities.(b)Common stock activity totaled less than .5 million shares issued.(c)The par value of our preferred stock outstanding was less than $.5 million at each date and, therefore, is excluded from this presentation.(d)Represents the cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-01, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2018-02.

As of September 30, 2018, each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of PNC common stock at an exercise price of $67.016 per share. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, the warrants are exercised on a non-cash net basis with the warrant holder receiving PNC common shares determined based on the excess of the market price of PNC common stock on the exercise date over the exercise price of the warrant. The outstanding warrants will expire as of December 31, 2018 and are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share in Note 10 Earnings Per Share in this Report.On October 4, 2018, PNC declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $.95 per share to shareholders of record as of October 17, 2018. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, the declaration of a dividend in excess of $.66 per share may result in an adjustment to the warrant exercise price and to the warrant share number. As a result of this dividend, the warrant exercise price was reduced from $67.016 to $66.861 per share on October 17, 2018 and the warrant share number remained 1.00.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 77Other Comprehensive IncomeDetails of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows: Table 70: Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)  Three months endedSeptember 30  Nine months endedSeptember 30 In millions20182017  20182017 Net unrealized gains (losses) on non-OTTI securities       Increase in net unrealized gains (losses) on non-OTTI securities$(323)$68  $(1,129)$304 Less: Net gains (losses) realized as a yield adjustment reclassified to investment  securities interest income310  920 Less: Net gains (losses) realized on sales of securities reclassified to noninterest income(2)(3)  (13)3 Net increase (decrease), pre-tax(324)61  (1,125)281 Effect of income taxes73(20)  259(103) Net increase (decrease), after-tax(251)41  (866)178 Net unrealized gains (losses) on OTTI securities       Increase in net unrealized gains (losses) on OTTI securities(1)66  16165 Less: OTTI losses realized on securities reclassified to noninterest income   (1) Less: Net gains (losses) realized on sales of securities reclassified to noninterest income    2 Net increase (decrease), pre-tax (1)66  16164 Effect of income taxes1(22)  (4)(60) Net increase (decrease), after-tax—44  12104 Net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives       Increase in net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives(62)(2)  (317)15 Less: Net gains (losses) realized as a yield adjustment reclassified to loan interest income638  43128 Less: Net gains (losses) realized as a yield adjustment reclassified to investment  securities interest income25  916 Less: Net gains (losses) realized on sales of securities reclassified to noninterest income12  85 Net increase (decrease), pre-tax(71)(47)  (377)(134) Effect of income taxes1717  8749 Net increase (decrease), after-tax(54)(30)  (290)(85) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan adjustments       Net pension and other postretirement benefit activity   66(38) Amortization of actuarial loss (gain) reclassified to other noninterest expense112  336 Amortization of prior service cost (credit) reclassified to other noninterest expense (1)  1(4) Net increase (decrease), pre-tax111  70(6) Effect of income taxes (4)  (16)2 Net increase (decrease), after-tax17  54(4) Other       PNC’s portion of BlackRock’s OCI(22)4  (37)26 Net investment hedge derivatives17(26)  47(76) Foreign currency translation adjustments and other(12)28  (35)82 Net increase (decrease), pre-tax(17)6  (25)32 Effect of income taxes18  (3)18 Net increase (decrease), after-tax(16)14  (28)50 Total other comprehensive income (loss), pre-tax(412)97  (1,441)337 Total other comprehensive income (loss), tax effect92(21)  323(94) Total other comprehensive income (loss), after-tax$(320)$76  $(1,118)$243 78 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 71: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Components  In millions, after-taxNet unrealized gains (losses) on non-OTTI securities Net unrealized gains (losses) on OTTI securities Net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedge derivatives Pension and other postretirement benefit plan adjustments Other Total Balance at June 30, 2017$189 $166 $278 $(564) $(167) $(98) Net activity41 44 (30) 7 14 76 Balance at September 30, 2017$230 $210 $248 $(557) $(153) $(22) Balance at June 30, 2018$(494) $227 $(52) $(489) $(132) $(940) Net activity(251)   (54) 1 (16) (320) Balance at September 30, 2018$(745) $227 $(106) $(488) $(148) $(1,260) Balance at December 31, 2016$52 $106 $333 $(553) $(203) $(265) Net activity178 104 (85) (4) 50 243 Balance at September 30, 2017$230 $210 $248 $(557) $(153) $(22) Balance at December 31, 2017$62 $215 $151 $(446) $(130) $(148) Cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2018-02 (a)59   33 (96) 10 6 Balance at January 1, 2018121 215 184 (542) (120) (142) Net activity(866) 12 (290) 54 (28) (1,118) Balance at September 30, 2018$(745) $227 $(106) $(488) $(148) $(1,260) (a)Represents the cumulative impact of adopting ASU 2018-02 which permits the reclassification to retained earnings of the income tax effects stranded within AOCI. See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies in our First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q for additional detail on this adoption.NOTE 12 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We establish accruals for legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings (“Disclosed Matters,” which are those matters disclosed in this Note 12 as well as those matters disclosed in Note 19 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our 2017 Form 10-K and in Note 12 Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 1 of our first and second quarter 2018 Form 10-Qs (such prior disclosure collectively referred to as “Prior Disclosure”)). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, as of September 30, 2018, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, in an aggregate amount of up to approximately $125 million. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount.As a result of the types of factors described in Note 19 in our 2017 Form 10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as discussed below under “Other.”We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information related to the plaintiff’s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff’s pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual.Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 79Interchange LitigationIn September 2018, in the antitrust lawsuits that have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant-Discount Antitrust Litigation (Master File No. 1:05-md-1720-MKB-JO), the relevant parties entered into an amended definitive agreement to resolve the claims of the class seeking damages. In this amended settlement agreement, the parties agreed, among other things, to the following terms: •An additional settlement payment from all defendants of $900 million, with Visa’s share of the additional settlement payment being $600 million. The additional settlement payment will be added to the approximately $5.3 billion previously paid by the defendants pursuant to the original 2012 settlement agreement.  •Up to $700 million may be returned to the defendants (with up to $467 million to Visa) if more than 15% of class members (by payment volume) opt out of the class. The amount that may be returned to defendants is calculated using a formula based on the payment volume attributable to class members that opt out of the class. If more than 25% of class members (by payment volume) opt out of the class, the defendants may terminate the Amended Settlement Agreement. This amended settlement agreement is subject to court approval.In addition, in August 2018, the district court judge overruled the ruling of magistrate judge that had held that the two-sided market allegations do not relate back to the time of the original complaint and are not subject to tolling. Instead, the district court judge found that the two-sided market allegations do relate back.Pre-need Funeral ArrangementsIn the lawsuit pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri under the caption Jo Ann Howard and Associates, P.C., et al. v. Cassity, et al. (No. 4:09-CV-1252-ERW) a new trial in accordance with the court of appeal’s decision is scheduled to start in November 2018. Other Regulatory and Governmental InquiriesWe are the subject of investigations, audits, examinations and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a broad range of issues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage, securities and other financial services businesses, as well as other aspects of our operations. In some cases, these inquiries are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at PNC individually. From time to time, these inquiries, including those described below and in Prior Disclosure, involve or lead to regulatory enforcement actions and other administrative proceedings, and may lead to civil or criminal judicial proceedings. Some of these inquiries result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs and other consequences. Such remedies and other consequences are not typically material to us from a financial standpoint, but may be and, even if not, may result in significant reputational harm or other adverse consequences. As has been publicly reported, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida is conducting an inquiry relating to the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program directed at program participants. In connection with that inquiry, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has requested information from PNC Bank. We are cooperating with the inquiry. Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries, including those described in this Note 12 and in Prior Disclosure.OtherIn addition to the proceedings or other matters described above, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.80 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QNOTE 13 COMMITMENTSIn the normal course of business, we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table presents our outstanding commitments to extend credit along with significant other commitments as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Table 72: Commitments to Extend Credit and Other Commitments In millionsSeptember 302018 December 312017 Commitments to extend credit    Total commercial lending$118,491 $112,125 Home equity lines of credit16,703 17,852 Credit card26,548 24,911 Other5,174 4,753 Total commitments to extend credit166,916 159,641 Net outstanding standby letters of credit (a)8,828 8,651 Reinsurance agreements (b)1,557 1,654 Standby bond purchase agreements (c)1,018 843 Other commitments (d)1,060 1,732 Total commitments to extend credit and other commitments$179,379 $172,521 (a)Net outstanding standby letters of credit include $3.7 billion and $3.5 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which support remarketing programs.(b)Represents aggregate maximum exposure up to the specified limits of the reinsurance contracts provided by our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. These amounts reflect estimates based on availability of financial information from insurance carriers. As of September 30, 2018, the aggregate maximum exposure amount comprised $1.4 billion for accidental death & dismemberment contracts and $.2 billion for credit life, accident and health contracts. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2017 were $1.5 billion and $.2 billion, respectively.(c)We enter into standby bond purchase agreements to support municipal bond obligations.(d)Includes $.5 billion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.Commitments to Extend CreditCommitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee, and contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates.Net Outstanding Standby Letters of CreditWe issue standby letters of credit and share in the risk of standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to support obligations of our customers to third-parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of transactions involving capital markets product execution. Approximately 92% and 91% of our net outstanding standby letters of credit were rated as Pass as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, with the remainder rated as Criticized. An internal credit rating of Pass indicates the expected risk of loss is currently low, while a rating of Criticized indicates a higher degree of risk.If the customer fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third-party under the terms of the contract or there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them. The standby letters of credit outstanding on September 30, 2018 had terms ranging from less than one year to six years.As of September 30, 2018, assets of $1.1 billion secured certain specifically identified standby letters of credit. In addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit issued on behalf of specific customers is also secured by collateral or guarantees that secure the customers’ other obligations to us. The carrying amount of the liability for our obligations related to standby letters of credit and participations in standby letters of credit was $.2 billion at September 30, 2018 and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 81NOTE 14 SEGMENT REPORTINGWe have four reportable business segments:•Retail Banking•Corporate & Institutional Banking•Asset Management Group•BlackRockResults of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period.Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category in the business segment tables. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, certain trading activities, certain non-strategic runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, most corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, integration costs, exited businesses and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments’ results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Assets, revenue and earnings attributable to foreign activities were not material in the periods presented for comparative purposes.Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the results for corporate support functions within “Other” for financial reporting purposes.Our allocation of the costs incurred by shared support areas not directly aligned with the businesses is primarily based on the use of services.A portion of capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to our business segments using our risk-based economic capital model, including consideration of the goodwill at those business segments, as well as the diversification of risk among the business segments, ultimately reflecting our portfolio risk adjusted capital allocation.We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on the loan exposures within each business segment’s portfolio. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.Business Segment Products and Services Retail Banking provides deposit, lending, brokerage, insurance services, investment management and cash management products and services to consumer and small business customers.

The objective of the standard is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers across all industries and to develop a common revenue standard under GAAP. The standard requires the application of a five-step recognition model to contracts, allocating the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to across distinct promises in the contract, called performance obligations, and recognizing revenue when or as those services are transferred to the customer.Fee-based revenue within the scope of Topic 606 is recognized within three of our reportable business segments, Retail Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking (C&IB) and Asset Management Group. Income recognized from our investment in BlackRock, also a reportable segment, is outside of the scope of the standard. Topic 606 also excludes interest income, income from lease contracts, fair value gains from financial instruments (including derivatives), income from mortgage servicing rights and guarantee products, letter of credit fees, non-refundable fees associated with acquiring or originating a loan and gains from the sale of financial assets.The following tables present noninterest income within the scope of Topic 606 disaggregated by segment. A description of the fee-based revenue and how it is recognized for each segment’s principal services and products follows each table.Table 74: Retail Banking Noninterest Income Disaggregation In millionsThree Months EndedSeptember 30, 2018Nine Months EndedSeptember 30, 2018 Product    Deposit account fees$162$451  Debit card fees130374  Brokerage fees86260  Merchant services54156  Net credit card fees (a)45139  Other71214 Total in-scope noninterest income by product$548$1,594 Reconciliation to total Retail Banking noninterest income   Total in-scope noninterest income $548$1,594 Total out-of-scope noninterest income (b)74341 Total Retail Banking noninterest income$622$1,935 (a)Net credit card fees consists of interchange fees of $115 million and $332 million and credit card reward costs of $70 million and $193 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018, respectively.(b)Out-of-scope noninterest income includes revenue streams that fall under the scope of other accounting and disclosure requirements outside of Topic 606.Deposit Account FeesRetail Banking provides demand deposit, money market and savings account products for consumer and small business customers. Services include online and branch banking, overdraft and wire transfer services, imaging services and cash alternative services such as money orders and cashier's checks. We recognize fee income at the time these services are performed for the customer.Debit Card and Net Credit Card FeesAs an issuing bank, Retail Banking earns interchange fee revenue from debit and credit card transactions. By offering card products, we maintain and administer card-related services such as credit card reward programs, account data and statement information, card activation, renewals, and card suspension and blockage. Interchange fees are earned when cardholders make purchases and are presented net of credit card reward costs.Brokerage FeesRetail Banking earns fee revenue by providing its customers a wide range of investment options through its brokerage services including mutual funds, annuities, stocks, bonds, long-term care and insurance products, and managed accounts. We earn fee revenue for transaction-based brokerage services, such as the execution of market trades, once the transaction has been completed as of the trade date.

The impact of financial derivatives used in interest rate risk management is included in the interest income/expense and average yields/rates of the related assets and liabilities. Basis adjustments related to hedged items are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities. Average balances of securities are based on amortized historical cost (excluding adjustments to fair value, which are included in other assets). Average balances for certain loans and borrowed funds accounted for at fair value are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in Noninterest income.(b)Loan fees for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 were $34 million and $35 million, respectively. Loan fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 were $99 million and $89 million, respectfully.(c)Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. See Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income in this Statistical Information section for more information.88 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QRECONCILIATION OF TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME (NON-GAAP) (a)   Nine months ended Three months ended In millions September 30, 2018 September 30, 2017 September 30, 2018 September 30, 2017 Net interest income (GAAP) $7,240 $6,763 $2,466 $2,345 Taxable-equivalent adjustments 87 161 29 55 Net interest income (Non-GAAP) $7,327 $6,924 $2,495 $2,400 (a)The interest income earned on certain interest-earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest income, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted into law during the fourth quarter of 2017, the statutory tax rate for corporations was lowered to 21% from 35%, effective January 1, 2018. Amounts for the 2017 periods were calculated using the previously applicable statutory federal income tax rate of 35%.TRANSITIONAL BASEL III AND FULLY PHASED-IN BASEL III COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIOS (NON-GAAP) 2017 Transitional Basel III (a) Fully Phased-In Basel III(Non-GAAP) (b) Dollars in millionsSeptember 302017 September 302017 Common stock, related surplus and retained earnings, net of treasury stock$42,426 $42,426 Less regulatory capital adjustments:    Goodwill and disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities(9,137) (9,202) Basel III total threshold deductions(1,166) (1,731) Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (c)(94) (117) All other adjustments(161) (163) Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital$31,868 $31,213 Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets (d)$309,292 $317,393 Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets (e)N/A $285,517 Basel III Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio10.3% 9.8% Risk weight and associated rules utilizedStandardized (with 2017 transition adjustments) Standardized (a)Calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during 2017 and calculated based on the standardized approach.(b)2017 Fully Phased-In Basel III results are presented as Pro forma estimates.(c)Represents net adjustments related to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for securities currently, and those transferred from, available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans.
