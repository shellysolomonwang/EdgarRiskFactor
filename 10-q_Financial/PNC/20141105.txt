Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation, which we believe is more meaningful to readers of our consolidated financial statements.    (a) The Executive Summary and Consolidated Income Statement Review portions of the Financial Review section of this Report provide information regarding items impacting the comparability of the periods presented.    (b) Amounts for 2013 periods have been updated to reflect the first quarter 2014 adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-01 related to investments in low income housing tax credits.    (c) We believe that pretax, pre-provision earnings, a non-GAAP measure, is useful as a tool to help evaluate the ability to provide for credit costs through operations.    (d) Calculated as annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins for all earning assets, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the Consolidated Income Statement. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 were $47 million and $43 million, respectively. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 were $140 million and $123 million, respectively.

PNC has businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management and residential mortgage banking, providing many of its products and services nationally, as well as other products and services in PNC’s primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Alabama, Virginia, Missouri, Georgia, Wisconsin and South Carolina. PNC also provides certain products and services internationally.  Key Strategic Goals  At PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and fee revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our corporate responsibility to the communities where we do business.  We strive to expand and deepen customer relationships by offering a broad range of deposit, fee-based and credit products and services. We are focused on delivering those products and services where, when and how our customers choose with the goal of offering insight that reflects their specific needs. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships that meet our risk/return measures. Our strategies for growing fee income across our lines of business are focused on achieving deeper market penetration and cross selling our diverse product mix.  Our strategic priorities are designed to enhance value over the long term. A key priority is to drive growth in acquired and underpenetrated markets, including in the Southeast. In addition, we are seeking to attract more of the investable assets of new and existing clients. PNC is focused on redefining our retail banking business to a more customer-centric and sustainable model while lowering delivery costs as customer banking preferences evolve. We are also working to build a stronger residential mortgage banking business with the goal of becoming the provider of choice for our customers. Additionally, we continue to focus on expense management while bolstering critical infrastructure and streamlining our processes.  Our capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework and return excess capital to shareholders, in accordance with the capital plan included in our 2014 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and   Review (CCAR) submission to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). We continue to improve our capital levels and ratios through retention of earnings and expect to build capital through retention of future earnings net of dividend payments and share repurchases. PNC continues to maintain adequate liquidity positions at both PNC and PNC Bank, National Association (PNC Bank, N.A.). For more detail, see the Capital and Liquidity Actions portion of this Executive Summary, the Funding and Capital Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section and the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2013 Form 10-K.  PNC faces a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. The extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current economic, political and regulatory environment, merger and acquisition activity and operational challenges. Many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail in our 2013 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Report.  Recent Market and Industry Developments  There have been numerous legislative and regulatory developments and significant changes in the competitive landscape of our industry over the last several years. The United States and other governments have undertaken major reform of the regulation of the financial services industry, including engaging in new efforts to impose requirements designed to strengthen the stability of the financial system and protect consumers and investors. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), enacted in July 2010, mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Many parts of the law are now in effect, and others are now in the implementation stage, which is likely to continue for several years. We expect to face further increased regulation of our industry as a result of Dodd-Frank as well as other current and future initiatives intended to enhance the regulation of financial services companies, the stability of the financial system, the protection of consumers and investors, and the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets. We also expect in many cases more intense scrutiny from our supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of laws and regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with new regulations will increase our costs and reduce our revenue. Some new regulations may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.  On September 2, 2014, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) finalized enforceable guidelines that establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework at large insured national banks, including PNC Bank, N.A. The     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 3    Table of Contents   guidelines describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk management, internal audit, and the board of directors, and provide that a bank should have a comprehensive written statement that articulates its risk appetite and serves as a basis for the framework (i.e., a risk appetite statement). In accordance with the guidelines’ phased-in compliance dates, PNC Bank, N.A. is required to be in compliance with the guidelines by May 10, 2015.  New and evolving capital and liquidity standards will have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking agencies released final rules to implement the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is a quantitative liquidity standard included in the international Basel III framework. The LCR rules are designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of cash and high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA) to meet estimated net liquidity needs in a short-term stress scenario using liquidity inflow and outflow assumptions provided in the rules (net cash outflow). An institution’s LCR is the amount of its HQLA, as defined and calculated in accordance with the haircuts and limitations in the rule, divided by its net cash outflow, with the quotient expressed as a percentage.  Top-tier bank holding companies (like PNC) that are subject to the advanced approaches for regulatory capital purposes, as well as any subsidiary depository institution of such a company that has $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets (such as PNC Bank, N.A.), are subject to the full LCR (rather than the less stringent modified LCR) under the final rules effective on January 1, 2015. However, the minimum required LCR and the requirement to calculate the LCR on a daily basis will be phased-in over a period of years. For example, the minimum LCR PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. will be required to maintain in 2015 is 80%, increases to 90% in 2016 and, when fully phased-in in 2017, will be 100%. PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. will be required to calculate the LCR on a monthly basis until June 30, 2016. Beginning on July 1, 2016, and thereafter, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. will be required to calculate the LCR on a daily basis. PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. expect to exceed the initial LCR phase-in requirement when it becomes effective on January 1, 2015.  On October 17, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued final rules adopting amendments to its capital plan and stress testing rules. Under these amendments, the schedule for the annual CCAR and Dodd-Frank stress test (DFAST) process will be modified effective January 1, 2016. Beginning in 2016, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as PNC, are required to submit their annual capital plans and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5th of each year (rather than by January 5th as currently required). In order to transition to this new schedule, the Federal Reserve has indicated that its non-  objection to a capital plan submitted in January 2015 would cover proposed capital actions for the five quarter period from the second quarter of 2015 through and including the second quarter of 2016. Under the new schedule, the Federal Reserve will release its decisions on the capital plans submitted and release the results of its supervisory stress test by June 30th, approximately three months later than current practice. The amendments also shift the schedule for the company-run mid-cycle DFAST stress tests, with PNC’s submission date for these tests shifting to October 5th (from July 5th) and the release date for company results moving to October (from September).  On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs in NACS, et al. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The decision vacated the debit card interchange and network processing rules that went into effect in October 2011 and that were adopted by the Federal Reserve to implement provisions of Dodd-Frank. The district court found among other things that the debit card interchange fees permitted under the rules allowed card issuers to recover costs that were not permitted by the statute. In March 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the district court. It upheld the Federal Reserve’s network processing rule and upheld its interchange fee rule except as to the issue of transaction monitoring costs, and remanded that issue back to the Federal Reserve for further explanation. In August 2014, the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the court of appeals’ decision.  In October 2014, six federal agencies (the Federal Reserve, OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development) adopted final rules to implement the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of Dodd-Frank for asset-backed securitization transactions. The regulations specify when and how securitizers of different types of asset-backed securitizations, including transactions backed by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, and commercial, credit card and auto loans, must comply with the Dodd-Frank requirement that they retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets being securitized. The final rules also implement the exemptions from these credit risk retention requirements for transactions that are backed by “qualified residential mortgages” or other high-quality commercial mortgage, commercial or automobile loans, each as defined in the final rules. The regulations will take effect one year after publication in the Federal Register (which is expected in November 2014) with respect to new securitization transactions backed by residential mortgages and two years after publication in the Federal Register with respect to new securitization transactions backed by other types of assets. The final rules are likely to have an impact on PNC both directly, due to its role in certain types of securitization transactions, as     4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents   well as indirectly, by impacting the markets for loans that PNC originates and securitizes, although the extent and magnitude of these impacts is not yet known and will, to some extent, depend on how the markets and market participants (including PNC) adjust to the new rules. For more information on the potential direct and indirect impact of the rules on PNC, see Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2013 Form 10-K.  For additional information concerning recent legislative and regulatory developments, as well as certain governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations that may affect PNC, please see the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors, Recent Market and Industry Developments in the Executive Summary section of Item 7, and Note 23 Legal Proceedings and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K and Recent Market and Industry Developments in the Executive Summary section of our First Quarter 2014 Form 10-Q and Second Quarter 2014 Form 10-Q, as well as Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Key Factors Affecting Financial Performance  Our financial performance is substantially affected by a number of external factors outside of our control, including the following:      •    General economic conditions, including the continuity, speed and stamina of the current U.S. economic expansion in general and on our customers in particular,      •    The monetary policy actions and statements of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),      •    The level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in, interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve,      •    The functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, the capital and other financial markets,      •    Loan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit, and asset quality,      •    Customer demand for non-loan products and services,      •    Changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape and in counterparty creditworthiness and performance as the financial services industry restructures in the current environment,      •    The impact of the extensive reforms enacted in the Dodd-Frank legislation and other legislative, regulatory and administrative initiatives and actions, including those outlined elsewhere in this Report, in our 2013 Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings, and      •    The impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations.  In addition, our success will depend upon, among other things:      •    Focused execution of strategic priorities for organic customer growth opportunities,      •    Further success in growing profitability through the acquisition and retention of customers and deepening relationships,      •    Driving growth in acquired and underpenetrated geographic markets, including our Southeast markets,      •    Our ability to effectively manage PNC’s balance sheet and generate net interest income,      •    Revenue growth from fee income and our ability to provide innovative and valued products to our customers,      •    Our ability to utilize technology to develop and deliver products and services to our customers and protect PNC’s systems and customer information,      •    Our ability to bolster our critical infrastructure and streamline our core processes,      •    Our ability to manage and implement strategic business objectives within the changing regulatory environment,      •    A sustained focus on expense management,      •    Improving our overall asset quality,      •    Managing the non-strategic assets portfolio and impaired assets,      •    Continuing to maintain and grow our deposit base as a low-cost funding source,      •    Prudent risk and capital management related to our efforts to manage risk to acceptable levels and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards,      •    Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets,      •    The impact of legal and regulatory-related contingencies, and      •    The appropriateness of reserves needed for critical accounting estimates and related contingencies.  For additional information, please see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2013 Form 10-K.  Income Statement Highlights        •    Net income for the third quarter of 2014 was $1.0 billion, or $1.79 per diluted common share, compared to $1.0 billion, or $1.77 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2013. Net income increased $10 million in the comparison, as a 2% reduction in noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses were mostly offset by a 2% decline in total revenue. For additional detail, see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section in this Financial Review.      •    Net interest income of $2.1 billion for the third quarter of 2014 decreased 6% compared with the third quarter of 2013, primarily driven by lower     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 5    Table of Contents          purchase accounting accretion and lower yields on loans and investment securities, partially offset by the impact of commercial and commercial real estate loan growth.      •    Net interest margin decreased to 2.98% for the third quarter of 2014 compared to 3.47% for the third quarter of 2013. The decline reflected the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion, lower loan and securities yields in the ongoing low rate environment, and the impact of higher interest-earning deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank.      •    Noninterest income of $1.7 billion for the third quarter of 2014 increased 3% compared to the third quarter of 2013, as strong fee income growth was partially offset by declines in residential mortgage loan sales revenue, reductions in asset valuations and lower gains on asset sales.      •    The provision for credit losses decreased to $55 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared to $137 million for the third quarter of 2013 due to overall credit quality improvement.      •    Noninterest expense of $2.4 billion for the third quarter of 2014 decreased 2% compared with the third quarter of 2013 reflecting well managed expenses and the impact of the third quarter 2013 noncash charge related to redemption of trust preferred securities.  Credit Quality Highlights        •    Overall credit quality continued to improve during the first nine months of 2014. For additional detail, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.      •    Nonperforming assets decreased $.5 billion, or 14%, to $3.0 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.89% at September 30, 2014, compared to 1.08% at December 31, 2013.      •    Overall loan delinquencies of $2.0 billion at September 30, 2014 decreased $.5 billion, or 19%, compared with December 31, 2013.      •    The allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.70% of total loans and 130% of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2014, compared with 1.84% and 117% at December 31, 2013, respectively.      •    Net charge-offs of $82 million were down 63% compared to net charge-offs of $224 million for the third quarter of 2013. Annualized net charge-offs were 0.16% of average loans in the third quarter of 2014 and 0.47% of average loans in the third quarter of 2013. For the first nine months of 2014, net charge-offs were $413 million, and 0.28% of average loans on an annualized basis, compared with $888 million and 0.63% for the first nine months of 2013, respectively. The year-to-date comparisons were impacted by alignment with interagency guidance in          the first quarter of 2013 on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending. In the first quarter 2013, this alignment had the overall effect of (i) accelerating charge-offs, (ii) increasing nonperforming loans and (iii) in the case of loans accounted for under the fair value option, increasing nonaccrual loans. See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for further detail.  Balance Sheet Highlights        •    Total loans increased by $5.3 billion to $201 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013.      •   Total commercial lending increased by $6.9 billion, or 6%, as a result of growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans to new and existing customers.      •   Total consumer lending decreased $1.7 billion, or 2%, due to lower home equity, residential mortgage and education loans partially offset by growth in automobile loans.      •    Total deposits increased by $5.4 billion to $226 billion at September 30, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013, driven by growth in transaction deposits.      •    PNC further increased its liquidity position as reflected in higher deposit balances maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank and expects to exceed the phase-in requirement of the short-term liquidity coverage ratio when it becomes effective for PNC as an advanced approaches bank beginning January 1, 2015.      •    PNC’s well-positioned balance sheet remained core funded with a loans to deposits ratio of 89% at September 30, 2014.      •    The Transitional Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during 2014, increased to 11.1% at September 30, 2014.      •    Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to an estimated 10.1% at September 30, 2014 from 9.4% at December 31, 2013 based on the standardized approach rules. See the Capital discussion and Table 18 in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review and the December 31, 2013 capital ratio tables in the Statistical Information section of this Report for more detail.  Our Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet Review sections of this Financial Review describe in greater detail the various items that impacted our results during the first nine months of 2014 and 2013 and balances at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.     6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  Capital and Liquidity Actions  Our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends or to repurchase shares under current or future programs, is subject to the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy undertaken by the Federal Reserve and our primary bank regulators as part of the CCAR process.  In connection with the 2014 CCAR, PNC submitted its 2014 capital plan, approved by its Board of Directors, to the Federal Reserve in January 2014. As we announced on March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve accepted the capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions, which included a recommendation to increase the quarterly common stock dividend in the second quarter of 2014. The capital plan also included share repurchase programs of up to $1.5 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the second quarter of 2014 under PNC’s existing common stock repurchase authorization. These programs include repurchases of up to   $200 million to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions. In the second and third quarters of 2014, in accordance with the 2014 capital plan, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock on the open market, with an average price of $85.55 per share and an aggregate repurchase price of $583 million. For additional information concerning the CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in evaluating capital plans, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2013 Form 10-K.  On April 3, 2014, consistent with our 2014 capital plan, our Board of Directors approved an increase to PNC’s quarterly common stock dividend from 44 cents per common share to 48 cents per common share beginning with the May 5, 2014 dividend payment.  See the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our 2014 capital and liquidity actions.

The Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review provides information on changes in selected Consolidated Balance Sheet categories at September 30, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013. Total assets were $334.4 billion at September 30, 2014 compared with $320.2 billion at December 31, 2013.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 7    Table of Contents  Average investment securities declined in the comparison of the first nine months of 2014 with the first nine months of 2013, as a net decrease in average residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities from principal payments was partially offset by an increase in average U.S. Treasury and government agencies securities, which was largely driven by purchases to enhance our liquidity position. Total investment securities comprised 20% of average interest-earning assets for the first nine months of 2014 and 22% for the first nine months of 2013.  The increase in average total loans in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the first nine months of 2013 was driven by increases in average commercial loans of $6.0 billion, average commercial real estate loans of $3.4 billion and average consumer loans of $.9 billion. The overall increase in loans reflected organic loan growth, primarily in our Corporate & Institutional Banking segment.  Loans represented 71% of average interest-earning assets for the first nine months of 2014 and 73% of average interest-earning assets for the first nine months of 2013.  Average interest-earning deposits with banks, which are primarily maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank, increased significantly in the comparison to the prior year period as we continued to enhance our liquidity position.  The decrease in average noninterest-earning assets in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the first nine months of 2013 was primarily driven by decreased unsettled securities sales and securities valuations, both of which are included in noninterest-earning assets for average balance sheet purposes.  Average total deposits increased $10.2 billion to $220.7 billion in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to an increase of $11.9 billion in average transaction deposits, which grew to $186.8 billion for the first nine months of 2014. Higher average money market deposits, average noninterest-bearing deposits and average interest-bearing demand deposits drove the increase in both commercial and consumer average transaction deposits. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.7 billion in average retail certificates of deposit attributable to runoff of maturing accounts. Total deposits at September 30, 2014 were $226.3 billion compared with $220.9 billion at December 31, 2013 and are further discussed within the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.  Average total deposits represented 68% of average total assets for the first nine months of 2014 and 70% for the first nine months of 2013.  The increase in average borrowed funds in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the first nine months of 2013 was primarily due to increases in average Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings and average bank notes and senior debt, in part to enhance our liquidity position. These increases were partially offset by a decline in average commercial paper. Total borrowed funds at September 30, 2014 were $52.3 billion compared with $46.1 billion at December 31, 2013 and are further discussed within the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review. The Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding our sources and uses of borrowed funds.     8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents Business Segment Highlights  Total business segment earnings were $3.0 billion for the first nine months of 2014 and 2013.

Additional detail is included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review and in Note 18 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.    (d) The decrease in revenue in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the first nine months of 2013 for “Other” reflected a decline in net interest income primarily due to decreased investment securities income and higher borrowed funds expense, while the decline in noninterest income was more than offset by a decrease in noninterest expense.    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 9    Table of Contents  CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW  Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Net income was $3.2 billion for the first nine months of 2014, an increase of $12 million compared to the first nine months of 2013, as a 3% reduction in noninterest expense and significantly lower provision for credit losses were mostly offset by a 4% decline in total revenue, driven by lower net interest income and slightly lower noninterest income.  Third quarter 2014 net income increased $10 million to $1.0 billion, compared with third quarter 2013. A 2% decrease in noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses were largely offset by a 2% decline in total revenue. The decrease in revenue resulted from lower net interest income, which was partially offset by a 3% increase in noninterest income.  Net Interest Income   Table 4: Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin                            Nine months endedSeptember 30     Three months endedSeptember 30    Dollars in millions   2014     2013     2014     2013     Net interest income   $ 6,428     $ 6,881     $ 2,104     $ 2,234     Net interest margin     3.12 %      3.62 %      2.98 %      3.47 %   Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion on purchased impaired loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review for additional information.  Net interest income decreased by $453 million, or 7%, in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the prior year period, including a decline of $130 million, or 6%, in the third quarter comparison. The decreases in both comparisons were primarily due to lower purchase accounting accretion and lower yields on loans and investment securities, partially offset by the impact of commercial and commercial real estate loan growth. The declines also reflected the impact from the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to noninterest income. Lower investment securities balances in both comparisons also contributed to the decline.  Lower net interest margins in both comparisons were driven by 52 basis point and 49 basis point declines in the yields on total interest-earning assets in both the year-to-date and quarterly comparisons, respectively, which included the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion, continued spread compression, and repricing of new and existing loans and securities in a lower rate environment. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities remained relatively stable in both comparisons.  The declines in total interest-earning asset yields, in both comparisons, primarily reflected lower yields on new and repricing loans in the ongoing low rate environment, the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees and the impact of higher interest-earning deposits maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank. Both comparisons also reflected lower yields on the investment securities portfolio.  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect net interest income to be down modestly due to the continued decline in purchase accounting accretion and further interest rate spread compression related to loans and investment securities.  For full year 2014, we expect total purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $275 million compared with 2013. In 2015, we expect purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $225 million compared to 2014.     10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents Noninterest Income  Table 5: Noninterest Income                                            Nine months ended September 30     Three months ended September 30                    Change           Change    Dollars in millions   2014     2013     $     %     2014     2013     $     %     Noninterest income                                            Asset management   $ 1,137     $ 978     $  159       16 %    $ 411     $ 330     $ 81       25 %    Consumer services     933       926       7       1 %      320       316       4       1 %    Corporate services     1,018       909       109       12 %      374       306       68       22 %    Residential mortgage     483       600       (117 )      (20 )%      140       199       (59 )      (30 )%    Service charges on deposits     482       439       43       10 %      179       156       23       15 %    Net gains on sales of securities     4       96       (92 )      (96 )%      –       21       (21 )      (100 )%    Net other-than-temporary impairments     (4 )      (16 )      12       75 %      (1 )      (2 )      1       50 %    Other     947       1,126       (179 )      (16 )%      314       360       (46 )      (13 )%    Total noninterest income   $ 5,000     $ 5,058     $ (58 )      (1 )%    $ 1,737     $ 1,686     $  51       3 %     Noninterest income decreased in the comparison to the first nine months of 2013 as strong fee income growth was more than offset by declines in residential mortgage loan sales revenue, reductions in asset valuations and lower gains on asset sales. In the quarterly comparison, noninterest income increased in the current quarter, as the strong growth in fee income was only partially offset by the declines in residential mortgage loan sales revenue, asset valuations and gains on asset sales.  Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 44% for the first nine months of 2014, up from 42% for the first nine months of 2013. The comparable amounts for the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 were 45% and 43%, respectively.  Asset management revenue increased in both comparisons due to increased earnings from our BlackRock investment, stronger average equity markets in the respective periods and positive net flows, after adjustments for cyclical client activities. Discretionary client assets under management increased to $132 billion at September 30, 2014 compared with $122 billion at September 30, 2013 driven by higher equity markets, new sales and positive net flows.  Consumer service fees increased slightly in both the year-to-date and third quarter comparisons, primarily due to growth in customer-initiated transaction volumes that was mostly offset by several individually insignificant items.  Corporate services revenue increased to $1.0 billion for the first nine months of 2014, including $374 million in the third quarter of 2014, compared to $.9 billion for the first nine months of 2013, which included $306 million for the third quarter of 2013. The comparisons reflected higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to noninterest income. These increases were partially offset by lower net commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation gains, which were $33   million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to $73 million for the first nine months of 2013. The respective gain amount for the third quarter of 2013 was $18 million, while the amount for the third quarter of 2014 was not significant.  Residential mortgage revenue decreased to $483 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $600 million in the first nine months of 2013. In the third quarter 2014 comparison, residential mortgage revenue declined to $140 million compared with $199 million in the third quarter of 2013. Both comparisons included lower loan sales revenue from a reduction in origination volume and lower net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by higher loan servicing fee revenue. The decline in loan sales revenue in the year-to-date comparison was partially offset by the impact of second quarter 2014 gains on sales of previously underperforming portfolio loans.  In addition, the overall decline in residential mortgage revenue for the first nine months of 2014 was partially offset by the impact of improvement in the provision for residential mortgage repurchase obligations, which was a small benefit for the first nine months of 2014 compared to a provision of $71 million in the prior year period. The respective amounts in the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 were not significant.  Service charges on deposits increased in both comparisons to the prior year periods due to growth in customer-initiated transactions and changes in product offerings.  Other noninterest income decreased to $.9 billion for the first nine months of 2014 compared with $1.1 billion for the first nine months of 2013. Third quarter 2014 other noninterest income declined to $314 million compared to $360 million for the third quarter of 2013. Both declines were driven by lower asset valuations and reduced overall gains on sale of other assets, partially offset by higher revenue associated with private equity investments. The year-to-date comparison also reflected lower revenue from a decline in the market value of investments related to deferred compensation obligations.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 11    Table of Contents  The declines in asset valuations in the nine months period comparison included lower revenue from credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities due to lower market interest rates impacting the fair value of PNC’s credit exposure on these activities, which resulted in a loss of $15 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to income of $40 million for the first nine months of 2013. The impacts to both the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 were not significant.  Other noninterest income in the first nine months of 2014 included gains of $173 million on sales of 3 million shares of Visa Class B common shares, compared to $168 million of gains on sales of 4 million shares in the first nine months of 2013. The comparable amounts for the third quarters of 2014 and 2013 were gains of $57 million and $85 million on sales of 1 million and 2 million shares, respectively. At September 30, we held approximately 7 million Visa Class B common shares with a fair value of approximately $648 million and a recorded investment of approximately $89 million.  Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Further details regarding our customer-related trading activities are included in the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review. Further details regarding private and other equity investments are included in the Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk section, and further details regarding gains or losses related to our equity investment in BlackRock are included in the Business Segments Review section.  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect fee-based noninterest income to remain stable as we anticipate seasonal growth and higher fee-based business activity to offset an expected fourth quarter decline in anticipated merger and acquisition advisory fees compared to the third quarter.  Provision For Credit Losses  The provision for credit losses totaled $221 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared with $530 million for the first nine months of 2013 and was $55 million for the third quarter of 2014 compared with $137 million for the third quarter of 2013. The decreases in provision reflected improved overall credit quality, including lower consumer loan delinquencies. A contributing economic factor in the nine month comparison was the increasing value of residential real estate, which improved expected cash flows from our purchased impaired loans.  Assuming a continuation of current credit trends, we expect our provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2014 to be between $25 million and $75 million.  The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.  Noninterest Expense  Noninterest expense decreased $218 million, or 3%, to $6.9 billion for the first nine months of 2014 compared to the prior year period, reflecting overall disciplined expense management. The decline was driven by a decrease in personnel expense related to lower headcount and benefits costs and the impacts of a first quarter 2013 contribution to the PNC Foundation and noncash charges for unamortized discounts of $57 million related to redemption of trust preferred securities in the first nine months of 2013.  Noninterest expense was $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2014, a decline of $37 million, or 2%, compared with third quarter 2013. The decrease reflected well-controlled expenses and the impact of the third quarter 2013 noncash charge related to redemption of trust preferred securities of $27 million. These declines were partially offset by investments in technology and infrastructure.  In the first nine months of 2014, we have completed actions to achieve our full year 2014 continuous improvement savings goal of $500 million. These cost savings are funding investments in our infrastructure, including those related to cybersecurity, and investments in our diversified businesses, including our Retail Banking transformation, consistent with our strategic priorities.  For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect noninterest expense to increase by low single digits, on a percentage basis, compared to third quarter 2014 related to expected seasonally higher fourth quarter expenses and as we continue to invest in our businesses and infrastructure. We expect to partially offset these increases with expected cost savings from our continuous improvement savings program.  Effective Income Tax Rate  The effective income tax rate was 26.0% in both the first nine months of 2014 and 2013. For the third quarter of 2014, our effective income tax rate was 27.4% compared with 26.0% for the third quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits PNC receives from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments.  The higher effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2013 was primarily attributable to the 2013 tax benefit recognized by asserting that earnings of the Luxembourg-UK lending business were indefinitely reinvested.  The effective tax rate for both the 2014 and 2013 periods reflects the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-01, which relates to amortization of investments in low income housing tax credits. See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further detail. The retrospective application of this guidance resulted in increased income tax expenses in both periods due to the reclassification of noninterest expense associated with these investments.     12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW  Table 6: Summarized Balance Sheet Data                             September 30 2014      December 31 2013     Change    Dollars in millions       $     %     Assets                        Interest-earning deposits with banks   $ 26,247     $ 12,135     $ 14,112       116 %    Loans held for sale     2,143       2,255       (112 )      (5 )%    Investment securities     55,039       60,294       (5,255 )      (9 )%    Loans     200,872       195,613       5,259       3 %    Allowance for loan and lease losses     (3,406 )      (3,609 )      203       6 %    Goodwill     9,074       9,074       –       – %    Other intangible assets     1,994       2,216       (222 )      (10 )%    Other, net     42,461       42,214       247       1 %    Total assets   $ 334,424     $ 320,192     $ 14,232       4 %    Liabilities                        Deposits   $ 226,304     $ 220,931     $ 5,373       2 %    Borrowed funds     52,327       46,105       6,222       13 %    Other     9,798       9,119       679       7 %    Total liabilities     288,429       276,155       12,274       4 %    Equity                        Total shareholders’ equity     44,481       42,334       2,147       5 %    Noncontrolling interests     1,514       1,703       (189 )      (11 )%    Total equity     45,995       44,037       1,958       4 %    Total liabilities and equity   $ 334,424     $ 320,192     $ 14,232       4 %     The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  The increase in total assets was primarily due to higher interest-earning deposits with banks and loan growth, partially offset by lower investment securities. The increase in interest-earning deposits with banks was driven by higher deposit balances maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank in part due to regulatory short-term liquidity standards that begin to be phased in starting January 1, 2015. Interest-earning deposits with banks included balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland of $25.9 billion and $11.7 billion at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The increase in liabilities was largely due to growth in deposits and higher Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and issuances of bank notes and senior debt and subordinated debt, partially offset by a decline in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements. An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows.  Loans  Outstanding loan balances of $200.9 billion at September 30, 2014 and $195.6 billion at December 31, 2013 were net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees, unamortized discounts and premiums, and purchase discounts and premiums totaling $1.8 billion at September 30, 2014 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2013, respectively. The balances include purchased impaired loans but do not include future accretable net interest (i.e., the difference between the undiscounted expected cash flows and the carrying value of the loan) on those loans.

(b) Includes both construction loans and intermediate financing for projects.    (c) Construction loans with interest reserves and A/B Note restructurings are not significant to PNC.    The increase in loans was driven by the increase in commercial lending as a result of growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans, primarily from new customers and organic growth. The decline in consumer lending resulted from lower home equity, residential mortgage and education loans, partially offset by growth in automobile loans.  Loans represented 60% of total assets at September 30, 2014 and 61% at December 31, 2013. Commercial lending represented 62% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2014 and 60% at December 31, 2013. Consumer lending represented 38% of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2014 and 40% at December 31, 2013.    Commercial real estate loans represented 11% of total loans at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 and represented 7% of total assets at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our loan portfolio.  Total loans above include purchased impaired loans of $5.2 billion, or 3% of total loans, at September 30, 2014, and $6.1 billion, or 3% of total loans, at December 31, 2013.  Our loan portfolio continued to be diversified among numerous industries, types of businesses and consumers across our principal geographic markets.     14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL)  Our total ALLL of $3.4 billion at September 30, 2014 consisted of $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. The ALLL included what we believe to be appropriate loss coverage on all loans, including higher risk loans, in the commercial and consumer portfolios. We do not consider government insured or guaranteed loans to be higher risk as defaults have historically been materially mitigated by payments of insurance or guarantee amounts for approved claims. Additional information regarding our higher risk loans is included in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and Note 1 Accounting Policies, Note 4 Asset Quality and Note 6 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

(b) As of September 30, 2014, we estimate that $1.8 billion of accretable interest on purchased credit impaired loans will be recognized in future interest income, $1.0 billion of which is expected to be contractual interest.

We currently expect to collect total cash flows of $6.1 billion on purchased impaired loans, representing the $4.3 billion net investment at September 30, 2014 and the accretable net interest of $1.8 billion shown in Table 9.  Weighted Average Life of the Purchased Impaired Portfolios  The table below provides the weighted average life (WAL) for each of the purchased impaired portfolios as of September 30, 2014.

(b) Portfolio primarily consists of nonrevolving home equity products.    (c) In 2014, the weighted average life of the purchased impaired portfolio increased, primarily driven by residential real estate. Increasing a portfolio’s weighted average life may result in more interest income being recognized on purchased impaired loans in future periods.  Purchased Impaired Loans – Accretable Difference Sensitivity Analysis  The following table provides a sensitivity analysis on the Total Purchased Impaired Loans portfolio. The analysis reflects hypothetical changes in key drivers for expected cash flows over the life of the loans under declining and improving conditions at a point in time. Any unusual significant economic events or changes, as well as other variables not considered below (e.g., natural or widespread disasters), could result in impacts outside of the ranges represented below. Additionally, commercial and commercial real estate loan settlements or sales proceeds can vary widely from appraised values due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, special use considerations, liquidity premiums and improvements/deterioration in other income sources.   Table 12: Accretable Difference Sensitivity – Total Purchased Impaired Loans                    In billions    September 30, 2014      Declining Scenario (a)      Improving Scenario (b)     Expected cash flows   $ 6.1       $(.1 )    $ .3     Accretable difference     1.8       –       .1     Allowance for loan and lease losses     (.9 )      (.1 )      .2      (a) Declining Scenario – Reflects hypothetical changes that would decrease future cash flow expectations. For consumer loans, we assume home price forecast decreases by ten percent and unemployment rate forecast increases by two percentage points; for commercial loans, we assume that collateral values decrease by ten percent.     16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents    (b) Improving Scenario – Reflects hypothetical changes that would increase future cash flow expectations. For consumer loans, we assume home price forecast increases by ten percent, unemployment rate forecast decreases by two percentage points and interest rate forecast increases by two percentage points; for commercial loans, we assume that collateral values increase by ten percent.  The present value impact of declining cash flows is primarily reflected as an immediate impairment charge to the provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The present value impact of increased cash flows is first recognized as a reversal of the allowance with any additional cash flow increases reflected as an increase in accretable yield over the life of the loan.  Net Unfunded Credit Commitments  Net unfunded credit commitments are comprised of the following:  Table 13: Net Unfunded Loan Commitments                In millions   September 302014     December 312013     Total commercial lending (a)   $ 96,815     $ 90,104     Home equity lines of credit     18,029       18,754     Credit card     17,659       16,746     Other     4,292       4,266     Total   $ 136,795     $ 129,870      (a) Less than 5% of net unfunded loan commitments relate to commercial real estate at each date.  Commitments to extend credit represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions.  Standby bond purchase agreements totaled $1.1 billion at September 30, 2014 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2013 and are included in the preceding table, primarily within the Total commercial lending category.  In addition to the credit commitments set forth in the table above, our net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $10.2 billion at September 30, 2014 and $10.5 billion at December 31, 2013. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur.  Information regarding our allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Investment Securities  The following table presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio. We have included credit ratings information because the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. For those securities, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represented other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI), we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.2 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 17    Table of Contents  Investment securities represented 16% of total assets at September 30, 2014 and 19% at December 31, 2013.  We evaluate our investment securities portfolio in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps to improve our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well-diversified and of high quality. At September 30, 2014, 85% of the securities in the portfolio were rated AAA/AA, with U.S. Treasury and government agencies, agency residential mortgage-backed and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities collectively representing 59% of the portfolio.  The investment securities portfolio includes both available for sale and held to maturity securities. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses, representing the difference between amortized cost and fair value, included in Shareholders’ equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. As of September 30, 2014, the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities totaled $42.6 billion and $43.6 billion, respectively, compared to an amortized cost and fair value as of December 31, 2013 of $48.0 billion and $48.6 billion, respectively. The amortized cost and fair value of held to maturity securities were $11.4 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively, at September 30, 2014, compared to $11.7 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2013.  The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. Net unrealized gains in the total investment securities portfolio increased to $1.3 billion at September 30, 2014 from $.7 billion at December 31, 2013 primarily due to the impact of market interest rates and credit spreads. The comparable amounts for the securities available for sale portfolio were $1.0 billion and $.6 billion, respectively.  Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities do not impact liquidity. However these gains and losses do affect risk-based capital under the regulatory capital rules in effect beginning in 2014 for PNC. Also, a change in the securities’ credit ratings could impact the liquidity of the securities and may be indicative of a change in credit quality, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules in effect for 2014. In addition, the amount representing the credit-related portion of OTTI on available for sale securities would reduce our earnings and regulatory capital ratios.  During the second quarter of 2014, we transferred securities with a fair value of $1.4 billion from available for sale to held to maturity. We changed our intent and committed to hold these high-quality securities to maturity in order to reduce the impact of price volatility on Accumulated other comprehensive income and certain capital measures, after taking into consideration market conditions and regulatory capital requirements under Basel III capital standards. See additional discussion of this transfer in Note 7 Investment Securities in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this Report.  The duration of investment securities was 2.4 years at September 30, 2014. We estimate that, at September 30, 2014, the effective duration of investment securities was 2.5 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2013 were 3.0 years and 2.8 years, respectively.  At least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on all securities. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether the loss represents OTTI. For debt securities that we neither intend to sell nor believe we will be required to sell prior to expected recovery, we recognize the credit portion of OTTI charges in current earnings and include the noncredit portion of OTTI in Net unrealized gains (losses) on OTTI securities on our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and net of tax in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the first nine months of 2014 and 2013 we recognized OTTI credit losses of $4 million and $16 million, respectively. The credit losses related to residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities collateralized by non-agency residential loans.  If housing and economic conditions were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and illiquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio could be adversely affected and we could incur additional OTTI credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement.

As of September 1, 2014, we have elected to apply the fair value option to certain commercial mortgage loans held for sale to agencies. This election applies to all new commercial mortgage loans held for sale originated for sale to the agencies effective on or after September 1, 2014. The election of fair value option aligns the accounting for the commercial mortgages with the related commitments to sell the loans.  We sold $2.0 billion of commercial mortgage loans to agencies during the first nine months of 2014 compared to $2.1 billion during the first nine months of 2013. Total gains of $49 million were recognized on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, during the first nine months of 2014, including $20 million in the third quarter. Comparable amounts for 2013 were $57 million and $14 million, respectively.  Residential mortgage loan origination volume was $7.1 billion during the first nine months of 2014 compared to $12.6 billion for the first nine months of 2013. The majority of such loans were originated under agency or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) standards. We sold $6.4 billion of loans and recognized related gains of $323 million during the first nine months of 2014, of which $98 million occurred in the third quarter. The comparable amounts for the first nine months of 2013 were $12.1 billion and $470 million, respectively, including $108 million in the third quarter.  Interest income on loans held for sale was $73 million in the first nine months of 2014, including $26 million in the third quarter. Comparable amounts for 2013 were $126 million and $41 million, respectively. These amounts are included in Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.  Additional information regarding our loan sale and servicing activities is included in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities and Note 8 Fair Value in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $11.1 billion at September 30, 2014 and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2013. The decrease of $.2 billion was primarily due to fair value changes of residential mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by new additions and purchases of mortgage servicing rights.

The increase in deposits during the first nine months of 2014 was primarily driven by increases in money market and savings deposits, partially offset by lower retail certificates of   deposit. Interest-bearing deposits represented 68% of total deposits at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Total borrowed funds increased $6.2 billion since December 31, 2013 as higher Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and issuances of bank notes and senior debt and subordinated debt were partially offset by a decline in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements.

We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.  Total shareholders’ equity increased $2.1 billion compared with December 31, 2013, primarily reflecting an increase in retained earnings of $2.2 billion (driven by net income of $3.2 billion and the impact of $933 million of common and preferred dividends declared) and an increase of $291 million in accumulated other comprehensive income partially offset by share repurchases of $633 million under PNC’s existing common stock repurchase authorization. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income was primarily due to the impact of market interest rates and credit spreads on securities available for sale and derivatives that are part of cash flow hedging strategies, along with the impact of pension and other postretirement benefit plan adjustments. Common shares outstanding were 528 million at September 30, 2014 and 533 million at December 31, 2013.  Our current common stock repurchase program authorization permits us to purchase up to 25 million shares of PNC common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results of the supervisory   assessment of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve and our primary bank regulators as part of the CCAR process. The Federal Reserve accepted our 2014 capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions. The capital plan included share repurchase programs of up to $1.5 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the second quarter of 2014 under PNC’s existing common stock repurchase authorization. These programs include repurchases of up to $200 million to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions. Under the capital plan authorization, PNC repurchased 2.6 million common shares for $223 million in the second quarter of 2014 and 4.2 million common shares for $360 million in the third quarter of 2014. Under the “de minimis” safe harbor of the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, PNC may make limited repurchases of common stock or other capital distributions in amounts that exceed the amounts included in its most recently approved capital plan, provided that, among other things, such distributions do not exceed, in the aggregate, 1% of PNC’s Tier 1 capital and the Federal Reserve does not object to the additional repurchases or distributions. Under this “de minimis” safe harbor, PNC repurchased $50 million of common shares to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions in the first quarter of 2014. See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business of our 2013 Form 10-K for further information concerning the CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans and the Capital and Liquidity Actions portion of the Executive Summary section of our Financial Review for the impact of the Federal Reserve’s current supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy program.     20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents Table 18: Basel III Capital                    September 30, 2014    Dollars in millions    Transitional Basel III (a) (c)      Pro forma FullyPhased-In Basel III (b) (c)     Common equity Tier 1 capital              Common stock plus related surplus, net of treasury stock   $ 14,344     $ 14,344     Retained earnings     25,464       25,464     Accumulated other comprehensive income for securities currently and previously held as available for sale     136       681     Accumulated other comprehensive income for pension and other postretirement plans     (36 )      (180 )    Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities     (8,834 )      (8,834 )    Other disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities     (80 )      (400 )    Other adjustments/(deductions)     (28 )      (93 )    Total common equity Tier 1 capital before threshold deductions     30,966       30,982     Total threshold deductions     (214 )      (1,067 )    Common equity Tier 1 capital     30,752       29,915     Additional Tier 1 capital              Preferred stock     3,945       3,945     Trust preferred capital securities     99           Noncontrolling interests (d)     790       43     Other adjustments/(deductions)     (82 )      (96 )    Tier 1 capital     35,504       33,807     Additional Tier 2 capital              Qualifying subordinated debt     5,674       4,872     Trust preferred capital securities     99           Allowance for loan and lease losses included in Tier 2 capital     3,443       226     Other     2       10     Total Basel III capital   $ 44,722     $ 38,915     Risk-Weighted Assets (e)              Basel I risk-weighted assets calculated in accordance with transition rules for 2014 (f)   $ 277,348       N/A     Estimated Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets (g)     N/A     $ 295,665     Estimated Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets (h)     N/A       289,405     Average quarterly adjusted total assets     319,696       318,471     Basel III capital ratios              Common equity Tier 1     11.1 %      10.1 % (i) (k)    Tier 1 risk-based     12.8       11.4  (i) (l)    Total capital risk-based     16.1       13.5  (j) (m)    Leverage (n)     11.1       10.6       (a) Calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during 2014.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 21    Table of Contents  The Basel II framework, which was adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2004, seeks to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. The U.S. banking agencies initially adopted rules to implement the Basel II capital framework in 2004. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted final rules (referred to as the advanced approaches) that modified the Basel II framework effective January 1, 2014. See the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2013 Form 10-K. Prior to fully implementing the advanced approaches established by these rules to calculate risk-weighted assets, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. must successfully complete a “parallel run” qualification phase. Both PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. entered this parallel run phase on January 1, 2013. This phase must last at least four consecutive quarters, although, consistent with the experience of other U.S. banks, we currently anticipate a multi-year parallel run period. After PNC exits parallel run, its regulatory risk-based capital ratio for each measure (e.g., Common equity Tier 1 ratio) will be the lower of the ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.  As a result of the staggered effective dates of the final U.S. capital rules issued in July 2013, as well as the fact that PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2014 are based on the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under Basel III (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2014) and Basel I risk-weighted assets (subject to certain adjustments as defined by the Basel III rules). We refer to the capital ratios calculated using these Basel III phased-in provisions and adjusted Basel I risk-weighted assets as the Transitional Basel III ratios.  Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our September 30, 2014 capital levels were aligned with them.  At September 30, 2014, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A., our domestic bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized,” PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. must have, during 2014, Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based and 10% for Total capital risk-based, and PNC Bank, N.A. must have a Transitional Basel III leverage ratio of at least 5%.  Common equity Tier 1 capital as defined under the Basel III rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies differs materially from Basel I. For example, under Basel III, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institution’s adjusted Common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel I regulatory capital excludes accumulated other comprehensive income related to securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans, whereas under Basel III these items are a component of PNC’s capital. The Basel III final rules also eliminate the Tier 1 treatment of trust preferred securities for bank holding companies with $15 billion or more in assets. In the third quarter of 2013, we concluded our redemptions of the discounted trust preferred securities previously assumed through acquisitions.  The access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives, the ability to undertake new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution’s capital strength.  We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on PNC in the Banking Regulation and Supervision section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K.  PNC’s Basel I ratios as of December 31, 2013, which were PNC’s effective regulatory capital ratios as of that date, were 10.5% for Tier 1 common capital ratio, 12.4% for Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, 15.8% for Total risk-based capital ratio and 11.1% for leverage ratio. Our 2013 Form 10-K included additional information regarding our Basel I capital ratios.     22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  We engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as “off-balance sheet arrangements.” Additional information on these types of activities is included in our 2013 Form 10-K and in the following sections of this Report:      •    Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of this Financial Review,      •    Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements,      •    Note 10 Capital Securities of a Subsidiary Trust and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, and      •    Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements.  PNC consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE.  A summary of VIEs, including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements, as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is included in Note 2 of this Report.  Trust Preferred Securities  We are subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on dividend payments, in connection with $206 million in principal amount of an outstanding junior subordinated debenture associated with $200 million of trust preferred securities that were issued by PNC Capital Trust C, a subsidiary statutory trust (both amounts as of September 30, 2014). Generally, if there is (i) an event of default under the debenture, (ii) PNC elects to defer interest on the debenture, (iii) PNC exercises its right to defer payments on the related trust preferred security issued by the statutory trust or (iv) there is a default under PNC’s guarantee of such payment obligations, as specified in the applicable governing documents, then PNC would be subject during the period of such default or deferral to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the debenture holders similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreement with PNC Preferred Funding Trust II. See Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K for information on contractual limitations on dividend payments resulting from securities issued by PNC Preferred Funding Trust I and PNC Preferred Funding Trust II.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 23    Table of Contents FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  In addition to the following, see Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further information regarding fair value.  The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured at fair value at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and the portions of such assets and liabilities that are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Table 19: Fair Value Measurements – Summary                            September 30, 2014     December 31, 2013    Dollars in millions   Total FairValue     Level 3     Total FairValue     Level 3     Total assets   $ 57,978     $ 10,848     $ 63,221     $ 10,650     Total assets at fair value as a percentage of consolidated assets     17 %           20 %          Level 3 assets as a percentage of total assets at fair value          19 %           17 %    Level 3 assets as a percentage of consolidated assets             3 %              3 %    Total liabilities   $ 5,187     $ 679     $ 5,585     $ 638     Total liabilities at fair value as a percentage of consolidated liabilities     2 %           2 %          Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities at fair value          13 %           11 %    Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of consolidated liabilities             <1 %              <1 %   The majority of assets recorded at fair value are included in the securities available for sale portfolio. The majority of Level 3 assets represent non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the securities available for sale portfolio for which there was limited market activity, equity investments and mortgage servicing rights.  An instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. PNC’s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of the reporting period. For additional information regarding the transfers of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels, see Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW  We have six reportable business segments:      •    Retail Banking      •    Corporate & Institutional Banking      •    Asset Management Group      •    Residential Mortgage Banking      •    BlackRock      •    Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio  Business segment results, including inter-segment revenues, and a description of each business are included in Note 18 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Certain amounts included in this Financial Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 18 primarily due to the presentation in this Financial Review of business net interest revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Note 18 presents results of businesses for the first nine months and third quarter of 2014 and 2013.    24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  Retail Banking   (Unaudited)  Table 20: Retail Banking Table                 Nine months ended September 30 Dollars in millions, except as noted   2014     2013     Income Statement              Net interest income   $ 2,938     $ 3,067     Noninterest income              Service charges on deposits     461       419     Brokerage     176       167     Consumer services     714       679     Other     240       268     Total noninterest income     1,591       1,533     Total revenue     4,529       4,600     Provision for credit losses     223       462     Noninterest expense     3,430       3,438     Pretax earnings     876       700     Income taxes     320       257     Earnings   $ 556     $ 443     Average Balance Sheet              Loans              Consumer              Home equity   $ 28,985     $ 29,203     Indirect auto     9,093       7,434     Indirect other     726       938     Education     7,314       8,005     Credit cards     4,327       4,106     Other     2,200       2,145     Total consumer     52,645       51,831     Commercial and commercial real estate     10,924       11,311     Floor plan     2,227       1,997     Residential mortgage     618       764     Total loans     66,414       65,903     Goodwill and other intangible assets     6,043       6,127     Other assets     2,807       2,590     Total assets   $ 75,264     $ 74,620     Deposits              Noninterest-bearing demand   $ 21,890     $ 21,096     Interest-bearing demand     33,889       31,647     Money market     49,945       48,628     Total transaction deposits     105,724       101,371     Savings     11,713       10,812     Certificates of deposit     19,314       21,846     Total deposits     136,751       134,029     Other liabilities     440       327     Total liabilities   $ 137,191     $ 134,356     Performance Ratios              Return on average assets     .99 %      .79 %    Noninterest income to total revenue     35       33     Efficiency     76       75     Other Information (a)              Credit-related statistics:              Commercial nonperforming assets   $ 146     $ 212     Consumer nonperforming assets     1,037       1,074     Total nonperforming assets (b)   $ 1,183     $ 1,286     Purchased impaired loans (c)   $ 600     $ 718     Commercial lending net charge-offs   $ 33     $ 76     Credit card lending net charge-offs     109       119     Consumer lending (excluding credit card) net charge-offs     212       350     Total net charge-offs   $ 354     $ 545     Commercial lending annualized net charge-off ratio     .34 %      .76 %    Credit card lending annualized net charge-off ratio     3.37 %      3.87 %    Consumer lending (excluding credit card) annualized net charge-off ratio (d)     .58 %      .97 %    Total annualized net charge-off ratio (d)     .71 %      1.11 %                At September 30   2014     2013     Other Information (Continued) (a)              Home equity portfolio credit statistics: (e)              % of first lien positions at origination (f)     53 %      52 %    Weighted-average loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) (f) (g)     78 %      83 %    Weighted-average updated FICO scores (h)     747       745     Annualized net charge-off ratio (d)     .55 %      1.17 %    Delinquency data – % of total loans: (i)              Loans 30 – 59 days past due     .19 %      .22 %    Loans 60 – 89 days past due     .07 %      .09 %    Accruing loans past due     .26 %      .32 %    Nonperforming loans     3.04 %      3.13 %    Other statistics:              ATMs     8,178       7,441     Branches (j)     2,691       2,724     Brokerage account client assets (in billions)   $ 43     $ 40     Customer-related statistics (average):              Non-teller deposit transactions (k)     34 %      23 %    Digital consumer customers (l)     45 %      37 %     (a) Presented as of September 30, except for net charge-offs, net charge-off ratios and customer-related statistics, which are for the nine months ended.

(k) Percentage of total consumer and business banking deposit transactions processed at an ATM or through our mobile banking application.    (l) Represents consumer checking relationships that process the majority of their transactions through non-teller channels.  Retail Banking earned $556 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with earnings of $443 million for the same period a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by a lower provision for credit losses, increased noninterest income due to strong fee income growth, and lower noninterest expense resulting from disciplined expense management and the impact of branch consolidations in 2013. These increases in earnings were partially offset by lower net interest income driven by interest rate spread compression on the value of deposits, lower yields on loans, and lower purchase accounting accretion.  Retail Banking continues to augment and refine its core checking account products to enhance the customer experience and grow value. In the first nine months of 2014, we completed the conversion of consumer and business banking customers from free checking and we focused on product value for consumers and small businesses and growing customer share of wallet through the sale of liquidity, banking and investment products.      •    Completed the market rollout of PNC Total Insight SM, an integrated online banking and investing experience for our customers.      •    Enhanced business banking Cash Flow Insight SM features and customer experience.      •    Introduced relationship pricing for business banking customers.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 25    Table of Contents  Retail Banking also continued to focus on serving more customers through cost effective channels that meet their evolving preferences for convenience.      •    In the first nine months of 2014, approximately 45% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions compared with 37% for the same period in 2013.      •    Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 34% of total deposit transactions in the first nine months of 2014 compared with 23% for the same period a year ago.      •    As part of PNC’s retail branch transformation strategy we continue to evolve our network. We converted 45 branches to universal branches as of September 30, 2014 in a pilot program; additional branches will be converted in the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015. In the first nine months of 2014, 43 branches were closed or consolidated.      •    Retail Banking’s primary geographic footprint extends across 17 states and Washington, D.C. Our retail branch network covers nearly half the U.S. population, with 2,691 branches and 8,178 ATMs.  Total revenue for the first nine months of 2014 was $4.5 billion, $71 million lower than the same period of 2013. Net interest income of $2.9 billion decreased $129 million compared with the same period a year ago. The decrease resulted primarily from interest rate spread compression on the value of deposits due to the continued low rate environment, lower yields on loans and lower purchase accounting accretion on loans and deposits.  Noninterest income increased $58 million compared to the first nine months of 2013. Noninterest income included strong customer-related fee income growth primarily resulting from changes in product offerings and increases in customer-initiated transactions. Noninterest income included gains on sales of Visa Class B common shares of $173 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to $168 million for the same period a year ago; three million shares were sold in the first nine months of 2014 compared to four million shares in the same period a year ago.  The provision for credit losses was $223 million and net charge-offs were $354 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $462 million and $545 million, respectively, for the same period in 2013. The provision for credit losses decrease was due to credit quality improvement. The decrease in the net charge-offs was attributable to the impact of alignment with interagency guidance in the first quarter of 2013 and improved credit quality.  Noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2014 was $8 million lower than the same period in 2013. The decrease was due to disciplined expense management and the impact of branch consolidations in 2013.  Growing core checking deposits is key to Retail Banking’s growth and to providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. The deposit product strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, target specific   products and markets for growth, and focus on the retention and growth of customer balances. In the first nine months of 2014, average total deposits of $136.8 billion increased $2.7 billion, or 2%, compared with the same period in 2013.      •    Average transaction deposits grew $4.4 billion, or 4%, and average savings deposit balances grew $901 million, or 8%, year-over-year as a result of organic deposit growth. In the first nine months of 2014, compared with the same period a year ago, average demand deposits increased $3.0 billion, or 6%, to $55.8 billion and average money market deposits increased $1.3 billion, or 3%, to $50.0 billion.      •    Total average certificates of deposit decreased $2.5 billion, or 12%, compared to the same period of 2013. The decline in average certificates of deposit was due to the expected run-off of maturing accounts.  Retail Banking continued to focus on a relationship-based lending strategy that targets specific products and markets for growth, small businesses, and auto dealerships. In the first nine months of 2014, average total loans were $66.4 billion, an increase of $511 million, or 1%, over the same period of 2013.      •    Average indirect auto loans increased $1.7 billion, or 22%, compared to the first nine months of 2013. The increase was primarily due to increases in auto sales as well as the expansion of our indirect sales force and product introduction to the Southeast markets.      •    Average auto dealer floor plan loans grew $230 million, or 12%, in the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same period a year ago, primarily resulting from sales growth and additional dealer relationships.      •    Average credit card balances increased $221 million, or 5%, over the first nine months of 2013 as a result of efforts to increase credit card share of wallet through organic growth.      •    Average home equity loans decreased $218 million compared to the first nine months of 2013. The portfolio declined as decreases in lines of credit were partially offset by increases in term loans. Retail Banking’s home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with 97% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint.      •    For the first nine months of 2014, compared to the same period a year ago, average loan balances for the remainder of the portfolio declined a net $1.4 billion, driven by declines in the education portfolio of $691 million and commercial & commercial real estate of $387 million. The discontinued government guaranteed education loan, indirect other and residential mortgage portfolios are primarily run-off portfolios.  Nonperforming assets totaled $1.2 billion at September 30, 2014, a decrease of $103 million, or 8%, over the same period of 2013, driven by declines in both commercial and consumer non-performing loans.     26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  Corporate & Institutional Banking  (Unaudited)   Table 21: Corporate & Institutional Banking Table                 Nine months ended September 30 Dollars in millions, except as noted   2014     2013     Income Statement              Net interest income   $ 2,777     $ 2,844     Noninterest income              Corporate service fees     926       820     Other     329       453     Noninterest income     1,255       1,273     Total revenue     4,032       4,117     Provision for credit losses     86       4     Noninterest expense     1,520       1,474     Pretax earnings     2,426       2,639     Income taxes     884       944     Earnings   $ 1,542     $ 1,695     Average Balance Sheet              Loans              Commercial   $ 77,550     $ 71,601     Commercial real estate     20,927       17,240     Equipment lease financing     6,863       6,606     Total commercial lending     105,340       95,447     Consumer     1,116       919     Total loans     106,456       96,366     Goodwill and other intangible assets     3,812       3,792     Loans held for sale     973       1,058     Other assets     9,991       10,936     Total assets   $ 121,232     $ 112,152     Deposits              Noninterest-bearing demand   $ 43,348     $ 40,850     Money market     20,930       17,355     Other     7,646       6,962     Total deposits     71,924       65,167     Other liabilities     7,454       16,572     Total liabilities   $ 79,378     $ 81,739     Performance Ratios              Return on average assets     1.70 %      2.02 %    Noninterest income to total revenue     31       31     Efficiency     38       36     Commercial Mortgage Servicing Portfolio – Serviced For PNC and Others (in billions)              Beginning of period   $ 308     $ 282     Acquisitions/additions     62       57     Repayments/transfers     (48 )      (41 )    End of period   $ 322     $ 298     Other Information              Consolidated revenue from: (a)              Treasury Management (b)   $ 950     $ 951     Capital Markets (c)   $ 547     $ 502     Commercial mortgage loans held for sale (d)   $ 84     $ 96     Commercial mortgage loan servicing income (e)     164       166     Commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge (f)     33       73     Total commercial mortgage banking activities   $ 281     $ 335     Average Loans (by C&IB business)              Corporate Banking   $ 53,530     $ 50,260     Real Estate     27,260       21,597     Business Credit     13,074       11,508     Equipment Finance     10,362       9,961     Other     2,230       3,040     Total average loans   $ 106,456     $ 96,366     Total loans (g)   $ 109,792     $ 99,337     Net carrying amount of commercial mortgage servicing rights (g)   $ 532     $ 541     Credit-related statistics:              Nonperforming assets (g) (h)   $ 616     $ 949     Purchased impaired loans (g) (i)   $ 316     $ 600     Net charge-offs   $ 10     $ 95       (a) Represents consolidated PNC amounts.

Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2014, a decrease of $153 million compared with the first nine months of 2013. The decrease in earnings was due to narrower spreads on loans and deposits, lower purchase accounting accretion, an increase in the provision for credit losses, and decreases in asset valuations, partially offset by the impact of higher average loans and deposits. We continue to focus on building client relationships in our legacy and new Southeast markets where the risk-return profile is attractive.  Net interest income was $2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2014, a decrease of $67 million from the first nine months of 2013 primarily due to continued spread compression on loans and deposits, lower purchase accounting and the impact from the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility usage fees from net interest income to Corporate Service fees, partially offset by the impact of higher average loans and deposits.  Corporate service fees were $926 million in the first nine months of 2014, increasing $106 million compared to the first nine months of 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and the impact of the second quarter 2014 correction to reclassify certain commercial facility fees from net interest income to corporate service fees, partially offset by a lower commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge.  Other noninterest income was $329 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $453 million in the first nine months of 2013. The decrease of $124 million was driven by lower revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities, lower gains on asset sales and lower multifamily loans originated for sale to agencies.  The provision for credit losses was $86 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared with $4 million in the first nine months of 2013 reflecting our continual qualitative assessments of the portfolio given the growth trends over the     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 27    Table of Contents   recent quarters. Net charge-offs were $10 million in the first nine months of 2014, which represents a decrease of $85 million compared with the first nine months of 2013 primarily attributable to a decrease in commercial and commercial real estate charge-offs.  Nonperforming assets were $616 million, a 35% decrease from September 30, 2013 resulting from continued improving credit quality.  Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion in the first nine months of 2014, an increase of $46 million primarily driven by higher incentive compensation costs associated with business activity.  Average loans were $106.5 billion in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $96.4 billion in the first nine months of 2013, an increase of 10% reflecting strong growth in Real Estate, Corporate Banking, and Business Credit:      •    Corporate Banking business provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business increased $3.3 billion, or 7%, in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the first nine months of 2013, primarily due to an increase in loan commitments from specialty lending businesses.      •    PNC Real Estate provides commercial real estate and real estate-related lending through both conventional and affordable multifamily financing. Average loans for this business increased $5.7 billion, or 26%, in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the first nine months of 2013 due to increased originations.      •    PNC Business Credit provides asset-based lending. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets. Average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 14%, in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the first nine months of 2013 due to increasing deal sizes and higher utilization.      •    PNC Equipment Finance provides equipment financing solutions with over $11.5 billion in equipment finance assets as of September 30, 2014. Average equipment finance assets in the first nine months of 2014 were $11.1 billion, an increase of $.5 billion or 5% compared with the first nine months of 2013.  Loan commitments increased 4%, or $8.1 billion, to $204.2 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to $196.1 billion at December 31, 2013, and 8%, or $14.4 billion, compared to $189.8 billion at September 30, 2013, primarily due to growth in our Real Estate, Corporate Banking and Business Credit businesses.  Period-end loan balances increased by 8%, or $8.0 billion, to $109.8 billion at September 30, 2014 compared with $101.8 billion at December 31, 2013 and 11%, or $10.5 billion, compared with $99.3 billion at September 30, 2013.  Average deposits were $71.9 billion in the first nine months of 2014, an increase of $6.8 billion, or 10%, compared with the first nine months of 2013 as a result of business growth and inflows into money market and noninterest-bearing deposits.  The commercial mortgage servicing portfolio was $322 billion at September 30, 2014, an increase of 5% compared with December 31, 2013 and an increase of 8% compared to September 30, 2013 as servicing additions exceeded portfolio run-off.  Product Revenue  In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all our business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 21 in the Corporate & Institutional Banking portion of this Business Segments Review section includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows. Treasury management revenue, comprised of fees and net interest income from customer deposit balances, totaled $950 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared with $951 million for the first nine months of 2013. Lower spreads on deposits in the first nine months of 2014 compared with the first nine months of 2013 were offset by an increase in average deposit balances.  Capital markets revenue includes merger and acquisition advisory fees, loan syndications, derivatives, foreign exchange, asset-backed finance revenue and fixed income activities. Revenue from capital markets-related products and services totaled $547 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $502 million in the first nine months of 2013. The increase in the comparison was driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and to a lesser extent higher loan syndications and foreign exchange revenue, which was partially offset by lower revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities and related derivatives sales.  Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total commercial mortgage banking activities resulted in revenue of $281 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $335 million in the first nine months of 2013. The decrease in the comparison was mainly due to lower net commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations.     28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  Asset Management Group  (Unaudited)  Table 22: Asset Management Group Table                 Nine months ended September 30 Dollars in millions, except as noted   2014     2013     Income Statement              Net interest income   $ 215     $ 217     Noninterest income     611       554     Total revenue     826       771     Provision for credit losses     2       2     Noninterest expense     610       570     Pretax earnings     214       199     Income taxes     78       73     Earnings   $ 136     $ 126     Average Balance Sheet              Loans              Consumer   $ 5,407     $ 4,950     Commercial and commercial real estate     997       1,043     Residential mortgage     794       776     Total loans     7,198       6,769     Goodwill and other intangible assets     264       297     Other assets     225       223     Total assets   $ 7,687     $ 7,289     Deposits              Noninterest-bearing demand   $ 1,342     $ 1,266     Interest-bearing demand     3,887       3,472     Money market     3,918       3,752     Total transaction deposits     9,147       8,490     CDs/IRAs/savings deposits     448       442     Total deposits     9,595       8,932     Other liabilities     51       60     Total liabilities   $ 9,646     $ 8,992     Performance Ratios              Return on average assets     2.37 %      2.31 %    Noninterest income to total revenue     74       72     Efficiency     74       74     Other Information              Total nonperforming assets (a) (b)   $ 73     $ 68     Purchased impaired loans (a) (c)   $ 89     $ 100     Total net charge-offs   $ 3     $ (2 )    Client Assets Under Administration (in billions) (a) (d)              Personal   $ 113     $ 106     Institutional     146       131     Total   $ 259     $ 237                 Nine months ended September 30 Dollars in millions, except as noted   2014     2013     Asset Type              Equity   $ 147     $ 132     Fixed Income     72       70     Liquidity/Other     40       35     Total   $ 259     $ 237     Discretionary client assets under management              Personal   $ 85     $ 80     Institutional     47       42     Total   $ 132     $ 122     Asset Type              Equity   $ 72     $ 65     Fixed Income     40       40     Liquidity/Other     20       17     Total   $ 132     $ 122     Nondiscretionary client assets under administration              Personal   $ 28     $ 26     Institutional     99       89     Total   $ 127     $ 115     Asset Type              Equity   $ 75     $ 67     Fixed Income     32       30     Liquidity/Other     20       18     Total   $ 127     $ 115      (a) As of September 30.

Client assets under administration were $259 billion as of September 30, 2014 compared to $237 billion as of September 30, 2013. Earnings increased due to higher noninterest income from higher client assets, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.  The core growth strategies of the business include increasing sales sourced from other PNC lines of business, maximizing front line productivity and optimizing market presence including additions to staff in high opportunity markets. Wealth Management and Hawthorn have over 100 offices operating in 7 out of the 10 most affluent states in the U.S. with a majority co-located with retail banking branches. The businesses’ strategies primarily focus on growing client assets under management through expanding relationships directly and through other PNC lines of business and increasing the share of our clients’ investable assets.  Institutional Asset Management provides advisory, custody, and retirement administration services to institutional clients primarily within our banking footprint. The business segment     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29    Table of Contents   also offers PNC proprietary mutual funds. Institutional Asset Management is strengthening its partnership with the Corporate Bank to drive growth and is focused on building retirement capabilities and expanding product solutions for all customers.  Client assets under administration were $259 billion at September 30, 2014, an increase of $22 billion compared to a year ago. Discretionary client assets under management were $132 billion at September 30, 2014 compared with $122 billion at September 30, 2013. The increase was driven by higher equity markets, new sales, and positive net flows of $3.1 billion, after adjustments for cyclical client activities.  Total revenue for the first nine months of 2014 was $826 million compared with $771 million for the same period in 2013, due to stronger average equity markets in the respective periods and positive net flows.  Noninterest expense was $610 million in the first nine months of 2014, an increase of $40 million, or 7%, from the prior year period. The increase was attributable to compensation expense. Over the last 12 months, total full-time headcount has increased by approximately 56 positions, or 2%. Asset Management Group remains focused on disciplined expense management as it invests in strategic growth opportunities.  Average deposits for the first nine months of 2014 increased $663 million, or 7%, over the prior year period. Average transaction deposits grew 8% to $9.1 billion compared with the first nine months of 2013 and were partially offset by the run-off of maturing certificates of deposit. Average loan balances of $7.2 billion increased $.4 billion, or 6%, from the prior year period due to continued growth in the consumer loan portfolio.

Residential Mortgage Banking made $44 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with earnings of $93 million in the first nine months of 2013. Earnings declined from the prior year nine month period primarily as a result of decreased loan sales revenue and lower net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by reduced provision for mortgage repurchase obligations, increased servicing fees and lower noninterest expense.     30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  The strategic focus of the business is the acquisition of new customers through a retail loan officer sales force with an emphasis on home purchase transactions. Our strategy involves competing on the basis of superior service to new and existing customers in serving their home purchase and refinancing needs. A key consideration in pursuing this approach is the cross-sell opportunity, especially in the bank footprint markets.  Residential Mortgage Banking overview:      •    Total loan originations were $7.1 billion for the first nine months of 2014 compared with $12.6 billion in the comparable period of 2013. Loans continue to be originated primarily through direct channels under Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA)/Department of Veterans Affairs agency guidelines. Refinancings were 53% of originations for the first nine months of 2014 and 72% in the first nine months of 2013. During the first nine months of 2014, 22% of loan originations were under the original or revised Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP or HARP 2).      •    Investors having purchased mortgage loans may request PNC to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans that they believe do not comply with applicable contractual loan origination covenants and representations and warranties we have made. At September 30, 2014, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the Residential Mortgage Banking business segment was $108 million compared with $471 million at September 30, 2013. See the Recourse And Repurchase Obligations section of this Financial Review and Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional information.      •    Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $111 billion at September 30, 2014 and $115 billion at September 30, 2013 as payoffs continued to outpace new direct loan origination volume and acquisitions.      •    Noninterest income was $503 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $628 million in the first nine months of 2013. Decreased loan sales revenue and net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights were partially offset by increased servicing fees. In addition, a residential mortgage repurchase obligation benefit of $4 million was recorded in the first nine months of 2014 compared with a provision expense of $71 million in the first nine months of 2013.      •    Provision for credit losses during the first nine months of 2014 was a $1 million benefit, compared with an expense of $24 million in the first nine months of 2013.      •    Net interest income was $115 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $145 million in the first nine months of 2013. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to the decline in origination volume.      •    Noninterest expense was $550 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $602 million in the first nine months of 2013. Lower origination and servicing costs, as well as lower residential mortgage foreclosure-related costs drove the decline in expenses, partially offset by increased legal accruals.      •    The fair value of mortgage servicing rights was $1.0 billion at September 30, 2014 and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2013.

(c) Includes nonperforming loans of $.6 billion at September 30, 2014 and $.7 billion at September 30, 2013.    (d) Recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to acquisitions. At September 30, 2014, this segment contained 80% of PNC’s purchased impaired loans.  This business segment consists of non-strategic assets primarily obtained through acquisitions of other companies. The business activity of this segment is to manage the wind-down of the portfolios while maximizing the value and mitigating risk.  Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio had earnings of $291 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $260 million in the first nine months of 2013. Earnings increased year-over-year due to a benefit from the provision for credit losses compared to provision expense in the prior year period and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net interest income.  Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio overview:      •    Net interest income was $425 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $528 million in the first nine months of 2013. The decrease was driven by lower purchase accounting accretion and interest earned on a declining average loan portfolio.      •    Noninterest income was $22 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $47 million in the first nine months of 2013. The decrease was driven by higher estimated losses on home equity loans and lines repurchase obligations.      •    The first nine months of 2014 reflected a benefit from the provision for credit losses of $99 million compared to an expense of $38 million in the first nine months of 2013. The decline in provision reflected overall improvement in credit quality. A contributing economic factor was the increasing value of residential real estate that improved expected cash flows on purchased impaired loans.      •    Noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2014 was $86 million compared with $126 million in the first nine months of 2013. A smaller portfolio and improving market conditions drove lower commercial OREO expense and lower cost on nonaccrual residential mortgages.      •    Average portfolio loans declined to $9.3 billion in the first nine months of 2014 compared with $10.9 billion in the first nine months of 2013. The overall decline was driven by customer payment activity and portfolio management activities to reduce underperforming assets.      •    Net charge-offs were $35 million in the first nine months of 2014 and $163 million in the first nine months of 2013.      •    At September 30, 2014, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio was $24 million compared to $23 million at September 30, 2013. See Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information.     32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  Note 1 Accounting Policies in Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K and in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report describe the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.  We must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value.  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent third-party sources, including appraisers and valuation specialists, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.  We discuss the following critical accounting policies and judgments under this same heading in Item 7 of our 2013 Form 10-K:      •    Fair Value Measurements      •    Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit      •    Estimated Cash Flows on Purchased Impaired Loans      •    Goodwill      •    Lease Residuals      •    Revenue Recognition      •    Residential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights      •    Income Taxes      •    Recently Issued Accounting Standards      •    Recent Accounting Pronouncements  We provide additional information about many of these items in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item l of this Report.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-04, Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure. This ASU clarifies that an in substance repossession or   foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon a) the creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or b) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. This guidance is effective as of January 1, 2015. We do not expect this ASU to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.  In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. This ASU limits discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. Additionally, the ASU requires expanded disclosures for discontinued operations and individually significant components of an entity that do not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2014 and is to be applied prospectively. We do not expect this ASU to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). This ASU clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP with one model. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the satisfaction of a performance obligation by transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. The requirements within the ASU should be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (with several practical expedients for certain completed contracts) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our results of operations and financial position.  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures. This ASU changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and linked repurchase financings to secured borrowing accounting, which is consistent with the accounting for other repurchase agreements. The ASU also requires separate accounting for a     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33    Table of Contents   transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty (i.e., a repurchase financing), which will result in secured borrowing treatment for the repurchase agreement. The accounting changes within the ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2014. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. This ASU clarifies that all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that the performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period would apply existing guidance that relates to share-based payments with performance conditions that affect vesting. Specifically, compensation cost would be recognized if it is probable that the performance condition would be achieved. This ASU is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-13, Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU allows a reporting entity that consolidates a collateralized financing entity and accounts for the consolidated financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value to measure those assets and liabilities using the more observable of a) the fair value of its financial assets, or b) the fair value of its financial liabilities. If the reporting entity chooses not to apply this measurement alternative to a consolidated entity that is within the scope of this guidance, any difference between the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities of that consolidated collateralized financing entity should be reflected currently in earnings and attributed to the reporting entity in the consolidated income statement. This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The reporting entity may apply this ASU under a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the annual period of adoption or through a retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-14, Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). This ASU requires that a mortgage loan be derecognized and that a separate other receivable be recognized upon foreclosure when a) the loan has a government guarantee that is not separable from the loan before foreclosure; b) the creditor has the intent to convey the real estate to the guarantor and make a claim on the guarantee and the creditor has the ability to recover under that claim at the time of foreclosure; and c) any amount of the claim that is determined upon the basis of the real estate is fixed at the time of foreclosure. The receivable should be measured based on the loan balance (inclusive of principal and interest) that is expected to be recovered from the guarantor. This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2014. The ASU may be adopted using either a prospective or modified retrospective transition method consistent with the method elected to adopt ASU 2014-04, Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements – Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. For each annual and interim reporting period, this ASU requires an entity’s management to evaluate whether there are known and reasonably known conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, at the date that the financial statements are issued that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, the entity must provide additional disclosures under this ASU, including a statement in the footnotes indicating there is substantial doubt if it is not alleviated after consideration of management’s plans to mitigate those events or conditions. The ASU is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this Report regarding the impact of new accounting standards which we have adopted in 2014.     34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  STATUS OF QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN  We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are applied as a percentage of eligible compensation. We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan.  We currently estimate pretax pension income of $7 million in 2014 compared with pretax expense of $74 million in 2013. This year-over-year expected decrease reflects the impact of favorable returns on plan assets experienced in 2013, as well as the effects of the higher discount rate required to be used in 2014.  The table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions, using 2014 estimated expense as a baseline.  Table 26: Pension Expense – Sensitivity Analysis            Change in Assumption (a)   EstimatedIncrease/(Decrease)to 2014 PensionExpense(In millions)     .5% decrease in discount rate   $ (2 )    .5% decrease in expected long-term return on assets   $ 21     .5% increase in compensation rate   $ 1      (a) The impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.  We provide additional information on our pension plan in Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K.  RECOURSE AND REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, PNC has sold commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loans/ lines of credit directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets.  Commercial Mortgage Loan Recourse Obligations  We originate and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to FNMA under FNMA’s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program. We   participated in a similar program with the FHLMC. Our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment. For more information regarding our Commercial Mortgage Loan Recourse Obligations, see the Recourse and Repurchase Obligations section of Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Residential Mortgage Repurchase Obligations  While residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis, we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors. These loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where PNC is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements. Residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through Agency securitizations, Non-Agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions. As discussed in Note 2 in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, Agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with FNMA, FHLMC and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), while Non-Agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with private investors. Mortgage loan sale transactions that are not part of a securitization may involve FNMA, FHLMC or private investors. Our historical exposure and activity associated with Agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with FNMA and FHLMC, as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with FHA and VA-insured and uninsured loans pooled in GNMA securitizations historically have been minimal. In addition to indemnification and repurchase risk, we face other risks of loss with respect to our participation in these programs, some of which are described in Note 23 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in our 2013 Form 10-K with respect to governmental inquiries related to FHA-insured loans. Repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment.  Origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity and, accordingly, management continually assesses the need to recognize indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements. We establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold first and second-lien mortgages for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased. For the first and second-lien mortgage sold portfolio, we have established an indemnification and repurchase liability pursuant to investor     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 35    Table of Contents   sale agreements based on claims made and our estimate of future claims on a loan by loan basis. To estimate the mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, we consider the following factors: (i) borrower performance in our historically sold portfolio (both actual and estimated future defaults); (ii) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims; (iii) estimated probable future repurchase claims, considering information about file requests, delinquent and liquidated loans, resolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and our historical experience with claim rescissions; (iv) the potential ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase claims (“rescission rate”) and (v) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral, make-whole settlement or indemnification.  For more information see the Recourse and Repurchase Obligations section included in Item 7 of our 2013 Form 10-K and Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  The following tables present the unpaid principal balance of repurchase claims by vintage and total unresolved repurchase claims for the quarter ended and as of September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to the quarter ended and as of December 31, 2013. These comparisons reflect the impact of settlement agreements reached late in the fourth quarter of 2013.

These losses are charged to the indemnification and repurchase liability.    (c) Represents fair value of loans repurchased only as we have no exposure to changes in the fair value of loans or underlying collateral when indemnification/settlement payments are made to investors.    (d) Repurchase activity associated with insured loans, government-guaranteed loans and loans repurchased through the exercise of our removal of account provision (ROAP) option are excluded from this table. Refer to Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further discussion of ROAPs.    (e) Activity relates to loans sold through Non-Agency securitizations and loan sale transactions.    Residential mortgages that we service through FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA securitizations, and for which we could experience a loss if required to repurchase a delinquent loan due to a breach in representations or warranties, were $49 billion at September 30, 2014, of which $252 million was 90 days or more delinquent. These amounts were $48 billion and $253 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, PNC reached agreements with both FNMA and FHLMC to resolve their repurchase claims with respect to loans sold between 2000 and 2008. PNC paid a total of $191 million related to these settlements. The volume of new repurchase demand claims dropped significantly in the first nine months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 as a result of the settlement agreements in the fourth quarter of 2013. Additionally, the liability for estimated losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for residential mortgages decreased to $108 million at September 30, 2014 from $131 million at December 31, 2013.  We believe our indemnification and repurchase liability appropriately reflects the estimated probable losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for all residential mortgage loans sold and outstanding as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. In making these estimates, we consider the losses that we expect to incur over the life of the sold loans. See Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information.  Home Equity Repurchase Obligations  PNC’s repurchase obligations include obligations with respect to certain brokered home equity loans/lines of credit that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by National City prior to our acquisition of National City. PNC is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the loans sold in these transactions. Repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity loans/ lines of credit is reported in the Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio segment.  For more information regarding our Home Equity Repurchase Obligations, see the Recourse and Repurchase Obligations section under Item 7 of our 2013 Form 10-K and Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 37    Table of Contents  RISK MANAGEMENT  PNC encounters risk as part of the normal course of operating our business. Accordingly, we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.  The Risk Management section included in Item 7 of our 2013 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk management framework including risk appetite and strategy, risk culture, risk organization and governance, risk identification and quantification, risk control and limits, and risk monitoring and reporting. Additionally, our 2013 Form 10-K provides an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, operational, model, liquidity and market. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section.  The following information updates our 2013 Form 10-K risk management disclosures.  Credit Risk Management  Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Our processes for managing credit risk are embedded in PNC’s risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are: identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against our risk tolerance and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the Board through our governance structure.  Asset Quality Overview  Asset quality for the first nine months of 2014 improved from both December 31, 2013 and September 30, 2013.      •    Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2014 decreased $482 million compared with December 31, 2013 as a result of improvements in both consumer and commercial nonperforming loans. Consumer lending nonperforming loans decreased $214 million, commercial nonperforming loans declined $137 million and commercial real estate nonperforming loans decreased $123 million. Nonperforming assets were 0.89% of total assets at September 30, 2014 compared with 1.08% at December 31, 2013.      •    Overall loan delinquencies of $2.0 billion decreased $.5 billion, or 19%, from year-end 2013 levels. The reduction was due in large part to a reduction in accruing government insured residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more of $240 million, the          majority of which we took possession of and conveyed the real estate, or are in the process of conveyance and claim resolution.      •    Net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2014 were $82 million, down 63% from third quarter 2013 net charge-offs of $224 million primarily due to improving credit quality. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, net charge-offs were $413 million, down from $888 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2013, which included $134 million of charge-offs due to the impact of alignment with interagency supervisory guidance on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending in the first quarter of 2013.      •    Provision for credit losses decreased to $55 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $137 million for the third quarter of 2013. Provision for credit losses for the nine months ending September 30, 2014 declined to $221 million compared with $530 million for the nine months ending September 30, 2013. The decreases in provision reflected improved overall credit quality, including lower consumer loan delinquencies. A contributing economic factor in the nine month comparison was the increasing value of residential real estate, which improved expected cash flows from our purchased impaired loans.      •    The level of ALLL decreased to $3.4 billion at September 30, 2014 from $3.6 billion at December 31, 2013.  Nonperforming Assets and Loan Delinquencies  Nonperforming Assets, including OREO and Foreclosed Assets  Nonperforming assets include loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. The major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in Table 30.  In the first quarter of 2013, we completed our alignment of certain nonaccrual and charge-off policies consistent with interagency supervisory guidance on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending. This alignment primarily related to (i) subordinate consumer loans (home equity loans and lines of credit and residential mortgages) where the first-lien loan was 90 days or more past due, (ii) government guaranteed loans where the guarantee may not     38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents   result in collection of substantially all contractual principal and interest and (iii) certain loans with borrowers in or discharged from bankruptcy. In the first quarter of 2013, nonperforming loans increased by $426 million and net charge-offs increased by $134 million as a result of completing the alignment of the aforementioned policies. Additionally, overall delinquencies decreased $395 million due to loans now being reported as either nonperforming or, in the case of loans accounted for under the fair value option, nonaccruing or having been charged off. Certain consumer nonperforming loans were charged-off to the respective collateral value less costs to sell, and any associated allowance at the time of charge-off was reduced to zero. Therefore, the charge-off activity resulted in a reduction to the allowance. As the interagency guidance was adopted, incremental provision for credit losses was recorded if the related loan charge-off exceeded the associated allowance. Subsequent declines in collateral value for these loans will result in additional charge-offs to maintain recorded investment at collateral value less costs to sell.  At September 30, 2014, TDRs included in nonperforming loans were $1.3 billion, or 50%, of total nonperforming loans   compared to $1.5 billion, or 49%, of total nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2013. Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 59% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at September 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013. Home equity TDRs comprise 49% of home equity nonperforming loans at September 30, 2014, down from 54% at December 31, 2013. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC are not returned to accrual status.  At September 30, 2014, our largest nonperforming asset was $36 million in the Real Estate, Rental and Leasing Industry and our average nonperforming loans associated with commercial lending were under $1 million. All of the ten largest outstanding nonperforming assets are from the commercial lending portfolio and represent 19% and 5% of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of September 30, 2014.

As of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, 66% and 64%, respectively, of our OREO and foreclosed assets were comprised of residential related properties.

(b) Charge-offs and valuation adjustments in the 2013 period include $134 million of charge-offs due to the alignment with interagency supervisory guidance discussed in footnote (a) above.  The table above presents nonperforming asset activity during the first nine months of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Nonperforming assets decreased $482 million from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2013, as a result of improvements in both consumer and commercial lending. Consumer lending nonperforming loans decreased $214 million, commercial nonperforming loans declined $137 million and commercial real estate nonperforming loans decreased $123 million. As of September 30, 2014, approximately 89% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which is expected to reduce credit losses and require less reserve in the event of default. As of September 30, 2014, 31% of commercial lending nonperforming loans are contractually current as to both principal and interest obligations. As of September 30, 2014, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 66% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the ALLL. See Note 4 Asset Quality in the   Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on these loans.  Purchased impaired loans are considered performing, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. The accretable yield represents the excess of the expected cash flows on the loans at the measurement date over the carrying value. Generally decreases, other than interest rate decreases for variable rate notes, in the net present value of expected cash flows of individual commercial or pooled purchased impaired loans would result in an impairment charge to the provision for loan losses in the period in which the change is deemed probable. Generally increases in the net present value of purchased impaired loan expected cash flows would first result in a recovery of previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and then an increase to accretable yield for the remaining life of the purchased impaired loans. Total nonperforming loans and assets in the tables above are significantly lower than they would have been due to this accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. This treatment also results in a lower ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and a higher ratio of ALLL to nonperforming loans. See Note 5 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on these loans.  Loan Delinquencies  We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of certain loan portfolios’ asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.  Total early stage loan delinquencies (accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days) decreased from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2013 to $0.8 billion at September 30, 2014. The reduction in both consumer and commercial lending early stage delinquencies resulted from improving credit quality. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional information regarding our nonperforming loan and nonaccrual policies.  Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are referred to as late stage delinquencies. These loans are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral, and/or are in the process of collection, are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 41    Table of Contents  guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed loans. These loans decreased $.3 billion, or 21%, from $1.5 billion at December 31, 2013, to $1.2 billion at September 30, 2014, mainly due to a decline in government insured residential real estate loans of $.2 billion, the majority of which we took possession of and conveyed the real estate, or are in the process of conveyance and claim resolution. The following tables display the delinquency status of our loans at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

On a regular basis our Special Asset Committee closely monitors loans, primarily commercial loans, that are not included in the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrower’s ability to comply with existing repayment terms. These loans totaled $.2 billion at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.  Home Equity Loan Portfolio  Our home equity loan portfolio totaled $35.1 billion as of September 30, 2014, or 17% of the total loan portfolio. Of that total, $20.7 billion, or 59%, was outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $14.4 billion, or 41%, consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans. Approximately 3% of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of September 30, 2014.  As of September 30, 2014, we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 50% of the total portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we currently hold or service the first lien position for approximately an additional 2% of the portfolio. The remaining 48% of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position. The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position, is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien.  Lien position information is generally based upon original LTV at the time of origination. However, after origination PNC is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by PNC is satisfied. Therefore, information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where PNC does not also hold the senior lien. Additionally, PNC is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a PNC first lien. This updated information for both junior and senior liens must be   obtained from external sources, and therefore, PNC has contracted with an industry leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.  We track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original LTVs, updated FICO scores at least quarterly, updated LTVs semi-annually, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status of these loans, as well as the delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower (regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien).  In establishing our ALLL for non-impaired loans, we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans. In accordance with accounting principles, under this methodology, we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses, not lifetime expected losses. The roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state (e.g., 30-59 days past due) to another delinquency state (e.g., 60-89 days past due) and ultimately to charge-off. The roll through to charge-off is based on PNC’s actual loss experience for each type of pool. Each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens. Our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools, used to establish our allowance, include losses on both first and second liens loans.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 43    Table of Contents  Generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20-year amortization term. During the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest. We view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. The risk associated with the borrower’s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our ALLL. Based upon outstanding balances at September 30, 2014, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end.  Table 36: Home Equity Lines of Credit – Draw Period End Dates                In millions   Interest OnlyProduct     Principal andInterest Product     Remainder of 2014   $ 408     $ 97     2015     1,678       580     2016     1,399       448     2017     2,511       614     2018     1,102       832     2019 and thereafter     3,883       5,161     Total (a) (b)   $ 10,981     $ 7,732      (a) Includes all home equity lines of credit that mature in the remainder of 2014 or later, including those with borrowers where we have terminated borrowing privileges.    (b) Includes approximately $37 million, $178 million, $49 million, $59 million, $43 million and $564 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments, including those where we have terminated borrowing privileges, with draw periods scheduled to end in the remainder of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and thereafter, respectively.  Based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at September 30, 2014, for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw (e.g., draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 3% were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5% were 90 days or more past due. Generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. At that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a TDR.  See Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional information.  Loan Modifications and Troubled Debt Restructurings  Consumer Loan Modifications  We modify loans under government and PNC-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. Temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as TDRs. Further, certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs. Additional detail on TDRs is discussed below as well as in Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.  A temporary modification, with a term between 3 and 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. Permanent modification programs primarily include the government-created Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) and PNC-developed HAMP-like modification programs.  For home equity lines of credit, we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance. Examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family or loss of employment. Permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount, but our expectation is the borrower can make payments at a lower amount.  We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers’ needs while mitigating credit losses. Table 37 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans and Table 38 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months, nine months, twelve months and fifteen months after the modification date.     44 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q

The data in this table represents loan modifications completed during the quarters ending March 31, 2013 through March 31, 2014 and represents a vintage look at all quarterly accounts and the number of those modified accounts (for each quarterly vintage) 60 days or more delinquent at six, nine, twelve, and fifteen months after modification. Account totals include active and inactive accounts that were delinquent when they achieved inactive status. Accounts that are no longer 60 days or more delinquent, or were re-modified since prior period, are removed from re-default status in the period they are cured or re-modified.    (b) Vintage refers to the quarter in which the modification occurred.    (c) Reflects September 30, 2014 unpaid principal balances of the re-defaulted accounts for the First Quarter 2014 Vintage at Six Months, for the Fourth Quarter 2013 Vintage at Nine Months, for the Third Quarter 2013 Vintage at Twelve Months, and for the Second Quarter 2013 and prior Vintages at Fifteen Months.    In addition to temporary loan modifications, we may make available to a borrower a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period. Under a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period, there is no change to the loan’s contractual terms so the borrower remains legally responsible for payment of the loan under its original terms.  Payment plans may include extensions, re-ages and/or forbearance plans. All payment plans bring an account current once certain requirements are achieved and are primarily intended to demonstrate a borrower’s renewed willingness and ability to re-pay. Due to the short term nature of the payment plan, there is a minimal impact to the ALLL.  Under a HAMP trial payment period, we establish an alternate payment, generally at an amount less than the contractual payment amount, for the borrower during this short time period. This allows a borrower to demonstrate successful payment performance before permanently restructuring the loan into a HAMP modification. Subsequent to successful borrower performance under the trial payment period, we will capitalize the original contractual amount past due and restructure the loan’s contractual terms, along with bringing the restructured account current. As the borrower is often already delinquent at the time of participation in the HAMP trial payment period, generally enrollment in the program does not significantly increase the ALLL. If the trial payment period is unsuccessful, the loan will be evaluated for further action based upon our existing policies.  Residential conforming and certain residential construction loans have been permanently modified under HAMP or, if they do not qualify for a HAMP modification, under PNC-developed programs, which in some cases may operate similarly to HAMP. These programs first require a reduction of the interest rate followed by an extension of term and, if appropriate, deferral of principal payments. As of   September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, 6,123 accounts with a balance of $.9 billion and 5,834 accounts with a balance of $.9 billion, respectively, of residential real estate loans had been modified under HAMP and were still outstanding on our balance sheet.  We do not re-modify a defaulted modified loan except for subsequent significant life events, as defined by the OCC. A modified loan continues to be classified as a TDR for the remainder of its term regardless of subsequent payment performance.  Commercial Loan Modifications and Payment Plans  Modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the loan term and/or forgiveness of principal. Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Additional detail on TDRs is discussed below as well as in Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.  We have established certain commercial loan modification and payment programs for small business loans, Small Business Administration loans, and investment real estate loans. As of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, $37 million and $47 million, respectively, in loan balances were covered under these modification and payment plan programs. Of these loan balances, $13 million and $16 million have been determined to be TDRs as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.     46 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  Troubled Debt Restructurings  A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, $.9 billion of Consumer loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain government insured or guaranteed loans, were excluded from the TDR population. The comparable amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was $2.4 billion.

Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC are not returned to accrual status.  Total TDRs decreased $123 million, or 4%, during the first nine months of 2014. Nonperforming TDRs totaled $1.3 billion, which represents approximately 50% of total nonperforming loans, and 50% of total TDRs.  TDRs that are performing, including credit card loans, are excluded from nonperforming loans. These TDRs increased $85 million, or 7%, during 2014 to $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2014. This increase reflects the further seasoning and performance of the TDRs. Generally, the accruing category is comprised of loans where borrowers have been performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC are not returned to accrual status. See Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information.  Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit  We recorded $413 million in net charge-offs for the first nine months of 2014, compared to $888 million in the first nine months of 2013. Commercial lending net charge-offs decreased from $227 million in the first nine months of 2013 to $56 million in the first nine months of 2014. Consumer lending net charge-offs decreased from $661 million, which included $134 million due to the impact of alignment with interagency supervisory guidance, in the first nine months of 2013 to $357 million in the first nine months of 2014.

This treatment also results in a lower ratio of net charge-offs to average loans. See Note 5 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on net charge-offs related to these loans.  We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.  We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans   discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.  Reserves allocated to non-impaired commercial loan classes are based on PD and LGD credit risk ratings.  Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our PDs and LGDs, as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non-impaired commercial loans.  The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which continues to demonstrate lower LGD. Further, the large investment grade or equivalent portion of the loan portfolio has performed well and has not been subject to significant deterioration. Additionally, guarantees on loans greater than $1 million and owner guarantees for small business loans do not significantly impact our ALLL.     48 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  Allocations to non-impaired consumer loan classes are based upon a roll-rate model which uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off.  A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative and measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:      •    Industry concentrations and conditions,      •    Recent credit quality trends,      •    Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,      •    Recent macro-economic factors,      •    Model imprecision,      •    Changes in lending policies and procedures,      •    Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and      •    Limitations of available historical data.  Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. At September 30, 2014, we had established reserves of $.9 billion for purchased impaired loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition. See Note 5 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information.  In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL. We have allocated approximately $1.6 billion, or 46%, of the ALLL at September 30, 2014 to the commercial lending category. Consumer lending allocations are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for recent activity. Approximately $1.8 billion, or 54%, of the ALLL at September 30, 2014 has been allocated to these consumer lending categories.  In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is   appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our ALLL.  We refer you to Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolio and establish the allowances.

The provision for credit losses totaled $221 million for the first nine months of 2014 compared to $530 million for the first nine months of 2013. The primary driver of the decrease to the provision was improved overall credit quality, including lower consumer loan delinquencies, and the increasing value of residential real estate which resulted in greater expected cash flows for our purchased impaired loans. For the first nine months of 2014, the provision for commercial lending credit losses increased by $36 million, or 68%, from the first nine months of 2013 reflecting our continual qualitative assessments of the portfolio given the growth trends over the recent quarters. The provision for consumer lending credit losses decreased $345 million, or 72%, from the first nine months of 2013.  At September 30, 2014, total ALLL to total nonperforming loans was 130%. The comparable amount for December 31, 2013 was 117%. These ratios are 84% and 72%, respectively,     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 49    Table of Contents   when excluding the $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of ALLL at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. We have excluded consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by real estate as they are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and not placed on nonperforming status. Additionally, we have excluded purchased impaired loans as they are considered performing regardless of their delinquency status as interest is accreted based on our estimate of expected cash flows and additional allowance is recorded when these cash flows are below recorded investment. See Table 30 within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information.  The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. During the first nine months of 2014, improving asset quality trends, including, but not limited to, delinquency status and improving economic conditions, reduced net charge-offs and overall portfolio growth, combined to result in the ALLL balance declining $.2 billion, or 6% to $3.4 billion as of September 30, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013.  See Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 5 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report regarding changes in the ALLL and in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.  Liquidity Risk Management  Liquidity risk has two fundamental components. The first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available in a stressed environment. We manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company, and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.  Management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity stress event. In addition, management performs a set of liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential stress event. In the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we assume that PNC’s liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure. The simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, accelerated run-off of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund contingent obligations. Risk limits are established within our Enterprise Liquidity   Management Policy and supporting policies. Management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Board of Directors’ Risk Committee regularly review compliance with key established limits.  Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period. Risk limits for parent company liquidity are established within our Enterprise Liquidity Management Policy and supporting policies. Management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Board of Directors’ Risk Committee regularly review compliance with key established limits.  Bank Level Liquidity – Uses  At the bank level, primary contractual obligations include funding loan commitments, satisfying deposit withdrawal requests and maturities and debt service related to bank borrowings. As of September 30, 2014, there were approximately $7.5 billion of bank borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year. We also maintain adequate bank liquidity to meet future potential loan demand and provide for other business needs, as necessary. See the Bank Level Liquidity – Sources section below.  Bank Level Liquidity – Sources  Our largest source of bank liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from our retail and commercial businesses. Total deposits increased to $226.3 billion at September 30, 2014 from $220.9 billion at December 31, 2013, primarily driven by growth in transaction deposits. Assets determined by PNC to be liquid (liquid assets) and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. Borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short and long-term funding sources.  At September 30, 2014, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $30.7 billion and securities available for sale totaling $43.6 billion. Of our total liquid assets of $74.3 billion, we had $17.9 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities.  In addition to the customer deposit base, which has historically provided the single largest source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, the bank also obtains liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding including long-term debt (senior notes and subordinated debt and FHLB advances) and short-term borrowings (Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper issuances and other short-term borrowings).     50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Table of Contents  On January 16, 2014, PNC Bank, N.A. established a new bank note program under which it may from time to time offer up to $25 billion aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes due more than nine months from their date of issue (in the case of senior notes) and due five years or more from their date of issue (in the case of subordinated notes). The $25 billion of notes authorized to be issued and outstanding at any one time includes notes issued by PNC Bank, N.A. prior to January 16, 2014 under the 2004 bank note program and those notes PNC Bank, N.A. has acquired through the acquisition of other banks, in each case for so long as such notes remain outstanding. The terms of the new program do not affect any of the bank notes issued prior to January 16, 2014. At September 30, 2014, PNC Bank, N.A. had $18.3 billion of bank notes outstanding including the following issued during 2014:      •    $1.0 billion of senior notes with a maturity date of January 27, 2017. Interest is payable semi-annually, at a fixed rate of 1.125% on January 27 and July 27 of each year, beginning on July 27, 2014,      •    $750 million of senior notes with a maturity date of January 28, 2019. Interest is payable semi-annually, at a fixed rate of 2.200% on January 28 and July 28 of each year, beginning on July 28, 2014,      •    $1.0 billion of senior extendible floating rate bank notes issued to an affiliate with an initial maturity date of April 15, 2015, subject to the holder’s monthly option to extend, and a final maturity date of April 15, 2016. Interest is payable at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of .235%, which spread is subject to four potential one basis point increases in the event of certain extensions of maturity by the holder. Interest is payable on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2014,      •    $900 million of senior extendible floating rate bank notes with an initial maturity date of July 20, 2015, subject to the holder’s monthly option to extend, and a final maturity date of July 20, 2016. Interest is payable at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of .235%, which spread is subject to four potential one basis point increases in the event of certain extensions of maturity by the holder. Interest is payable on March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20 of each year, beginning on September 20, 2014,      •    $1.0 billion of senior notes with a maturity date of July 2, 2019. Interest is payable semi-annually, at a fixed rate of 2.25% on January 2 and July 2 of each year, beginning on January 2, 2015,      •    $1.0 billion of senior extendible floating rate bank notes issued to an affiliate with an initial maturity date of July 15, 2015, subject to the holder’s monthly option to extend, and a final maturity date of July 15, 2016. Interest is payable at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of .235%, which spread          is subject to four potential one basis point increases in the event of certain extensions of maturity by the holder. Interest is payable on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2014,      •    $300 million of floating rate senior notes with a maturity date of August 1, 2017. Interest is payable at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of .30% per annum, on February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year beginning on November 1, 2014,      •    $1.25 billion of senior extendible floating rate bank notes issued to an affiliate with an initial maturity date of September 18, 2015, subject to the holder’s monthly option to extend, and a final maturity date of August 18, 2016. Interest is payable at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of .235%, which spread is subject to four potential one basis point increases in the event of certain extensions of maturity by the holder. Interest is payable on February 18, May 18, August 18 and November 18 of each year, beginning on November 18, 2014,      •    $500 million of senior notes with a maturity date of October 18, 2017. Interest is payable semi-annually, at a fixed rate of 1.500% on April 18 and October 18 of each year, beginning on April 18, 2015, and      •    $500 million of senior notes with a maturity date of October 18, 2019. Interest is payable semi-annually, at a fixed rate of 2.400% on April 18 and October 18 of each year, beginning on April 18, 2015.  Total senior and subordinated debt of PNC Bank, N.A. increased to $19.6 billion at September 30, 2014 from $14.6 billion at December 31, 2013 primarily due to $8.2 billion in new borrowing less $3.2 billion in calls and maturities.  See Note 19 Subsequent Events in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this Report for information on issuance of senior notes of $500 million and $750 million on October 30, 2014.  PNC Bank, N.A. is a member of the FHLB-Pittsburgh and, as such, has access to advances from FHLB-Pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage loans, other mortgage-related loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities. At September 30, 2014, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $15.1 billion with FHLB-Pittsburgh. Total FHLB borrowings increased to $16.5 billion at September 30, 2014 from $12.9 billion at December 31, 2013 due to $10.2 billion of new issuances offset by $6.6 billion in calls and maturities. The FHLB-Pittsburgh also periodically provides standby letters of credit on behalf of PNC Bank, N.A. to secure certain public deposits. PNC Bank, N.A. began using standby letters of credit issued by the FHLB-Pittsburgh in response to anticipated short-term regulatory standards. If the FHLB-Pittsburgh is required to make payment for a beneficiary’s draw, the payment amount is converted into a collateralized     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 51    Table of Contents   advance to PNC Bank, N.A. At both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, standby letters of credit issued on our behalf by the FHLB-Pittsburgh totaled $6.2 billion.  PNC Bank, N.A. has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2014, there was $4.8 billion outstanding under this program. During the fourth quarter of 2013, PNC finalized the wind down of Market Street Funding LLC (“Market Street”), a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduit administered by PNC Bank, N.A. As part of the wind down process, the commitments and outstanding loans of Market Street were assigned to PNC Bank, N.A., which will fund these commitments and loans by utilizing its diversified funding sources. In conjunction with the assignment of commitments and loans, the associated liquidity facilities were terminated along with the program-level credit enhancement provided to Market Street. The wind down did not have a material impact to PNC’s financial condition or results of operations.  PNC Bank, N.A. can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s (Federal Reserve Bank) discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as the primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. These potential borrowings are secured by commercial loans. At September 30, 2014, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $19.6 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank.  Parent Company Liquidity – Uses  The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. As of September 30, 2014, there were approximately $1.9 billion of parent company borrowings with maturities of less than one year.  Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to PNC shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions. See the Parent Company Liquidity – Sources section below.
