ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   There are no material changes from any of the risk factors previously disclosed in PNC’s 2007 Form 10-K in response to Part I, Item 1A other than the changes previously reported in PNC’s first quarter 2008 Form 10-Q in response to Part II, Item 1A and the addition of the following risk factors:  A continuation of recent turmoil in the financial markets, particularly if economic conditions worsen more than expected, could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  In recent periods, United States and global markets, as well as general economic conditions, have been disrupted and are volatile. This situation is continuing and, since the beginning of the third quarter of 2008, has worsened significantly. The impact of this situation, together with concerns regarding the financial strength of financial institutions, has led to distress in credit markets and issues relating to liquidity among financial institutions. Some financial institutions around the world have failed; others have been forced to seek acquisition partners. The United States and other governments have taken unprecedented steps to try to stabilize the financial system, including investing in financial institutions. Our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by (1) continued or accelerated disruption and volatility in financial markets, (2) continued capital and liquidity concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our counterparties specifically, (3) limitations resulting from further governmental action in an effort to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system, or (4) recessionary conditions that are deeper or last longer than currently anticipated.  Our pending acquisition of National City presents substantial risks and uncertainties, which could limit our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from this transaction.  On October 24, 2008, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire National City through a merger of National City into The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. See Note 17 Subsequent Events included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Part I, Item 1, of this Report for additional information. Closing of this merger is dependent on customary conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals. If we successfully complete this transaction, it presents the following risks to PNC, as well as those more generally described in Part II, Item 1A of our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008:      •    As of the date of this filing, we do not have required regulatory approvals for this transaction. It is        possible that we will receive such approvals subject to conditions that affect the profitability of the acquired businesses to us, including as a result of the antitrust review of this acquisition.      •    Like PNC, National City is a large financial institution and has retail and other banking operations in numerous markets in which PNC has little or no experience. As a result, the integration-related risks are greater than in our recent acquisitions. In particular, successful integration may be hampered by cultural differences between the two organizations.      •    PNC and National City have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate as separate independent entities. The integration process may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources.      •    In recent periods, National City’s results have been impacted negatively by a significant amount of asset impairments. Our results following the acquisition will depend on our ability to dispose of or otherwise appropriately manage these assets.      •    National City’s recent financial performance and resulting stock price performance have led to several lawsuits and governmental investigations, and more may be commenced in the future. Upon its acquisition by PNC, we will bear the risks associated with lawsuits and governmental investigations, the extent and potential adverse impact of which cannot currently be predicted.      •    As a result of this acquisition, the amount of securities we are issuing to the United States Treasury is based on the combined risk-weighted assets of PNC and National City and is greater than the amount we would be able to issue if we did not acquire National City. The risks posed by this issuance are thus greater than they would have been if we did not acquire National City. See discussion below.  Our issuance of securities to the United States Treasury may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders and is slightly dilutive to our common shares. If we are unable previously to redeem the shares, the dividend rate increases substantially after five years.  In connection with our sale of $7.7 billion of senior preferred stock to the Treasury, we will also be issuing the Treasury warrants to purchase approximately $1.1 billion of our common stock. The number of shares will be calculated based on the average market price of our stock for the 20 trading days preceding approval of our issuance (which will also be     84    Table of Contents   the exercise price of the warrants). The terms of the transaction with the Treasury will result in limitations on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our shares. For three years after issuance or until Treasury no longer holds any preferred shares, we will not be able to increase our dividends above current levels ($.66 per common share on a quarterly basis) nor repurchase any of our shares without Treasury approval with limited exceptions, most significantly purchases in connection with benefit plans. Also, we will not be able to pay any dividends at all unless we are current on our dividend payments on the preferred shares. In addition, we anticipate issuing warrants to purchase approximately 17 million of our shares. These restrictions, as well as the slightly dilutive impact of the warrants, may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.  Unless we are able to redeem the preferred stock during the first five years, the cost of this capital will increase substantially at that point, from 5% (almost $400 million annually) to 9% (almost $700 million annually). Depending on market conditions at the time, this increase in dividends could significantly impact our liquidity.  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
