For additional information, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2018 Form 10-K.Business OutlookOur forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our view that:•U.S. economic growth has accelerated over the past two years to above its long-run trend.•Growth is expected to rebound in the second quarter following a soft first quarter 2019, and slow over the remaining course of 2019 and into 2020.•Further gradual improvement in the labor market will occur this year, including job gains and rising wages, which would be a positive indicator for consumer spending. •Trade restrictions and geopolitical concerns are downside risks to the forecast. •Inflation has slowed in early 2019, to below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) 2% objective, but is expected to rise in the second half of the year.•Our baseline forecast is for no change to the federal funds rate in 2019 and 2020, with the rate staying in its current range of 2.25% to 2.50%. For the second quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2019, we expect:•Average loan growth to be up approximately 1%;•Net interest income to increase by low-single digits, on a percentage basis;•Fee income to increase by mid-single digits, on a percentage basis. Fee income consists of asset management, consumer services, corporate services, residential mortgage and service charges on deposits;•The quarterly run rate of other noninterest income to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million, excluding net securities gains (losses) and Visa activity;•Provision for credit losses to be between $125 million and $200 million; and•Noninterest expense to increase by low-single digits, on a percentage basis. For full year 2019 compared to full year 2018, we expect:•Average loan growth to be between 3% and 4%;•Revenue growth on the higher end of low-single digits, on a percentage basis;•Noninterest expense to increase on the lower end of low-single digits, on a percentage basis; •The effective tax rate to be approximately 17%; and•To generate positive operating leverage. 4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QSee the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2018 Form 10-K for other factors that could cause future events to differ, perhaps materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEWOur Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.Net income for the first quarter of 2019 was $1.3 billion, or $2.61 per diluted common share, an increase of 3% compared to $1.2 billion, or $2.43 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2018. The increase was driven by a 4% increase in revenue, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and a 2% increase in noninterest expense. Higher revenue in the comparison reflected a 5% increase in net interest income and a 3% increase in noninterest income.

To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margins by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP on the Consolidated Income Statement. For more information, see Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income (Non-GAAP) in the Statistical Information (Unaudited) section of this Report.Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report for additional information.Net interest income increased by $114 million, or 5%, in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the first quarter of 2018. This increase reflected higher loan and securities yields and balances, partially offset by higher deposit and borrowing costs and balances. Net interest margin increased 7 basis points reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Average investment securities increased $7.7 billion, or 10%, driven by net purchase activity of agency residential mortgage-backed securities of $4.4 billion and U.S. Treasury and government agency securities of $3.9 billion. Average investment securities increased to 24% of average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 23% for the first quarter of 2018.Average loans grew $7.4 billion, or 3%, reflecting an increase in average commercial lending of $6.5 billion, or 4%, driven by growth in the Corporate Banking and Business Credit businesses in our Corporate & Institutional Banking segment. Average consumer lending increased $.9 billion, or 1%. Growth in residential real estate, automobile and credit card was partially offset by declines in home equity and education loans. Lower home equity loans reflected paydowns and payoffs exceeding new originated volume. In addition, runoff of brokered home equity and government guaranteed education loans contributed to the The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 5declines. Average loans represented 68% of average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 67% for the first quarter of 2018.Average interest-earning deposits with banks decreased $10.7 billion, or 41%, reflecting lower average balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank as investment of liquidity continued.Average interest-bearing deposits grew $12.4 billion, or 7%, reflecting overall deposit and customer growth. Additionally, the increase reflects a shift of commercial deposits to interest-bearing from noninterest-bearing deposits, which declined $5.8 billion to $71.4 billion, as deposit rates have risen. In total, average interest-bearing deposits increased to 77% of average interest-bearing liabilities compared to 75% for the first quarter of 2018.Further details regarding average loans and deposits are included in the Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review.Noninterest IncomeTable 3: Noninterest Income Three months ended March 31       Change Dollars in millions 2019 2018 $ % Noninterest income         Asset management $437 $455 $(18) (4)% Consumer services 371 357 14 4 % Corporate services 462 429 33 8 % Residential mortgage 65 97 (32) (33)% Service charges on deposits 168 167 1 1 % Other 308 245 63 26 % Total noninterest income $1,811$1,750$61 3 %  Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 42% for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 43% for the same period in 2018.Asset management revenue declined due to changes in the mix of assets under management and lower earnings from our equity investment in BlackRock. PNC's discretionary client assets under management increased to $158 billion at March 31, 2019 compared to $148 billion at March 31, 2018.Growth in consumer service fees resulted from increases in debit card, credit card, net of rewards, and brokerage fees reflecting continued momentum in customer activity in both transaction trends and customer growth. Higher corporate services revenue was primarily driven by growth in merger and acquisition advisory fees of $15 million and treasury management product revenue of $14 million. Residential mortgage revenue decreased as a result of a negative adjustment for residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, compared with a benefit in first quarter 2018, and lower loan sales revenue.The increase in other noninterest income was largely attributable to higher gains on asset sales and higher revenue from private equity investments, partially offset by negative derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B common shares of $31 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $2 million in the first quarter of 2018. Provision For Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses increased $97 million to $189 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $92 million in the first quarter of 2018 reflecting loan growth, including new loans and increased utilization, and reserve increases in the auto loan portfolio. The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QNoninterest ExpenseTable 4: Noninterest Expense  Three months ended March 31       Change Dollars in millions 2019 2018 $ % Noninterest expense         Personnel $1,414 $1,354 $60 4 % Occupancy 215 218 (3) (1)% Equipment 273 273 — — Marketing 65 55 10 18 % Other 611 627 (16) (3)% Total noninterest expense $2,578 $2,527 $51 2 %  Noninterest expense increased in the comparison as investments in support of business growth were reflected in higher personnel and marketing expense, which included costs for PNC's national retail digital strategy. These increases were offset in part by a decrease in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance as a result of the elimination of the surcharge assessment. PNC continued to focus on disciplined expense management, and for full-year 2019 we have a goal of $300 million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program, which we expect will help fund a portion of our strategic investments.Effective Income Tax RateThe effective income tax rate was 16.3% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 17.0% in the first quarter of 2018.

In Corporate Banking, commercial loans increased primarily driven by asset-backed finance securitizations as well as increased lending to large and midsize corporate clients. In Business Credit, commercial loans increased driven by new originations and higher utilization. In the Real Estate business, increased multifamily agency warehouse lending also contributed to the growth in commercial loans.For commercial loans by industry and commercial real estate loans by geography, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review.Consumer lending balances decreased as lower home equity loans, education loans, and credit card balances were partially offset by growth in residential real estate and automobile loans.Home equity loans declined as paydowns and payoffs exceeded new originated volume and brokered home equity loans continued to runoff. Education loans declined primarily due to runoff of the guaranteed education loan portfolio. Credit card balances declined due to seasonally lower consumer spending.Residential real estate loans increased primarily from originations of nonconforming loans, which are loans that do not meet government agency standards as a result of exceeding agency conforming loan limits. The growth in automobile loans was due to higher indirect auto loans as a result of continued new loan growth and expansion into franchised dealers in new markets.For information on home equity and residential real estate loans, including by geography, and automobile loans, see Loan Portfolio Characteristics and Analysis in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in this Financial Review.See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review, Note 3 Asset Quality and Note 4 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report, and Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our loan portfolio.8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QInvestment SecuritiesInvestment securities of $83.9 billion at March 31, 2019 increased $1.2 billion, or 1%, compared to December 31, 2018, driven by net purchases of U.S. Treasury and government agency securities of $.9 billion and asset-backed securities of $.6 billion, partially offset by a decline of other securities of $.5 billion.The level and composition of the investment securities portfolio fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan and deposit growth, and balance sheet management activities. We manage our investment securities portfolio to optimize returns, while providing a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.Table 7: Investment Securities  March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Ratings (a) as of March 31, 2019 Dollars in millionsAmortizedCost FairValue AmortizedCost FairValue AAA/AA A BBB BB and Lower NoRating U.S. Treasury and government agencies$19,621 $19,778 $18,862 $18,863 100%     Agency residential mortgage-backed44,866 44,750 45,153 44,407 100%     Non-agency residential mortgage-backed1,983 2,278 2,076 2,365 13% 2% 2% 48% 35% Agency commercial mortgage-backed2,705 2,681 2,773 2,720 100%     Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed (b)3,304 3,308 3,177 3,145 88% 5%   7% Asset-backed (c)5,682 5,739 5,115 5,155 88% 3% 3% 5% 1% Other (d)5,181 5,325 5,670 5,753 72% 15% 9% 1% 3% Total investment securities (e)$83,342 $83,859 $82,826 $82,408 95% 1% 1% 2% 1% (a)Ratings percentages allocated based on amortized cost.(b)Collateralized primarily by retail properties, office buildings, lodging properties and multi-family housing.(c)Collateralized primarily by corporate debt, government guaranteed education loans and other consumer credit products.(d)Includes state and municipal securities.(e)Includes available for sale and held to maturity securities, which are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value and amortized cost, respectively.Table 7 presents the distribution of our total investment securities portfolio by amortized cost and fair value, as well as by credit rating. We have included credit ratings information because we believe that the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our risk-based regulatory capital ratios under the current regulatory capital rules. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. The duration of investment securities was 3.1 years at March 31, 2019. We estimate that at March 31, 2019 the effective duration of investment securities was 3.3 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.9 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Based on expected prepayment speeds, the weighted-average expected maturity of the investment securities portfolio was 4.9 years at March 31, 2019 compared to 5.3 years at December 31, 2018.Table 8: Weighted-Average Expected Maturities of Mortgage and Asset-Backed Debt Securities March 31, 2019Years Agency residential mortgage-backed5.6 Non-agency residential mortgage-backed6.2 Agency commercial mortgage-backed4.1 Non-agency commercial mortgage-backed2.7 Asset-backed2.1 Additional information regarding our investment securities is included in Note 5 Investment Securities and Note 6 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 9Funding SourcesTable 9: Details of Funding Sources  March 31 December 31 Change Dollars in millions2019 2018 $% Deposits       Noninterest-bearing$71,606 $73,960 $(2,354)(3)% Interest-bearing     Money market53,037 53,368 (331)(1)% Demand65,643 65,211 4321 % Savings61,315 56,793 4,5228 % Time deposits19,620 18,507 1,1136 % Total interest-bearing deposits199,615 193,879 5,7363 % Total deposits271,221 267,839 3,3821 % Borrowed funds     Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings20,501 21,501 (1,000)(5)% Bank notes and senior debt25,598 25,018 5802 % Subordinated debt5,977 5,895 821 % Other7,784 5,005 2,77956 % Total borrowed funds59,860 57,419 2,4414 % Total funding sources$331,081 $325,258 $5,8232 % Total deposits increased as growth in interest-bearing deposits was partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest-bearing deposits reflected consumer deposit growth, including from the national retail digital strategy. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased due to seasonal declines in commercial deposits as well as a shift of commercial deposits to interest-bearing.Borrowed funds increased due to higher federal funds purchased, included in other borrowed funds, and bank notes and senior debt, which were partially offset by decreases in FHLB borrowings. The level and composition of borrowed funds fluctuates over time based on many factors including market conditions, loan, investment securities and deposit growth, and capital considerations. We manage our borrowed funds to provide a reliable source of liquidity for our banking and other activities, considering our LCR and other internal and external guidelines and constraints.See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our 2019 liquidity and capital activities.Shareholders’ EquityTotal shareholders’ equity was $48.5 billion at March 31, 2019, an increase of $.8 billion compared to December 31, 2018. The increase resulted from net income of $1.3 billion and higher AOCI of $.7 billion related to net unrealized securities gains, partially offset by common share repurchases of $725 million and common and preferred dividends of $438 million.Common shares outstanding were 452 million and 457 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, as repurchases of 5.9 million shares during the period were partially offset by stock-based compensation activity. BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEWWe have four reportable business segments:•Retail Banking•Corporate & Institutional Banking•Asset Management Group•BlackRockBusiness segment results and a description of each business are included in Note 14 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report. Certain amounts included in this Business Segments Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 14, primarily due to the presentation in this Financial Review of business net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTotal business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category as shown in Table 71 in Note 14 Segment Reporting in Item 1 of this Report. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, exited businesses, and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments’ results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.Retail BankingRetail Banking's core strategy is to acquire and retain customers who maintain their primary checking and transaction relationships with us. We seek to deepen relationships by meeting the broad range of our customers’ financial needs with savings, liquidity, lending, investment and retirement solutions. A strategic priority for us is to differentiate the customer experience and drive transformation and automation. A key element of our strategy is to expand the use of lower-cost alternative distribution channels, with an emphasis on digital capabilities, while continuing to optimize the traditional branch network. In addition, we have a disciplined process to continually improve the engagement of both our employees and customers, which is a strong driver of customer growth, retention and relationship expansion. In 2018, we launched our national retail digital strategy designed to grow customers with digitally-led banking and an ultra-thin branch network in markets outside of our existing retail branch network.Table 10: Retail Banking Table (Unaudited)       Three months ended March 31    Change Dollars in millions, except as noted2019 2018 $% Income Statement       Net interest income$1,349 $1,218 $13111 % Noninterest income595 635 (40)(6)% Total revenue1,944 1,853 915 % Provision for credit losses128 69 5986 % Noninterest expense1,468 1,456 121 % Pretax earnings348 328 206 % Income taxes84 79 56 % Earnings$264 $249 $156 % Average Balance Sheet       Loans held for sale$441 $652 $(211)(32)% Loans       Consumer       Home equity$22,990 $24,608 $(1,618)(7)% Automobile14,608 13,105 1,50311 % Education3,816 4,409 (593)(13)% Credit cards6,204 5,619 58510 % Other2,068 1,765 30317 % Total consumer49,686 49,506 180— Commercial and commercial real estate10,461 10,527 (66)(1)% Residential mortgage15,034 13,420 1,61412 % Total loans$75,181 $73,453 $1,7282 % Total assets$91,255 $88,734 $2,5213 % Deposits       Noninterest-bearing demand$30,389 $29,779 $6102 % Interest-bearing demand42,477 41,939 5381 % Money market26,773 32,330 (5,557)(17)% Savings53,100 43,838 9,26221 % Certificates of deposit12,381 12,082 2992 % Total deposits$165,120 $159,968 $5,1523 % Performance Ratios       Return on average assets1.17% 1.14%    Noninterest income to total revenue31% 34%    Efficiency76% 79%    The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 11Three months ended March 31    Change Dollars in millions, except as noted2019 2018 $% Supplemental Noninterest Income Information       Consumer services$277 $266 $114 % Brokerage$89 $86 $33 % Residential mortgage$65 $97 $(32)(33)% Service charges on deposits$162 $160 $21 % Residential Mortgage Information       Residential mortgage servicing statistics (in billions, except as noted) (a)       Serviced portfolio balance (b)$123 $125 $(2)(2)% Serviced portfolio acquisitions$1 $1 —— MSR asset value (b)$1.1 $1.3 $(.2)(15)% MSR capitalization value (in basis points) (b)92 101 (9)(9)% Servicing income: (in millions)       Servicing fees, net (c)$53 $51 $24 % Mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge$(9) $9 $(18)(200)% Residential mortgage loan statistics       Loan origination volume (in billions)$1.7 $1.7 —— Loan sale margin percentage2.35% 2.83%    Percentage of originations represented by:       Purchase volume (d)56% 56%    Refinance volume44% 44%    Other Information (b)       Customer-related statistics (average)       Non-teller deposit transactions (e)57% 54%    Digital consumer customers (f)68% 64%    Credit-related statistics       Nonperforming assets (g)$1,109 $1,131 $(22)(2)% Net charge-offs$132 $100 $3232 % Other statistics       ATMs9,112 9,047 651 % Branches (h)2,347 2,442 (95)(4)% Brokerage account client assets (in billions) (i)$51 $49 $24 % (a)Represents mortgage loan servicing balances for third parties and the related income.(b)Presented as of March 31, except for customer-related statistics, which are averages for the three months ended, and net charge-offs, which are for the three months ended.(c)Servicing fees net of impact of decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan prepayments and loans that were paid down or paid off during the period.

(h)Excludes stand-alone mortgage offices and satellite offices (e.g., drive-ups, electronic branches and retirement centers) that provide limited products and/or services.(i)Includes cash and money market balances.Retail Banking earned $264 million in the first three months of 2019 compared with $249 million for the same period in 2018. The increase in earnings was attributable to higher net interest income partially offset by lower noninterest income and increased noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits.The decrease in noninterest income was largely attributed to lower residential mortgage noninterest income, reflecting a negative adjustment for residential mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge, compared with a benefit in first quarter 2018, and a decline in loan sales revenue. The decline in loan sales revenue reflected lower gain on sales margins as a result of increased competition in the marketplace. In addition, the impact of negative derivative fair value adjustments related to Visa Class B common shares of $31 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared with $2 million in the same period in 2018 also contributed to the decrease in noninterest income. These decreases were partially offset by growth in consumer service fees, including higher debit and credit card fees, as well as higher brokerage fees and service charges on deposits.12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QProvision for credit losses increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to portfolio growth and reserve increases in the auto portfolio.Higher noninterest expense primarily resulted from an increase in marketing activity, customer-related transactional costs and investments in equipment and technology.The deposit strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances, executing on market-specific deposit growth strategies and providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. In the first quarter of 2019, average total deposits increased compared to the same period in 2018, as both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand deposits increased. Savings deposits increased, reflecting, in part, a shift from money market deposits to relationship-based savings products as well as growth in consumer deposits, including from the national retail digital strategy. Certificates of deposit increased slightly due to shifts in consumer preferences to time deposits.Retail Banking average total loans increased in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the same period in 2018.•Average residential mortgages increased as a result of growth in nonconforming residential mortgage loans.•Average automobile loans increased primarily due to strong new indirect auto loan volumes, including in our Southeast and new markets, as well as growth in direct auto loans. •Average credit card balances increased as we continued to focus on our long-term objective of deepening penetration within our existing customer base.•Average home equity loans decreased as paydowns and payoffs on loans exceeded new originated volume.•Average education loans decreased driven by a decline in the runoff portfolio of government guaranteed education loans.•Average commercial and commercial real estate loans declined as paydowns and payoffs on loans exceeded new volume.Retail Banking continues to enhance the customer experience with refinements to product and service offerings that drive value for consumers and small businesses. We are focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers by providing a broad range of liquidity, banking and investment products. In 2018, Retail Banking launched its national retail digital strategy by offering a high yield savings account in markets outside of our existing retail branch network and opened a retail location in Kansas City. Deposit balances generated through the national retail digital strategy totaled $1.2 billion as of March 31, 2019.Retail Banking continued to focus on its strategy of transforming the customer experience through transaction migration, branch network and home lending transformations and multi-channel engagement and service strategies.•Approximately 68% of consumer customers used non-teller channels for the majority of their transactions in the first three months of 2019 compared with 64% for the same period in 2018.•Deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 57% of total deposit transactions versus 54% for the same period in 2018.Retail Banking continues to make progress on its multi-year initiative to redesign the home lending process. In 2019, the home equity origination cycle will be the focus as we enhance current capabilities in order to improve speed of delivery and convenience for customers.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 13Corporate & Institutional Banking Corporate & Institutional Banking’s strategy is to be the leading relationship-based provider of traditional banking products and services to its customers through the economic cycles. We aim to grow our market share and drive higher returns by delivering value-added solutions that help our clients better run their organizations, all while maintaining prudent risk and expense management. We continue to focus on building client relationships where the risk-return profile is attractive.Table 11: Corporate & Institutional Banking Table(Unaudited)       Three months ended March 31    Change Dollars in millions2019 2018 $% Income Statement       Net interest income$898 $882 $162 % Noninterest income576 547 295 % Total revenue1,474 1,429 453 % Provision for credit losses71 41 3073 % Noninterest expense686 653 335 % Pretax earnings717 735 (18)(2)% Income taxes165 172 (7)(4)% Earnings$552 $563 $(11)(2)% Average Balance Sheet       Loans held for sale$347 $1,189 $(842)(71)% Loans       Commercial$108,641 $100,802 $7,8398 % Commercial real estate25,971 26,732 (761)(3)% Equipment lease financing7,264 7,845 (581)(7)% Total commercial lending141,876 135,379 6,4975 % Consumer20 77 (57)(74)% Total loans$141,896 $135,456 $6,4405 % Total assets$157,169 $151,909 $5,2603 % Deposits       Noninterest-bearing demand$39,551 $45,896 $(6,345)(14)% Money market25,630 23,406 2,22410 % Other23,374 18,592 4,78226 % Total deposits$88,555 $87,894 $6611 % Performance Ratios       Return on average assets1.42% 1.50%    Noninterest income to total revenue39% 38%    Efficiency47% 46%    Other Information       Consolidated revenue from: (a)       Treasury Management (b)$445 $419 $266 % Capital Markets (b)$246 $258 $(12)(5)% Commercial mortgage banking activities:       Commercial mortgage loans held for sale (c)$15 $14 $17 % Commercial mortgage loan servicing income (d)54 55 (1)(2)% Commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge (e)5 4 125 % Total$74 $73 $11 % Commercial mortgage servicing rights asset value (f)$681 $723 $(42)(6)% Average Loans by C&IB business (g)       Corporate Banking$71,089 $65,548 $5,5418 % Real Estate36,357 37,252 (895)(2)% Business Credit21,728 20,197 1,5318 % Commercial Banking8,118 8,118 —— Other4,604 4,341 2636 % Total average loans$141,896 $135,456 $6,4405 % Credit-related statistics       Nonperforming assets (f) (h)$388 $508 $(120)(24)% Net charge-offs$5 $9 $(4)(44)% 14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q(a)See the additional revenue discussion regarding treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities in the Product Revenue section of this Corporate & Institutional Banking section.(b)Includes amounts reported in net interest income and noninterest income.(c)Includes other noninterest income for valuations on commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, derivative valuations, originations fees, gains on sale of loans held for sale and net interest income on loans held for sale.

The decrease was primarily due to higher noninterest expense and a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher revenue.Net interest income increased in the comparison, primarily due to wider interest rate spreads on the value of deposits and higher average loan balances, partially offset by narrower interest rate spreads on the value of loans.Growth in noninterest income was primarily driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and treasury management product revenue. An equity investment gain in the first quarter of 2019 also contributed to the increase in noninterest income. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue from credit valuations on customer-related derivative activities.The increase in provision for credit losses reflected loan growth, including new loans and increased utilization. Overall, credit quality remained stable, as nonperforming assets and net charge-offs declined in the comparison. Noninterest expense increased largely due to investments in strategic initiatives and variable costs associated with increased business activity. Average loans increased primarily due to strong growth in Corporate Banking and Business Credit:•Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, and government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business grew in the comparison reflecting increased lending to large and mid-sized corporate clients as well as strong production in asset-backed financing.•PNC Real Estate provides banking, financing and servicing solutions for commercial real estate clients across the country. Average loans for this business decreased primarily driven by project loan payoffs, partially offset by higher commercial mortgage balances. •PNC Business Credit provides asset-based lending. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets. Average loans for this business increased in the comparison as increased utilization and new originations were partially offset by payoffs.•Commercial Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to smaller corporations and businesses. Average loans for this business were relatively unchanged. The deposit strategy of Corporate & Institutional Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing and focused on growing and retaining relationship-based balances over time, executing on customer and segment-specific deposit growth strategies and continuing to provide funding and liquidity to PNC. Average total deposits increased in the comparison driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits reflecting, in part, a shift from noninterest-bearing deposits in the rising rate environment. We continue to monitor and balance the relationship between increases to rates paid and the overall profitability of our deposit balances.Corporate & Institutional Banking is expanding its Corporate Banking business, focused on the middle market and larger sectors. We plan to expand into the Boston and Phoenix markets in 2019. This follows expansion into Denver, Houston and Nashville in 2018 and Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis in 2017. These locations complement Corporate & Institutional Banking national businesses with a significant presence in these cities, and build on past successes in the markets where PNC’s retail banking presence was limited, such as in the Southeast. Our full suite of commercial products and services is offered in these locations. Product RevenueIn addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a business segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 11 includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 15The Treasury Management business provides payables, receivables, deposit and account services, liquidity and investments, and online and mobile banking products and services to our clients. Treasury management revenue is reported in noninterest income and net interest income. Noninterest income includes treasury management product revenue less earnings credits provided to customers on compensating deposit balances used to pay for products and services. Net interest income primarily includes revenue from all treasury management customer deposit balances. Compared with the first three months of 2018, treasury management revenue increased primarily due to interest rate spread expansion on deposit balances and higher product revenue.Capital markets-related products and services include foreign exchange, derivatives, securities underwriting, loan syndications, mergers and acquisitions advisory and equity capital markets advisory related services. Capital markets-related revenue decreased in the comparison, primarily due to lower revenue from credit valuations on customer-related derivatives activities, loan syndications and corporate securities, partially offset by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees.Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income) and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges. Total revenue from commercial mortgage banking activities was stable with the first quarter of 2018.16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QAsset Management GroupAsset Management Group is focused on being a premier bank-held individual and institutional asset manager in each of the markets it serves. The business seeks to deliver high quality banking, trust and investment management services to our high net worth, ultra high net worth and institutional client sectors through a broad array of products and services.

Earnings decreased due to a decline in revenue and an increase in noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses.Lower revenue was driven by a decline in asset management fees due to changes in the mix of assets under management. Noninterest expense increased primarily attributable to higher personnel expenses.Asset Management Group’s discretionary client assets under management increased in the comparison to the prior year, primarily attributable to higher equity markets as of March 31, 2019 and the impact of net business activities.

Additionally, our 2018 Form 10-K provides an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, liquidity and capital, market, operational and compliance.Credit Risk Management See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding credit risk.18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QLoan Portfolio Characteristics and AnalysisTable 14: Details of Loans In billionsWe use several asset quality indicators, as further detailed in Note 3 Asset Quality, to monitor and measure our exposure to credit risk within our loan portfolio. The following provides additional information about our significant loan classes.CommercialCommercial loans comprised 53% and 52% of our total loan portfolio at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The majority of our commercial loans are secured by collateral that provides a secondary source of repayment for the loan should the borrower experience cash generation difficulties. Examples of this collateral include short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory and securities, and long-lived assets, such as equipment, real estate and other business assets. We actively manage our commercial loans to assess any changes (both positive and negative) in the level of credit risk at both the borrower and portfolio level. To evaluate the level of credit risk, we assign internal risk ratings reflecting our estimates of the borrower’s probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) for each related credit facility. This two-dimensional credit risk rating methodology provides granularity in the risk monitoring process and is updated on an ongoing basis through our credit risk management processes. In addition to continual monitoring of the level of credit risk, we also monitor concentrations of credit risk pertaining to both specific industries and geography that may exist in our portfolio. Our portfolio remains stable and well-diversified as shown in the following table which provides a breakout of our commercial loans by industry classification (classified based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)).Table 15: Commercial Loans by Industry  March 31, 2019  December 31, 2018 Dollars in millionsAmount % of Total  Amount % of Total Commercial         Manufacturing$22,575 18%  $21,207 18% Retail/wholesale trade21,655 18  20,850 18 Service providers15,266 12  14,869 13 Real estate related (a)12,287 10  12,312 11 Financial services10,475 9  9,500 8 Health care8,731 7  8,886 8 Transportation and warehousing6,744 5  5,781 5 Other industries25,260 21  23,429 19 Total commercial loans$122,993 100%  $116,834 100% (a) Includes loans to customers in the real estate and construction industries.Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate loans comprised $6.3 billion of real estate project loans, $6.9 billion of intermediate term financing loans and $14.9 billion related to commercial mortgages as of March 31, 2019. Comparable amounts were $6.6 billion, $7.1 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 19We monitor credit risk associated with our commercial real estate loans similar to commercial loans by analyzing PD and LGD. Additionally, risks associated with these types of credit activities tend to be correlated to the loan structure, collateral location, project progress and business environment. These attributes are also monitored and utilized in assessing credit risk. The portfolio is geographically diverse due to the nature of our business involving clients throughout the U.S. The following table presents our commercial real estate loans by geographic market and property type.

Comparable amounts were $15.5 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2018. We track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original loan-to-value ratios (LTV), updated FICO scores at least quarterly, updated LTVs at least semi-annually, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any related mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon the loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV, lien position and geographic concentration.The portfolio is primarily originated within markets located in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast, with less than 5% of the portfolio in states outside of those markets at March 31, 2019. The credit quality of newly originated loans over the last twelve months was strong overall as evidenced by a weighted-average LTV on originations of 67% and a weighted-average FICO score of 772.The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we hold the first lien position is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position, but do not hold the first lien. Lien position information is generally based upon original LTV at the time of origination. We use an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 20The following table presents our home equity loans by geographic market and lien type.Table 17: Home Equity Loans by Geography and by Lien Priority March 31, 2019  December 31, 2018 Dollars in millionsAmount % of Total  Amount % of Total Geography         Pennsylvania$5,989 23%  $6,160 24% New Jersey3,837 15  3,935 15 Ohio3,012 12  3,095 12 Illinois1,587 6  1,634 6 Maryland1,450 6  1,481 6 Michigan1,311 5  1,340 5 Florida1,216 5  1,227 5 North Carolina1,126 4  1,161 4 Kentucky1,012 4  1,040 4 Indiana826 3  845 3 All other states4,134 17  4,205 16 Total home equity loans$25,500 100%  $26,123 100% Lien type         1st lien  58%    58% 2nd lien  42    42 Total  100%    100% Residential Real Estate Residential real estate loans primarily consisted of residential mortgage loans at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

For internal reporting and risk management we also segment the mortgage portfolio into pools based on product type (e.g., nonconforming, conforming). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we also segment the portfolio based upon loan delinquency, nonperforming status, modification and bankruptcy status, FICO scores, LTV and geographic concentrations. Loan performance is evaluated by source originators and loan servicers.The credit quality of newly originated loans that we retained on our balance sheet over the last twelve months was strong overall as evidenced by a weighted-average LTV on originations of 71% and a weighted-average FICO score of 769.

Residential mortgage loans underwritten to government agency standards, including conforming loan amount limits, are typically sold 21 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Qwith servicing retained by us. We also originate nonconforming residential mortgage loans that do not meet government agency standards, which we retain on our balance sheet. The nonconforming residential mortgage portfolio had strong credit quality at March 31, 2019 with an average original LTV of 70% and an average original FICO score of 772. Our portfolio of nonconforming residential mortgage loans totaled $13.1 billion at March 31, 2019 with 32% located in California. AutomobileWithin auto loans, $13.2 billion resided in the indirect auto portfolio while $1.5 billion were in the direct auto portfolio as of March 31, 2019. Comparable amounts as of December 31, 2018 were $12.9 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The indirect auto portfolio relates to loan applications originated through franchised automobile dealers. This business is strategically aligned with our core retail banking business.We continue to focus on borrowers with strong credit profiles as evidenced by a weighted-average loan origination FICO score over the last twelve months of 742 for indirect auto loans and 763 for direct auto loans. The weighted-average term of loan originations over the last twelve months was 74 months for indirect auto loans and 62 months for direct auto loans. We offer both new and used automobile financing to customers through our various channels. At both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the portfolio was composed of 53% new vehicle loans and 47% used vehicle loans.The auto loan portfolio's performance is measured monthly, including updated collateral values that are obtained monthly and updated FICO scores that are obtained at least quarterly. For internal reporting and risk management, we analyze the portfolio by product channel and product type and regularly evaluate default and delinquency experience. As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the portfolio by loan structure, collateral attributes and credit metrics which include FICO score, LTV and term.Nonperforming Assets and Loan DelinquenciesNonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), other real estate owned (OREO) and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Form 10-K. A summary of the major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in Table 19. See Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further detail of nonperforming asset categories.Table 19: Nonperforming Assets by Type  March 31, 2019December 31, 2018 ChangeDollars in millions$ %Nonperforming loans      Commercial lending$430$432 $(2) —Consumer lending (a)1,2231,262 (39) (3)%Total nonperforming loans1,6531,694 (41) (2)%OREO and foreclosed assets132114 18 16 %Total nonperforming assets$1,785$1,808 $(23) (1)%TDRs included in nonperforming loans$869$863 $6 1 %Percentage of total nonperforming loans53%51%    Nonperforming loans to total loans.71%.75%    Nonperforming assets to total loans, OREO and foreclosed assets.77%.80%    Nonperforming assets to total assets.45%.47%    Allowance for loan and lease losses to total nonperforming loans163%155%    (a)Excludes most consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate, which are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and are not placed on nonperforming status.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 22Table 20: Change in Nonperforming Assets In millions 2019 2018 January 1 $1,808 $2,035 New nonperforming assets 287 249 Charge-offs and valuation adjustments (164) (137) Principal activity, including paydowns and payoffs (92) (81) Asset sales and transfers to loans held for sale (13) (29) Returned to performing status (41) (33) March 31 $1,785 $2,004 As of March 31, 2019, approximately 87% of total nonperforming loans were secured by collateral which lessened reserve requirements and is expected to reduce credit losses in the event of default. As of March 31, 2019, commercial lending nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 72% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the Allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL).Within consumer lending nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprised 77% and 81% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Home equity TDRs comprised 47% of home equity nonperforming loans at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of both principal and interest payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status.At March 31, 2019, our largest nonperforming asset was $35 million in the Information industry and the ten largest individual nonperforming assets represented 11% of total nonperforming assets.Loan DelinquenciesWe regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 21: Accruing Loans Past Due (a)   Amount    Percentage of Total Loans Outstanding   March 312019 December 312018 Change March 312019 December 312018 Dollars in millions $ %  Early stage loan delinquencies             Accruing loans past due 30 to 59 days $634 $585 $49 8 % .27% .26% Accruing loans past due 60 to 89 days 212 271 (59) (22)% .09% .12% Total 846 856 (10) (1)% .36% .38% Late stage loan delinquencies             Accruing loans past due 90 days or more 590 629 (39) (6)% .25% .28% Total $1,436 $1,485 $(49) (3)% .62% .66% (a)Past due loan amounts include government insured or guaranteed loans of $.6 billion at March 31, 2019 and $.7 billion at December 31, 2018.Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral and are in the process of collection, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed loans.Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan ModificationsTroubled Debt RestructuringsA TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 23collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from court imposed concessions (e.g., a Chapter 7 bankruptcy where the debtor is discharged from personal liability to us and a court approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment plan).Table 22: Summary of Troubled Debt Restructurings (a)  March 312019 December 312018 Change Dollars in millions $ % Total commercial lending $456 $409 $47 11 % Total consumer lending 1,412 1,442 (30) (2)% Total TDRs $1,868 $1,851 $17 1 % Nonperforming $869 $863 $6 1 % Accruing (b) 999 988 11 1 % Total TDRs $1,868 $1,851 $17 1 % (a)Amounts in table represent recorded investment, which includes the unpaid principal balance plus net accounting adjustments, less any charge-offs. Recorded investment does not include any associated valuation allowance.(b)Accruing loans include consumer credit card loans and loans that have demonstrated a period of at least six months of performance under the restructured terms and are excluded from nonperforming loans.Excluded from TDRs are $1.1 billion of consumer loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain government insured or guaranteed loans at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Nonperforming TDRs represented approximately 53% and 51% of total nonperforming loans at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, while representing 47% of total TDRs at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The remaining portion of TDRs represents TDRs that have been returned to accrual status after performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months.See Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on TDRs. See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2018 Form 10-K for information related to loan modifications.Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of CreditWe maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. Our total ALLL of $2.7 billion at March 31, 2019 consisted of $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes are periodically updated.Reserves are established for non-impaired commercial loan classes based primarily on PD and LGD.Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers, which generally demonstrate lower LGD compared to loans not secured by collateral. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our PDs and LGDs as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment.Allowances for non-impaired consumer loan classes are primarily based upon transition matrices, including using a roll-rate model. The roll-rate model uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off.We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential real estate secured and consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QA portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:•Industry concentrations and conditions,•Changes in market conditions,•Recent credit quality trends,•Recent loss experience in particular portfolios, including specific and unique events,•Recent macro-economic factors,•Model imprecision,•Changes in lending policies and procedures,•Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and•Limitations of available historical data.Our determination of the ALLL for non-impaired loans is sensitive to the risk grades assigned to commercial loans and loss rates for consumer loans. There are several other qualitative and quantitative factors considered in determining the ALLL. Periodically, reserve sensitivity analyses are performed. Such analyses provide insight into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and loss rates. Given the current processes used, we believe the risk grades and loss rates currently assigned are appropriate.Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carryover or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. At March 31, 2019, we had established reserves of $.3 billion for purchased impaired loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition.In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL.In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our ALLL.See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K and Note 3 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolios and establish the allowances.Table 23: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Dollars in millions 2019 2018 January 1 $2,629 $2,611 Total net charge-offs (136) (113) Provision for credit losses 189 92 Net decrease / (increase) in allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 6 7 Other 4 7 March 31 $2,692 $2,604 Net charge-offs to average loans (for the three months ended) (annualized) .24% .21% Ratio of ALLL to total loans 1.16% 1.18% Commercial lending net charge-offs $(12) $(10) Consumer lending net charge-offs (124) (103) Total net charge-offs $(136) $(113) Net charge-offs to average loans (for the three months ended) (annualized)     Commercial lending .03% .03% Consumer lending .68% .57% The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, net charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances.

Liquidity and Capital Management Liquidity risk, including our liquidity monitoring measures and tools, is described in further detail in the Liquidity and Capital Management section of our 2018 Form 10-K.One of the ways we monitor our liquidity is by reference to the LCR, a regulatory minimum liquidity requirement designed to ensure that covered banking organizations maintain an adequate level of liquidity to meet net liquidity needs over the course of a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario. The LCR is calculated by dividing the amount of an institution’s high quality, unencumbered liquid assets (HQLA), as defined and calculated in accordance with the LCR rules, by its estimated net cash outflows, with net cash outflows determined by applying the assumed outflow factors in the LCR rules. The resulting quotient is expressed as a percentage. The minimum LCR that PNC and PNC Bank are required to maintain is 100%. PNC and PNC Bank calculate the LCR daily, and as of March 31, 2019, the LCR for PNC and PNC Bank exceeded the requirement of 100%.We provide additional information regarding regulatory liquidity requirements and their potential impact on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2018 Form 10-K.Sources of LiquidityOur largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is the customer deposit base generated by our banking businesses. These deposits provide relatively stable and low-cost funding. Total deposits increased to $271.2 billion at March 31, 2019 from $267.8 billion at December 31, 2018 driven by growth in interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. See the Funding Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review for additional information related to our deposits. Additionally, certain assets determined by us to be liquid as well as unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to manage our liquidity position.At March 31, 2019, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $21.3 billion and securities available for sale totaling $65.1 billion. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet 26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Qmanagement activities. Our liquid assets included $1.6 billion of securities available for sale and trading securities pledged as collateral to secure public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements and for other purposes. In addition, $4.4 billion of securities held to maturity were also pledged as collateral for these purposes.We also obtain liquidity through various forms of funding, including long-term debt (senior notes, subordinated debt and FHLB borrowings) and short-term borrowings (securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings). See Note 10 Borrowed Funds in our 2018 Form 10-K and the Funding Sources section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review for additional information related to our borrowings.Total senior and subordinated debt, on a consolidated basis, increased due to the following activity:Table 25: Senior and Subordinated Debt In billions2019 January 1$30.9 Issuances2.1 Calls and maturities(1.8) Other.4 March 31$31.6 Bank LiquidityUnder PNC Bank’s 2014 bank note program, as amended, PNC Bank may from time to time offer up to $40.0 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes with maturity dates more than nine months (in the case of senior notes) and five years or more (in the case of subordinated notes) from their date of issue. At March 31, 2019, PNC Bank had $23.8 billion of notes outstanding under this program of which $19.6 billion were senior bank notes and $4.2 billion were subordinated bank notes. The following table details issuances for the three months ended March 31, 2019.Table 26: PNC Bank Notes IssuedIssuance DateAmountDescription of IssuanceMarch 12, 2019$1.1 billionFloating rate senior notes with a maturity date of March 12, 2021. Interest is payable at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of .35% on March 12, June 12, September 12 and December 12 of each year, beginning on June 12, 2019.PNC Bank maintains additional secured borrowing capacity with the FHLB-Pittsburgh and through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as a primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. At March 31, 2019, our unused secured borrowing capacity at the FHLB-Pittsburgh and the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $42.1 billion.PNC Bank has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of March 31, 2019, there were no issuances outstanding under this program.Parent Company LiquidityIn addition to managing liquidity risk at the bank level, we monitor the parent company’s liquidity. The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to our shareholders, share repurchases and acquisitions.As of March 31, 2019, available parent company liquidity totaled $5.2 billion. Parent company liquidity is primarily held in intercompany short-term investments, the terms of which provide for the availability of cash in 31 days or less. Investments with longer durations may also be acquired, but if so, the related maturities are aligned with scheduled cash needs, such as the maturity of parent company debt obligations.The principal source of parent company liquidity is the dividends it receives from PNC Bank, which may be impacted by the following:•Bank-level capital needs,•Laws and regulations,•Corporate policies,•Contractual restrictions, and•Other factors.27 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QThere are statutory and regulatory limitations on the ability of a national bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions or to extend credit to the parent company or its non-bank subsidiaries. The amount available for dividend payments by PNC Bank to the parent company without prior regulatory approval was approximately $2.7 billion at March 31, 2019. See Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these limitations.In addition to dividends from PNC Bank, other sources of parent company liquidity include cash and investments, as well as dividends and loan repayments from other subsidiaries and dividends or distributions from equity investments. We can also generate liquidity for the parent company and PNC’s non-bank subsidiaries through the issuance of debt and equity securities, including certain capital instruments, in public or private markets and commercial paper. The parent company has the ability to offer up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of March 31, 2019, there were no commercial paper issuances outstanding.The parent company has an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we can issue additional debt, equity and other capital instruments. Under this shelf registration statement, on January 23, 2019, the parent company issued $750 million in senior notes with a maturity date of January 23, 2024. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 3.50% per annum, on January 23 and July 23 of each year, beginning July 23, 2019. On February 15, 2019 the parent company issued an additional $300 million of these notes bringing the outstanding principal amount of the series to $1.05 billion. Parent company senior and subordinated debt outstanding totaled $7.8 billion and $6.7 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsWe have contractual obligations representing required future payments on borrowed funds, time deposits, leases, pension and postretirement benefits and purchase obligations. See the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2018 Form 10-K for more information on these future cash outflows. Additionally, in the normal course of business we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We provide information on our commitments in Note 13 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.Credit RatingsPNC’s credit ratings affect the cost and availability of short and long-term funding, collateral requirements for certain derivative instruments and the ability to offer certain products.In general, rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, level and quality of earnings, and the current legislative and regulatory environment, including implied government support. A decrease, or potential decrease, in credit ratings could impact access to the capital markets and/or increase the cost of debt, and thereby adversely affect liquidity and financial condition.Table 27: Credit Ratings for PNC and PNC Bank  March 31, 2019  Moody’sStandard & Poor’sFitchPNC   Senior debtA3A-A+Subordinated debtA3BBB+APreferred stockBaa2BBB-BBB-PNC Bank   Senior debtA2AA+Subordinated debtA3A-ALong-term depositsAa2AAA-Short-term depositsP-1A-1F1+Short-term notesP-1A-1F1Capital ManagementDetailed information on our capital management processes and activities, including additional information on our previous CCAR submissions and capital plans, is included in the Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section in our 2018 Form 10-K.We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing or redeeming debt, issuing equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions or repurchases, and managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QIn connection with the capital plan accepted by the Federal Reserve as part of our 2018 CCAR submission, we repurchased 5.9 million common shares for $725 million in the first quarter of 2019. As of March 31, 2019, PNC has repurchased a total of 15.3 million shares for $2.0 billion under current share repurchase programs that will end June 30, 2019. We paid dividends on common stock of $438 million, or $.95 per common share, during the first quarter of 2019. On April 4, 2019, the PNC Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $.95 per share with a payment date of May 5, 2019.Table 28: Basel III CapitalDollars in millionsBasel III March 31, 2019 Common equity Tier 1 capital  Common stock plus related surplus, net of treasury stock$4,810 Retained earnings39,742 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for securities currently, and those transferred from, available for sale419 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for pension and other postretirement plans(418) Goodwill, net of associated deferred tax liabilities(9,021) Other disallowed intangibles, net of deferred tax liabilities(239) Other adjustments/(deductions)(163) Total common equity Tier 1 capital before threshold deductions35,130 Total threshold deductions (3,074) Common equity Tier 1 capital$32,056 Additional Tier 1 capital  Preferred stock plus related surplus3,990 Other adjustments/(deductions)(157) Tier 1 capital$35,889 Additional Tier 2 capital  Qualifying subordinated debt3,731 Trust preferred capital securities60 Eligible credit reserves includable in Tier 2 capital2,971 Total Basel III capital$42,651 Risk-weighted assets  Basel III standardized approach risk-weighted assets (a)$328,128 Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets (b)$298,889 Average quarterly adjusted total assets$373,374 Supplementary leverage exposure (c)$448,129 Basel III risk-based capital and leverage ratios (d)  Common equity Tier 19.8% Tier 1 10.9% Total (e)13.0% Leverage (f)9.6% Supplementary leverage ratio (g)8.0% (a)Includes credit and market risk-weighted assets.(b)Basel III advanced approaches risk-weighted assets are calculated based on the Basel III advanced approaches rules, and include credit, market, and operational risk-weighted assets. During the parallel run qualification phase, PNC has refined the data, models, and internal processes used as part of the advanced approaches for determining risk-weighted assets.(c)Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures including undrawn credit commitments and derivative potential future exposures.(d)For comparative purposes only, the advanced approaches Basel III Common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based and Total risk-based ratios for March 31, 2019 were 10.7%, 12.0% and 13.3%, respectively.(e)The 2019 Basel III Total risk-based capital ratio includes nonqualifying trust preferred capital securities of $60 million that are subject to a phase-out period that runs through 2021. For comparative purposes only, as of March 31, 2019 the ratio was 13.0%, assuming nonqualifying trust preferred capital securities are phased out.(f)Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.(g)Supplementary leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Supplementary leverage exposure.Because PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2019 are calculated using the standardized approach for determining risk-weighted assets. Under the standardized approach for determining credit risk-weighted assets, exposures are generally assigned a pre-defined risk weight. Exposures to high volatility commercial real estate, past due exposures and equity exposures are generally subject to higher risk weights than other types of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29exposures. Once we exit parallel run, our regulatory risk-based capital ratios will be the lower of the ratios calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.Under the Basel III rules applicable to PNC, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions (for PNC, primarily BlackRock), mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital (net of associated deferred tax liabilities) to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institution's adjusted common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel III regulatory capital includes AOCI related to securities currently, and those transferred from, available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans. Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs), including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. BHCs, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our March 31, 2019 capital levels were aligned with them.At March 31, 2019, PNC and PNC Bank, our sole bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% for Total risk-based capital, and PNC Bank must have Basel III capital ratios of at least 6.5% for Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 10% for Total risk-based capital and a Leverage ratio of at least 5%.We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on us in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 18 Regulatory Matters in our 2018 Form 10-K. Market Risk ManagementSee the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management Section in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding market risk. Market Risk Management – Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk results primarily from our traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans. Many factors, including economic and financial conditions, movements in interest rates and consumer preferences, affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities and the level of our noninterest-bearing funding sources. Due to the repricing term mismatches and embedded options inherent in certain of these products, changes in market interest rates not only affect expected near-term earnings, but also the economic values of these assets and liabilities.The interest rates that we pay on customer deposits have risen in recent quarters as a result of higher short-term market interest rates. The rates paid on commercial deposits have had a higher correlation to increases in short-term interest rates, as compared to the rates paid on consumer deposits. During the remainder of 2019, we anticipate that the rates paid on our consumer deposits will continue to reflect any increases in short-term interest rates, although at a slower pace than previous years given the current Federal Reserve interest rate outlook. The rates paid on customer deposits are also impacted by factors including the level of interest rates, competition for deposits, new product offerings, changes in business strategies and customer migration to higher rate accounts.Our Asset and Liability Management group centrally manages interest rate risk as prescribed in our risk management policies, which are approved by management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QSensitivity results and market interest rate benchmarks for the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 follow.Table 29: Interest Sensitivity Analysis  First Quarter 2019 First Quarter 2018 Net Interest Income Sensitivity Simulation (a)    Effect on net interest income in first year from gradual interest rate change over the  following 12 months of:    100 basis point increase1.5 % 2.5 % 100 basis point decrease(2.2)% (3.1)% Effect on net interest income in second year from gradual interest rate change over the  preceding 12 months of:    100 basis point increase4.0 % 4.3 % 100 basis point decrease(6.6)% (7.0)% Duration of Equity Model (a)    Base case duration of equity (in years)(3.7) (.7) Key Period-End Interest Rates    One-month LIBOR2.49 % 1.88 % Three-month LIBOR2.60 % 2.31 % Three-year swap2.31 % 2.66 % (a)Given the inherent limitations in certain of these measurement tools and techniques, results become less meaningful as interest rates approach zero.In addition to measuring the effect on net interest income assuming parallel changes in current interest rates, we routinely simulate the effects of a number of nonparallel interest rate environments. Table 30 reflects the percentage change in net interest income over the next two 12-month periods assuming (i) the PNC Economist’s most likely rate forecast, (ii) implied market forward rates and (iii) yield curve slope flattening (a 100 basis point yield curve slope flattening between one-month and ten-year rates superimposed on current base rates) scenario.All changes in forecasted net interest income are relative to results in a base rate scenario where current market rates are assumed to remain unchanged over the forecast horizon.Table 30: Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Alternative Rate Scenarios March 31, 2019  PNCEconomistMarketForwardSlopeFlattening First year sensitivity.3%.3 %(.8)% Second year sensitivity1.4%(.3)%(3.7)% When forecasting net interest income, we make assumptions about interest rates and the shape of the yield curve, the volume and characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing on- and off-balance sheet positions. These assumptions determine the future level of simulated net interest income in the base interest rate scenario and the other interest rate scenarios presented in Tables 29 and 30. These simulations assume that as assets and liabilities mature, they are replaced or repriced at then current market rates.The following graph presents the LIBOR/Swap yield curves for the base rate scenario and each of the alternate scenarios one year forward.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 31Table 31: Alternate Interest Rate Scenarios: One Year ForwardThe first quarter 2019 interest sensitivity analyses indicate that our Consolidated Balance Sheet is positioned to benefit from an increase in interest rates and an upward sloping interest rate yield curve. We believe that we have the deposit funding base and balance sheet flexibility to adjust, where appropriate and permissible, to changing interest rates and market conditions.Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading RiskWe engage in fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support our customers’ investing and hedging activities. These transactions, related hedges and the credit valuation adjustment related to our customer derivatives portfolio are marked-to-market daily and reported as customer-related trading activities. We do not engage in proprietary trading of these products.We use value-at-risk (VaR) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities. VaR is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors. A diversified VaR reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes. We calculate a diversified VaR at a 95% confidence interval and the results for the first three months of 2019 and 2018 were within our acceptable limits.See the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk section of our 2018 Form 10-K for more information on our models used to calculate VaR and our backtesting process.Customer related trading revenue was $48 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $77 million for the first quarter in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in credit valuations for customer-related derivative activities and lower foreign exchange and derivative client sales revenue. Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment RiskEquity investment risk is the risk of potential losses associated with investing in both private and public equity markets. In addition to extending credit, taking deposits, underwriting securities and trading financial instruments, we make and manage direct investments in a variety of transactions, including management buyouts, recapitalizations and growth financings in a variety of industries. We also have investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds that make similar investments in private equity. The economic and/or book value of these investments and other assets are directly affected by changes in market factors.Various PNC business units manage our equity and other investment activities. Our businesses are responsible for making investment decisions within the approved policy limits and associated guidelines.A summary of our equity investments follows:Table 32: Equity Investments Summary  March 312019 December 312018 Change Dollars in millions $ % BlackRock$8,080 $8,016 $64 1 % Tax credit investments2,057 2,219 (162) (7)% Private equity and other2,430 2,659 (229) (9)% Total$12,567 $12,894 $(327) (3)% BlackRockWe owned approximately 35 million common stock equivalent shares of BlackRock equity at March 31, 2019, accounted for under the equity method. The Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review includes additional information about BlackRock.32 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTax Credit InvestmentsIncluded in our equity investments are direct tax credit investments and equity investments held by consolidated entities. These tax credit investment balances included unfunded commitments totaling $.7 billion and $.8 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. These unfunded commitments are included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Form 10-K has further information on Tax Credit Investments.Private Equity and OtherThe majority of our other equity investments consists of our private equity portfolio. The private equity portfolio is an illiquid portfolio consisting of mezzanine and equity investments that vary by industry, stage and type of investment. Private equity investments carried at estimated fair value totaled $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. As of March 31, 2019, $1.2 billion was invested directly in a variety of companies and $.2 billion was invested indirectly through various private equity funds. See the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 of our 2018 Form 10-K for discussion of the potential impacts of the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank on our interests in and of private funds covered by the Volcker Rule.Included in our other equity investments are Visa Class B common shares, which are recorded at cost. Visa Class B common shares that we own are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into shares of the publicly-traded Class A common shares, which cannot happen until the resolution of the pending interchange litigation. Based upon the March 31, 2019 per share closing price of $156.19 for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of our total investment in the Class B common shares was approximately $895 million at the current conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares, while our cost basis was not significant. See Note 6 Fair Value and Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2018 10-K for additional information regarding our Visa agreements. The estimated value does not represent fair value of the Visa B common shares given the share’s limited transferability and the lack of observable transactions in the marketplace.We also have certain other equity investments, the majority of which represent investments in affiliated and non-affiliated funds with both traditional and alternative investment strategies. Net gains related to these investments were not significant at March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.Financial DerivativesWe use a variety of financial derivatives as part of the overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities.Financial derivatives involve, to varying degrees, market and credit risk. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional and an underlying as specified in the contract. Therefore, cash requirements and exposure to credit risk are significantly less than the notional amount on these instruments.Further information on our financial derivatives is presented in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 6 Fair Value in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Form 10-K and in Note 6 Fair Value and Note 9 Financial Derivatives in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report.Not all elements of market and credit risk are addressed through the use of financial derivatives, and such instruments may be ineffective for their intended purposes due to unanticipated market changes, among other reasons.RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS On March 6, 2019, the Federal Reserve released a final rule amending its capital plan rule. Under the final rule, the capital plan that PNC files in connection with the annual CCAR exercise, including the capital plan submitted on April 5, 2019 in connection with the 2019 CCAR exercise, is no longer subject to a potential objection by the Federal Reserve based on qualitative factors.In a separate action on the same date, the Federal Reserve also affirmed a countercyclical capital buffer of 0% applicable under its regulatory capital rules to PNC and other BHCs with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or more than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposure. For more information on the capital plan rule, the CCAR exercise and the countercyclical capital buffer see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2018 Form 10-K.On March 29, 2019, the FDIC released two proposals for public comment that would amend its (i) enhanced deposit insurance recordkeeping requirements for insured depository institutions (IDIs) with at least 2 million deposit accounts, including PNC Bank, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33and (ii) deposit insurance recordkeeping requirements for joint deposit accounts applicable to all IDIs. Among other things, the proposals would revise the attestation requirement under the deposit insurance recordkeeping rules and allow covered IDIs to elect to extend the April 1, 2020 compliance date for the deposit insurance recordkeeping requirements by up to one year.In April, the Federal Reserve and FDIC requested public comment on proposed rules that would tailor the resolution plan requirements for BHCs with at least $100 billion in total consolidated assets under Sec. 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Under the proposal, PNC generally would be required to submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and FDIC on a triennial cycle, with the scope of the submissions alternating between a full and a targeted submission from one triennial cycle to the next. The agencies, however, could jointly adjust the timeline for submissions or request interim updates between filings. As proposed, these changes would become effective no later than November 24, 2019 and, once effective, PNC’s first full resolution plan submission under the proposal would be due July 1, 2021.On April 16, 2019, the FDIC requested comment on an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that would alter the FDIC’s separate resolution plan requirements for IDIs with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion (covered IDIs), including PNC Bank. Under the proposal, covered IDIs would potentially be grouped into three categories. The proposal requests comment on what metrics or characteristics could be used to classify covered IDIs into these groups. The proposal would also potentially change the content and submission requirements of resolution plans for some of the groups. The proposal also would delay the requirement for PNC Bank (as well as other covered IDIs) to file a resolution plan under the FDIC’s current rules until a future date to be specified by the FDIC. For more information on the resolution planning requirements applicable to PNC and PNC Bank see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2018 Form 10-K.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTSNote 1 Accounting Policies of our 2018 Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may vary under different assumptions or conditions and such variations may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.The following critical accounting policies and judgments are described in more detail in Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in Item 7 of our 2018 Form 10-K:•Fair Value Measurements•Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit•Residential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QRecently Issued Accounting StandardsAccounting Standards Update (ASU)DescriptionFinancial Statement ImpactCredit Losses - ASU 2016-13Issued June 2016• Required effective date of January 1, 2020.(a) • Requires the use of an expected credit loss methodology; specifically, current expected credit losses (CECL) for the remaining life of the asset will be recognized at the time of origination or acquisition. • Methodology will apply to loans, debt securities, and other financial assets and net investment in leases not accounted for at fair value through net income. It will also apply to off-balance sheet credit exposures except for unconditionally cancellable commitments. • In-scope assets will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected after deducting the allowance for credit losses from the amortized cost basis of the assets. • Requires enhanced credit quality disclosures including disaggregation of credit quality indicators by vintage. • Requires a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. • We did not adopt the standard at its early adoption date of January 2019.• We established a company-wide, cross-functional governance structure in the third quarter of 2016, which oversees overall strategy for implementation of CECL. • We have prepared preliminary CECL accounting policies and interpretations, and continue to refine and test our models, estimation techniques, data, operational processes and controls to be used in preparing the CECL estimates.• We expect that we will be able to test-run our key processes by the end of the second quarter of 2019, pending any unforeseen circumstances or significant changes to the requirements. During 2019, we expect to continually address any gaps in our interpretations, methodology, data and operational processes based upon our reviews and tests. • We are also participating in the FASB’s standard setting activity related to CECL. The FASB has issued a proposed ASU for technical corrections related to financial instruments, which has an impact on the implementation of CECL related to treatment of recoveries, accrued interest receivables and some disclosure requirements. We are awaiting final guidance from the FASB, and expect to be able to implement any changes.• We believe that given current conditions, our credit loss reserves will increase primarily for longer duration consumer loans, due to the difference between loss emergence periods currently used versus the remaining life of the asset required under CECL. We will continue to refine our estimates throughout 2019, as CECL models and techniques are implemented and the results are vetted. We continue to believe that total credit loss reserves will increase at the adoption date and that the magnitude of the increase will depend upon the nature and characteristics of the portfolio at the adoption date, as well as macroeconomic conditions and forecasts at that date. Goodwill - ASU 2017-04Issued January 2017• Required effective date of January 1, 2020.(a)• Eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill under which a loss was recognized only if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is below its carrying value.• Requires impairment to be recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.• We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date and we do not expect the adoption of this standard to impact our consolidated results of operations or our consolidated financial position.(a) Early adoption is permitted.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsSee Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report regarding the impact of new accounting pronouncements. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESWe engage in a variety of activities that involve entities that are not consolidated or otherwise reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. Additional information on these types of activities is included in our 2018 Form 10-K and in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities and Note 13 Commitments in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.A summary and further description of variable interest entities (VIEs) is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2018 Form 10-K.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 35Trust Preferred SecuritiesSee Note 10 Borrowed Funds in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on trust preferred securities issued by PNC Capital Trust C including information on contractual limitations potentially imposed on payments (including dividends) with respect to PNC's equity securities. INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESAs of March 31, 2019, we performed an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and of changes in our internal control over financial reporting.Based on that evaluation, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) were effective as of March 31, 2019, and that there has been no change in PNC’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first quarter of 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.GLOSSARY OF TERMSFor a glossary of terms commonly used in our filings, please see the glossary of terms included in our 2018 Form 10-K. CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATIONWe make statements in this Report, and we may from time to time make other statements, regarding our outlook for earnings, revenues, expenses, tax rates, capital and liquidity levels and ratios, asset levels, asset quality, financial position, and other matters regarding or affecting us and our future business and operations that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “see,” “look,” “intend,” “outlook,” “project,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “goal,” “will,” “should” and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We do not assume any duty to update forward-looking statements. Actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in forward-looking statements, as well as from historical performance.Our forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties.•Our businesses, financial results and balance sheet values are affected by business and economic conditions, including the following:–Changes in interest rates and valuations in debt, equity and other financial markets.–Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets.–Actions by the Federal Reserve Board, U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, including those that impact money supply and market interest rates.–Changes in customer behavior due to recently enacted tax legislation, changing business and economic conditions or legislative or regulatory initiatives.–Changes in customers’, suppliers’ and other counterparties’ performance and creditworthiness.–Impact of tariffs and other trade policies of the U.S. and its global trading partners.–Slowing or reversal of the current U.S. economic expansion.–Commodity price volatility.•Our forward-looking financial statements are subject to the risk that economic and financial market conditions will be substantially different than those we are currently expecting and do not take into account potential legal and regulatory contingencies. These statements are based on our views that:–U.S. economic growth has accelerated over the past two years to above its long-run trend.–Growth is expected to rebound in the second quarter following a soft first quarter 2019, and slow over the remaining course of 2019 and into 2020.–Further gradual improvement in the labor market will occur this year, including job gains and rising wages, which would be a positive indicator for consumer spending. –Trade restrictions and geopolitical concerns are downside risks to the forecast.–Inflation has slowed in early 2019, to below the FOMC’s 2% objective, but is expected to rise in the second half of the year.–Our baseline forecast is for no change to the federal funds rate in 2019 and 2020, with the rate staying in its current range of 2.25 to 2.50%.36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q•Our ability to take certain capital actions, including returning capital to shareholders, is subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board as part of our comprehensive capital plan for the applicable period in connection with the Federal Reserve Board’s CCAR process and to the acceptance of such capital plan and non-objection to such capital actions by the Federal Reserve Board.•Our regulatory capital ratios in the future will depend on, among other things, the company’s financial performance, the scope and terms of final capital regulations then in effect and management actions affecting the composition of our balance sheet. In addition, our ability to determine, evaluate and forecast regulatory capital ratios, and to take actions (such as capital distributions) based on actual or forecasted capital ratios, will be dependent at least in part on the development, validation and regulatory approval of related models.•Legal and regulatory developments could have an impact on our ability to operate our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, or pursuit of attractive acquisition opportunities. Reputational impacts could affect matters such as business generation and retention, liquidity, funding, and ability to attract and retain management. These developments could include:–Changes resulting from legislative and regulatory reforms, including changes affecting oversight of the financial services industry, consumer protection, pension, bankruptcy and other industry aspects, and changes in accounting policies and principles.–Changes to regulations governing bank capital and liquidity standards.–Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries. These matters may result in monetary judgments or settlements or other remedies, including fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs, and may cause reputational harm to us.–Results of the regulatory examination and supervision process, including our failure to satisfy requirements of agreements with governmental agencies.–Impact on business and operating results of any costs associated with obtaining rights in intellectual property claimed by others and of adequacy of our intellectual property protection in general.•Business and operating results are affected by our ability to identify and effectively manage risks inherent in our businesses, including, where appropriate, through effective use of systems and controls, third-party insurance, derivatives, and capital management techniques, and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards.•Business and operating results also include impacts relating to our equity interest in BlackRock, Inc. and rely to a significant extent on information provided to us by BlackRock. Risks and uncertainties that could affect BlackRock are discussed in more detail by BlackRock in its SEC filings.•We grow our business in part through acquisitions and new strategic initiatives. Risks and uncertainties include those presented by the nature of the business acquired and strategic initiative, including in some cases those associated with our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets and risks resulting from our inexperience in those new areas, as well as risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition transactions themselves, regulatory issues, and the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.•Competition can have an impact on customer acquisition, growth and retention and on credit spreads and product pricing, which can affect market share, deposits and revenues. Our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes can also impact our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands.•Business and operating results can also be affected by widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, terrorist activities, system failures, security breaches, cyberattacks or international hostilities through impacts on the economy and financial markets generally or on us or our counterparties specifically.We provide greater detail regarding these as well as other factors in our 2018 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Report, including in the Risk Factors and Risk Management sections and the Legal Proceedings and Commitments Notes of the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in these reports.

(PNC) is one of the largest diversified financial services companies in the United States and is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.We have businesses engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of our products and services nationally. Our retail branch network is located in markets across the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. We also have strategic international offices in four countries outside the U.S. NOTE 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of Financial Statement PresentationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its subsidiaries, most of which are wholly-owned, certain partnership interests and variable interest entities.We prepared these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions. We have also reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current period presentation, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal, recurring adjustments needed to present fairly our results for the interim periods. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period.We have also considered the impact of subsequent events on these consolidated financial statements.When preparing these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, we have assumed that you have read the audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Form 10-K. Reference is made to Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for a detailed description of significant accounting policies. There have been no significant changes to our accounting policies as disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K, except for the adoption of the new leasing standard included in this Note 1 in the first quarter of 2019. These interim consolidated financial statements serve to update our 2018 Form 10-K and may not include all information and Notes necessary to constitute a complete set of financial statements.Use of EstimatesWe prepared these consolidated financial statements using financial information available at the time of preparation, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Our most significant estimates pertain to our fair value measurements and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Actual results may differ from the estimates and the differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements.LeasesWe provide financing for various types of equipment, including aircraft, energy and power systems, and vehicles through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments plus estimated residual value of the leased equipment, less unearned income. We recognize income over the term of the lease using the constant effective yield method. Direct financing lease residual values are reviewed for impairment in accordance with the Allowance for Loan and Lease (ALLL) processes. Gains or losses on the sale of leased assets are included in Other noninterest income while impairment on the net investment of leases is included in Provision for credit losses.We also enter into various lease arrangements, primarily involving real estate, and other equipment, as the lessee. For those classified as operating leases, we recognize a lease liability, representing the present value of the minimum lease payments, and a corresponding right of use (ROU) asset. On the consolidated balance sheet, the ROU asset and lease liability are included in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively. The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 43When we adopted the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02 - Leases as of January 1, 2019, we recognized lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. In addition, we recognized a one-time pretax adjustment of $83 million to retained earnings, related primarily to deferred gains on previous sale-leaseback transactions. See Note 16 Leases for additional information related to leases within the scope of ASC 842.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsAccounting Standards Update (ASU)DescriptionFinancial Statement ImpactLeasesASU 2016-02Issued February 2016• Requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and related lease liability for all leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. • Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. • Targeted changes have been made to the lessor accounting model to align the guidance with the new lessee model and revenue recognition guidance. • May be adopted using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment.• Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an ASU which permits the option to adopt the new standard prospectively as of the effective date, without adjusting comparative periods presented. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the effective date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. • We adopted this standard under the modified retrospective approach as of January 1, 2019, without adjusting comparative periods presented. We recognized lease liabilities and right-of-use assets of $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion respectively, as of January 1, 2019. We recognized a one-time pretax adjustment of $83 million to retained earnings, related primarily to deferred gains on previous sale-leaseback transactions. • The impact of adoption was immaterial to PNC’s consolidated income statement.• The impact of adoption of the changes to the lessor accounting model did not have a material impact on our financial statements. NOTE 2 LOAN SALE AND SERVICING ACTIVITIES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESLoan Sale and Servicing ActivitiesAs more fully described in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2018 Form 10-K, we have transferred residential and commercial mortgage loans in securitization or sales transactions in which we have continuing involvement. Our continuing involvement generally consists of servicing, repurchasing previously transferred loans under certain conditions and loss share arrangements, and, in limited circumstances, holding of mortgage-backed securities issued by the securitization special purpose entities (SPEs).We earn servicing and other ancillary fees for our role as servicer and, depending on the contractual terms of the servicing arrangement, we can be terminated as servicer with or without cause. At the consummation date of each type of loan transfer where we retain the servicing, we recognize a servicing right at fair value. See Note 6 Fair Value and Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights for information on our servicing rights, including the carrying value of servicing assets.44 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QThe following table provides cash flows associated with our loan sale and servicing activities: Table 33: Cash Flows Associated with Loan Sale and Servicing Activities In millionsResidentialMortgages CommercialMortgages (a)  Cash Flows - Three months ended March 31, 2019     Sales of loans (b)$715  $644 Repurchases of previously transferred loans (c)$93   Servicing fees (d)$87  $30 Servicing advances recovered/(funded), net$18  $(23) Cash flows on mortgage-backed securities held (e)$507  $14 Cash Flows - Three months ended March 31, 2018     Sales of loans (b)$1,193  $1,202 Repurchases of previously transferred loans (c)$119   Servicing fees (d)$92  $31 Servicing advances recovered/(funded), net$4  $17 Cash flows on mortgage-backed securities held (e)$422  $21 (a)Represents cash flow information associated with both commercial mortgage loan transfers and servicing activities.(b)Gains/losses recognized on sales of loans were insignificant for the periods presented.(c)Includes both residential and commercial mortgage government insured or guaranteed loans eligible for repurchase through the exercise of our removal of account provision option, as well as residential mortgage loans repurchased due to alleged breaches of origination covenants or representations and warranties made to purchasers.(d)Includes contractually specified servicing fees, late charges and ancillary fees.(e)Represents cash flows on securities where we transferred to and/or service loans for a securitization SPE and we hold securities issued by that SPE. The carrying values of such securities held were $14.6 billion, $13.3 billion, and $9.4 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities and $.6 billion, $.6 billion, and $.7 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities at March 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2018, respectively. Table 34 presents information about the principal balances of transferred loans that we service and are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We would only experience a loss on these transferred loans if we were required to repurchase a loan, where the repurchase price exceeded the loan's fair value, due to a breach in representations and warranties or a loss sharing arrangement associated with our continuing involvement with these loans. The estimate of losses related to breaches in representations and warranties was insignificant at March 31, 2019.Table 34: Principal Balance, Delinquent Loans and Net Charge-offs Related to Serviced Loans For Others In millionsResidential Mortgages  Commercial Mortgages (a) March 31, 2019     Total principal balance$53,055  $46,767 Delinquent loans (b)$599  $131 December 31, 2018     Total principal balance$54,028  $47,969 Delinquent loans (b)$622  $234 Three months ended March 31, 2019     Net charge-offs (c)$11  $119 Three months ended March 31, 2018     Net charge-offs (c)$12  $30 (a)Represents information at the securitization level in which we have sold loans and we are the servicer for the securitization.(b)Serviced delinquent loans are 90 days or more past due or are in process of foreclosure.(c)Net charge-offs for Residential mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported to investors during the period. Net charge-offs for Commercial mortgages represent credit losses less recoveries distributed and as reported by the trustee for commercial mortgage backed securitizations. Realized losses for Agency securitizations are not reflected as we do not manage the underlying real estate upon foreclosure and, as such, do not have access to loss information.Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in our 2018 Form 10-K, we are involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be VIEs.The following table provides a summary of non-consolidated VIEs with which we have significant continuing involvement but are not the primary beneficiary. We have excluded certain transactions with non-consolidated VIEs from the balances presented in Table 35 where we have determined that our continuing involvement is not significant. We do not consider our continuing involvement to be significant when it relates to a VIE where we only invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or where no transfers have occurred between us and the VIE. In addition, where we only have lending arrangements in the normal The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 45course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these transactions with non-consolidated entities from the balances presented in Table 35. These loans are included as part of the asset quality disclosures that we make in Note 3 Asset Quality.Table 35: Non-Consolidated VIEs In millionsPNC Risk of Loss (a)  Carrying Value of AssetsOwned by PNC   Carrying Value of LiabilitiesOwned by PNC March 31, 2019         Mortgage-backed securitizations (b)$15,551  $15,551(c)     Tax credit investments and other2,854  2,826(d)   $763(e) Total$18,405  $18,377   $763 December 31, 2018         Mortgage-backed securitizations (b)$14,266  $14,266(c)    Tax credit investments and other2,949  2,911(d)   $806(e) Total$17,215  $17,177   $806 (a)Represents loans, investments and other assets related to non-consolidated VIEs, net of collateral (if applicable).

The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital and to assist us in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we recognized $55 million of amortization, $57 million of tax credits and $13 million of other tax benefits associated with qualified investments in low income housing tax credits within Income taxes.NOTE 3 ASSET QUALITYWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates may be a key indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the loan portfolios. The measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases, OREO and foreclosed assets. Nonperforming loans are those loans accounted for at amortized cost whose credit quality has deteriorated to the extent that full collection of contractual principal and interest is not probable. Interest income is not recognized on these loans. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are reported as performing loans as these loans are accounted for at fair value. However, when nonaccrual criteria is met, interest income is not recognized on these loans. Additionally, certain government insured or guaranteed loans for which we expect to collect substantially all principal and interest are not reported as nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest. Purchased impaired loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information on our loan related policies. 46 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QThe following tables present the delinquency status of our loans and our nonperforming assets at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.Table 36: Analysis of Loan Portfolio (a) Accruing      Dollars in millionsCurrent or LessThan 30 DaysPast Due30-59 DaysPast Due60-89 DaysPast Due90 DaysOr MorePast DueTotal PastDue (b) NonperformingLoansFair ValueOptionNonaccrualLoans (c)PurchasedImpairedLoansTotalLoans (d) March 31, 2019           Commercial Lending           Commercial$122,448$80$25$71$176 $369  $122,993 Commercial real estate28,003431 44 54  28,101 Equipment lease financing7,252845 89 7  7,348 Total commercial lending157,7032073171309 430 158,442 Consumer Lending          Home equity24,011592180 763 $64625,500 Residential real estate16,74315362323538(b)339$1841,30319,107 Automobile14,467972610133 107  14,707 Credit card6,134452853126 7  6,267 Education3,4806338126227(b)    3,707 Other consumer4,533106723 7  4,563 Total consumer lending69,3684271815191,127 1,2231841,94973,851 Total$227,071$634$212$590$1,436 $1,653$184$1,949$232,293 Percentage of total loans97.75%.27%.09%.25%.62% .71%.08%.84%100.00% December 31, 2018           Commercial Lending           Commercial$116,300$82$54$52$188 $346  $116,834 Commercial real estate28,05663 9 75  28,140 Equipment lease financing7,2295612 68 11  7,308 Total commercial lending151,5851446952265 432  152,282 Consumer Lending           Home equity24,556662591 797 $67926,123 Residential real estate16,21613573363571(b) 350$1821,33818,657 Automobile14,1651132912154 100  14,419 Credit card6,222462953128 7  6,357 Education3,5716941141251(b)   3,822 Other consumer4,552125825 8  4,585 Total consumer lending69,2824412025771,220 1,2621822,01773,963 Total$220,867$585$271$629$1,485 $1,694$182$2,017$226,245 Percentage of total loans97.62%.26%.12%.28%.66% .75%.08%.89%100.00% (a)Amounts in table represent recorded investment and exclude loans held for sale.

The comparable amounts at December 31, 2018 were $17.3 billion and $63.2 billion, respectively.

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, these loans are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). See Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K and the TDR section of this Note 3 for additional information on TDRs.Total nonperforming loans in Table 37 include TDRs of $.9 billion at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. TDRs that are performing, including consumer credit card TDR loans, totaled $1.0 billion at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, and are excluded from nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are returned to accrual status and classified as performing after demonstrating a period of at least six months of consecutive performance under the restructured terms. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to us and loans to borrowers not currently obligated to make both principal and interest payments under the restructured terms are not returned to accrual status. Additional Asset Quality IndicatorsWe have two portfolio segments – Commercial Lending and Consumer Lending. Each of these segments comprises multiple loan classes. Classes are characterized by similarities in initial measurement, risk attributes and the manner in which we monitor and assess credit risk. The Commercial Lending segment is composed of the commercial, commercial real estate and equipment lease financing loan classes. The Consumer Lending segment is composed of the home equity, residential real estate, automobile, credit card, education and other consumer loan classes.Commercial Lending Loan ClassesThe following table presents asset quality indicators for the Commercial Lending loan classes. See Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information related to our Commercial Lending loan classes, including discussion around the asset quality indicators that we use to monitor and manage the credit risk associated with each loan class.Table 38: Commercial Lending Asset Quality Indicators (a)In millions Pass Rated Criticized Total Loans March 31, 2019       Commercial $117,366 $5,627 $122,993 Commercial real estate 27,251 850 28,101 Equipment lease financing 7,206 142 7,348 Total commercial lending $151,823 $6,619 $158,442 December 31, 2018       Commercial $111,276 $5,558 $116,834 Commercial real estate 27,682 458 28,140 Equipment lease financing 7,180 128 7,308 Total commercial lending $146,138 $6,144 $152,282 (a)Loans are classified as Pass and Criticized based on the Regulatory Classification definitions. The Criticized classification includes loans that were rated Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. We use probability of default and loss given default to rate loans in the commercial lending portfolio. 48 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QConsumer Lending Loan ClassesSee Note 3 Asset Quality in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional information related to our Consumer Lending loan classes, including discussion around the asset quality indicators that we use to monitor and manage the credit risk associated with each loan class.Home Equity and Residential Real Estate Loan ClassesThe following table presents asset quality indicators for the home equity and residential real estate loan classes.

The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 49Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)Table 41 quantifies the number of loans that were classified as TDRs, as well as the change in the loans’ recorded investment as a result of becoming a TDR during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. Additionally, the table provides information about the types of TDR concessions.

We consider a TDR to have subsequently defaulted when it becomes 60 days past due after the most recent date the loan was restructured. The recorded investment of loans that were both (i) classified as TDRs or were subsequently modified during each 12-month period preceding January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2018, respectively, and (ii) subsequently defaulted during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018 totaled $18 million and $21 million, respectively. Impaired LoansImpaired loans include commercial and consumer nonperforming loans and TDRs, regardless of nonperforming status. TDRs that were previously recorded at amortized cost and are now classified and accounted for as held for sale are also included. Excluded from impaired loans are nonperforming leases, loans accounted for as held for sale other than the TDRs described in the preceding sentence, loans accounted for under the fair value option, smaller balance homogeneous type loans and purchased impaired loans. We did not recognize any interest income on impaired loans that have not returned to performing status, while they were impaired during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018. Table 42 provides further detail on impaired loans individually evaluated for impairment and the associated ALLL. Certain commercial and consumer impaired loans do not have a related ALLL as the valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the recorded investment.Table 42: Impaired LoansIn millions UnpaidPrincipal Balance RecordedInvestment AssociatedAllowance Average RecordedInvestment (a) March 31, 2019         Impaired loans with an associated allowance         Total commercial lending $481 $383 $87 $349 Total consumer lending 855 808 130 813 Total impaired loans with an associated allowance 1,336 1,191 217 1,162 Impaired loans without an associated allowance         Total commercial lending 358 263   295 Total consumer lending 1,014 604   614 Total impaired loans without an associated allowance 1,372 867  909 Total impaired loans $2,708 $2,058 $217 $2,071 December 31, 2018         Impaired loans with an associated allowance         Total commercial lending $440 $315 $73 $349 Total consumer lending 863 817 136 904 Total impaired loans with an associated allowance 1,303 1,132 209 1,253 Impaired loans without an associated allowance         Total commercial lending 413 326   294 Total consumer lending 1,042 625   645 Total impaired loans without an associated allowance 1,455 951   939 Total impaired loans $2,758 $2,083 $209 $2,192 (a)Average recorded investment is for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.50 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QNOTE 4 ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES We maintain the ALLL at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the portfolios as of the balance sheet date.

Net unrealized gains and losses in the securities available for sale portfolio are included in Shareholders’ equity as AOCI, unless credit-related. Securities held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Investment securities at March 31, 2019 included $623 million of net unsettled purchases which represent non-cash investing activity, and accordingly, are not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. At March 31, 2019, AOCI included pretax gains of $25 million from derivatives that hedged the purchase of investment securities classified as held to maturity. The gains will be accreted into interest income as an adjustment of yield on the securities.Table 45 presents gross unrealized losses and fair value of debt securities at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The securities are segregated between investments that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and twelve months or more based on the point in time that the fair value declined below the amortized cost basis.

For those securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2019, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represented OTTI, we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.1 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities.The majority of these cumulative impairment charges related to non-agency residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities rated BB or lower. During the first three months of 2019 and 2018, the OTTI credit losses recognized in noninterest income and the OTTI noncredit losses recognized in AOCI on securities were not significant.Information relating to gross realized securities gains and losses from the sales of securities is set forth in the following table:Table 46: Gains (Losses) on Sales of Securities Available for SaleThree months ended March 31In millionsGross GainsGross LossesNet Gains (Losses) Tax Expense  2019$27$(14)$13$3 2018$37$(38)$(1) The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 53The following table presents, by remaining contractual maturity, the amortized cost, fair value and weighted-average yield of debt securities at March 31, 2019.Table 47: Contractual Maturity of SecuritiesMarch 31, 2019Dollars in millions 1 Year or Less After 1 Yearthrough 5 Years After 5 Yearsthrough 10 Years After 10Years Total Securities Available for Sale           U.S. Treasury and government agencies $679 $13,599 $3,795 $785 $18,858 Residential mortgage-backed           Agency 2 52 867 28,628 29,549 Non-agency       1,834 1,834 Commercial mortgage-backed           Agency   590 309 1,699 2,598 Non-agency     332 2,499 2,831 Asset-backed 31 2,529 1,616 1,332 5,508 Other  476 1,522 475 873 3,346 Total securities available for sale $1,188 $18,292 $7,394 $37,650 $64,524 Fair value $1,188 $18,294 $7,484 $38,085 $65,051 Weighted-average yield, GAAP basis 2.58% 2.29% 2.98% 3.25% 2.93% Securities Held to Maturity           U.S. Treasury and government agencies     $490 $273 $763 Residential mortgage-backed           Agency   $78 523 14,716 15,317 Non-agency       149 149 Commercial mortgage-backed           Agency $11 42 4 50 107 Non-agency       473 473 Asset-backed   7 100 67 174 Other 23 621 749 442 1,835 Total securities held to maturity $34 $748 $1,866 $16,170 $18,818 Fair value $34 $768 $1,928 $16,078 $18,808 Weighted-average yield, GAAP basis 4.87% 3.84% 3.45% 3.27% 3.31% Weighted-average yields are based on amortized cost with effective yields weighted for the contractual maturity of each security.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date, determined using an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The fair value hierarchy established by GAAP requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 6 Fair Value in our 2018 Form 10-K.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFor more information on the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, see Note 6 Fair Value in our 2018 Form 10-K.

MSRs totaled $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and consisted of loan servicing contracts for commercial and residential mortgages measured at fair value.MSRs are subject to declines in value from actual or expected prepayment of the underlying loans and defaults as well as market driven changes in interest rates. We manage this risk by economically hedging the fair value of MSRs with securities and derivative instruments which are expected to increase (or decrease) in value when the value of MSRs decreases (or increases).See the Sensitivity Analysis section of this Note 7, as well as Note 6 Fair Value in our 2018 Form 10-K for more detail on our fair value measurement of MSRs. Refer to Note 7 Goodwill and Mortgage Servicing Rights in our 2018 Form 10-K for more information on our accounting and measurement of MSRs.Changes in the commercial and residential MSRs follow:Table 56: Mortgage Servicing Rights Commercial MSRs Residential MSRs In millions20192018 20192018 January 1$726$668 $1,257$1,164 Additions:      From loans sold with servicing retained717 713 Purchases1923 69 Changes in fair value due to:      Time and payoffs (a)(38)(33) (33)(37) Other (b)(33)48 (106)107 March 31$681$723 $1,131$1,256 Related unpaid principal balance at March 31$186,946$169,172 $123,079$124,696 Servicing advances at March 31$243$200 $138$197 (a)Represents decrease in MSR value due to passage of time, including the impact from both regularly scheduled loan principal payments and loans that were paid down or paid off during the period.(b)Represents MSR value changes resulting primarily from market-driven changes in interest rates.Sensitivity AnalysisThe fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and significant inputs to the valuation models as of March 31, 2019 are shown in Tables 57 and 58. The expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are significant factors driving the fair value. Management uses both internal proprietary models and a third-party model to estimate future commercial mortgage loan prepayments and a third-party model to estimate future residential mortgage loan prepayments. These models have been refined based on current market conditions and management judgment. Future interest rates are another important factor in the valuation of MSRs. Management utilizes market implied forward interest rates to estimate the future direction of mortgage and discount rates. The forward rates utilized are derived from the current yield curve for U.S. dollar interest rate swaps and are consistent with pricing of capital markets instruments. Changes in the shape and slope of the forward curve in future periods may result in volatility in the fair value estimate.A sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to adverse changes in key assumptions is presented in Tables 57 and 58. These sensitivities do not include the impact of the related hedging activities. Changes in fair value generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (e.g., changes in mortgage interest rates, which drive changes in prepayment rate estimates, could result in changes in the interest rate spread), which could either magnify or counteract the sensitivities.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 62The following tables set forth the fair value of commercial and residential MSRs and the sensitivity analysis of the hypothetical effect on the fair value of MSRs to immediate adverse changes of 10% and 20% in those assumptions.Table 57: Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights – Key Valuation AssumptionsDollars in millionsMarch 312019 December 312018 Fair value$681 $726 Weighted-average life (years)4.1 4.1 Weighted-average constant prepayment rate5.45% 5.65% Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change$10 $10 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change$19 $19 Effective discount rate8.23% 8.39% Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change$18 $19 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change$36 $39 Table 58: Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights – Key Valuation AssumptionsDollars in millionsMarch 312019 December 312018 Fair value$1,131 $1,257 Weighted-average life (years)6.2 6.9 Weighted-average constant prepayment rate10.46% 8.69% Decline in fair value from 10% adverse change$43 $41 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change$83 $79 Weighted-average option adjusted spread805bps806bpsDecline in fair value from 10% adverse change$32 $37 Decline in fair value from 20% adverse change$63 $73 Fees from mortgage loan servicing, which includes contractually specified servicing fees, late fees and ancillary fees were $.1 billion for both the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. We also generate servicing fees from fee-based activities provided to others for which we do not have an associated servicing asset. Fees from commercial and residential MSRs are reported within Noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement in Corporate services and Residential mortgage, respectively.NOTE 8 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSPension and Postretirement PlansAs described in Note 11 Employee Benefit Plans in our 2018 Form 10-K, we have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are a percentage of eligible compensation and are subject to a minimum annual amount. Any pension contributions to the plan are based on an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund total benefits payable to plan participants.We also maintain nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees and provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees (postretirement benefits) through various plans. We reserve the right to terminate or make changes to these plans at any time.The components of our net periodic benefit cost for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were as follows: The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 63Table 59: Components of Net Periodic Benefit Cost (a) Qualified Pension Plan  Nonqualified Pension Plan  Postretirement Benefits Three months ended March 31In millions2019 2018  2019 2018  2019 2018 Net periodic cost consists of:              Service cost$28 $28  $1 $1  $1 $1 Interest cost46 43  2 2  3 3 Expected return on plan assets(72) (76)       (1) (1) Amortization of prior service credit1             Amortization of actuarial losses     1 1      Net periodic cost/(benefit)$3 $(5)  $4 $4  $3 $3 (a)The service cost component is included in Personnel expense on the Consolidated Income Statement. All other components are included in Other noninterest expense on the Consolidated Income Statement.NOTE 9 FINANCIAL DERIVATIVESWe use a variety of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process to help manage exposure to market (primarily interest rate) and credit risk inherent in our business activities. We also enter into derivatives with customers to facilitate their risk management activities. Derivatives represent contracts between parties that usually require little or no initial net investment and result in one party delivering cash or another type of asset to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying as specified in the contract.For more information regarding derivatives see Note 1 Accounting Policies and Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our 2018 Form 10-K.The following table presents the notional amounts and gross fair values of all derivative assets and liabilities held by us.64 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QTable 60: Total Gross Derivatives March 31, 2019December 31, 2018In millionsNotional /Contract AmountAsset FairValue (a)Liability FairValue (b)Notional /Contract AmountAsset FairValue (a)Liability FairValue (b)Derivatives used for hedging under GAAP      Interest rate contracts (c):      Fair value hedges$30,701$7 $30,919$7Cash flow hedges21,9463 17,3371Foreign exchange contracts:      Net investment hedges1,008 $291,012$10Total derivatives designated for hedging under GAAP$53,655$10$29$49,268$8$10Derivatives not used for hedging under GAAP      Derivatives used for mortgage banking activities (d):      Interest rate contracts:      Swaps$41,334$14$4$43,084$3Futures (e)4,535  10,658Mortgage-backed commitments6,27764575,771$4739Other9,88026126,509103Subtotal62,0261047366,0225745Derivatives used for customer-related activities:      Interest rate contracts:      Swaps224,1331,7801,213218,4961,3521,432Futures (e)564  914Mortgage-backed commitments2,708692,246710Other22,059832520,1097733Subtotal249,4641,8691,247241,7651,4361,475Commodity contracts:       Swaps4,6201441394,813244238Other1,38715151,4186767Subtotal6,0071591546,231311305Foreign exchange contracts and other23,62418618023,253194192Subtotal279,0952,2141,581271,2491,9411,972Derivatives used for other risk management activities:      Foreign exchange contracts and other8,711402227,90875263Total derivatives not designated for hedging under GAAP$349,832$2,358$1,876$345,179$2,073$2,280Total gross derivatives$403,487$2,368$1,905$394,447$2,081$2,290Less: Impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements 695695688688Less: Cash collateral received/paid 302626 341539Total derivatives $1,371$584$1,052$1,063(a)Included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.(b)Included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.(c)Represents primarily swaps.(d)Includes both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities.(e)Futures contracts settle in cash daily and, therefore, no derivative asset or derivative liability is recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.All derivatives are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. Derivative balances are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet on a net basis taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and, when appropriate, any related cash collateral exchanged with counterparties. Further discussion regarding the offsetting rights associated with these legally enforceable master netting agreements is included in the Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk and Contingent Features section of this Note 9. Any nonperformance risk, including credit risk, is included in the determination of the estimated net fair value of the derivatives. Derivatives Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAPCertain derivatives used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk as part of our asset and liability risk management activities are designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. Derivatives hedging the risks associated with changes in the fair value of assets or liabilities are considered fair value hedges, derivatives hedging the variability of expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges, and derivatives hedging a net investment in a foreign subsidiary are considered net investment hedges. Designating The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 65derivatives as accounting hedges allows for gains and losses on those derivatives to be recognized in the same period and in the same income statement line item as the earnings impact of the hedged items.Fair Value HedgesWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed-rate debt caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps and zero-coupon swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate and zero-coupon investment securities caused by fluctuations in market interest rates. Gains and losses on the interest rate swaps designated in these hedge relationships, along with the offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings within the same income statement line item.Cash Flow HedgesWe enter into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated commercial loans from variable to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in future cash flows due to market interest rate changes. We also periodically enter into forward purchase and sale contracts to hedge the variability of the consideration that will be paid or received related to the purchase or sale of investment securities. The forecasted purchase or sale is consummated upon gross settlement of the forward contract itself. For these cash flow hedges, gains and losses on the interest rate swaps and forward contracts are recorded in AOCI and are then reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged cash flows affect earnings and within the same income statement line as the hedged cash flows.In the 12 months that follow March 31, 2019, we expect to reclassify net derivative losses of $7 million pretax, or $5 million after-tax, from AOCI to interest income for both cash flow hedge strategies. This reclassified amount could differ from amounts actually recognized due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations and the addition of other hedges subsequent to March 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2019, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is ten years.Further detail regarding gains (losses) related to our fair value and cash flow hedge derivatives is presented in the following table.Table 61: Gains (Losses) Recognized on Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges in the Consolidated Income Statement (a) (b) Location and Amount of Gains (Losses) Recognized in Income Interest IncomeInterest ExpenseNoninterest IncomeIn millionsLoansInvestment SecuritiesBorrowed FundsOtherFor the three months ended March 31, 2019    Total amounts on the Consolidated Income Statement$2,602$620$481$308Gains (losses) on fair value hedges recognized on:    Hedged items (c) $58$(274) Derivatives $(55)$228 Amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives $5$11 Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges (d):    Amount of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI$(8)$1$15For the three months ended March 31, 2018    Total amounts on the Consolidated Income Statement$2,228$512$344$245Gains (losses) on fair value hedges recognized on:    Hedged items (c) $(90)$370 Derivatives $92$(370) Amounts related to interest settlements on derivatives $(3)$26 Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges (d):    Amount of derivative gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI$26$4 $2(a)For all periods presented, there were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for any of the fair value or cash flow hedge strategies.

We assess whether the hedging relationship is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the value of the hedge and hedged item by qualitatively verifying that the critical terms of the hedge and hedged item match at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. Net investment hedge derivatives are classified as foreign exchange contracts. There were no components of derivative gains or losses excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness for all periods presented. Net losses on net investment hedge derivatives recognized in OCI were $18 million and $39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments under GAAPWe also enter into derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges under GAAP. For additional information on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under GAAP, see Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our 2018 Form 10-K.Further detail regarding the gains (losses) on derivatives not designated in hedging relationships is presented in the following table.Table 63: Gains (Losses) on Derivatives Not Designated for Hedging under GAAP  Three months endedMarch 31 In millions20192018 Derivatives used for mortgage banking activities:   Interest rate contracts (a)$128$(114) Derivatives used for customer-related activities:   Interest rate contracts(2)56 Foreign exchange contracts and other (b)2344 Gains (losses) from customer-related activities (c)21100 Derivatives used for other risk management activities:   Foreign exchange contracts and other (c)(54)(17) Total gains (losses) from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments$95$(31) (a)Included in Residential mortgage, Corporate services and Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.(b)Includes an insignificant amount of gains (losses) on commodity contracts for all periods presented.(c)Included in Other noninterest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.Offsetting, Counterparty Credit Risk and Contingent FeaturesWe generally utilize a net presentation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for those derivative financial instruments entered into with counterparties under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the closeout netting of all outstanding derivative instruments under the master netting agreement with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of an event of default. The master netting agreement also may require the exchange of cash or marketable securities to collateralize either party’s net position. For additional information on derivative offsetting, counterparty credit risk and contingent features, see Note 13 Financial Derivatives in our 2018 Form 10-K.Table 64 shows the impact legally enforceable master netting agreements had on our derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The table includes cash collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. The table also includes the fair value of any securities collateral held or pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Cash and securities collateral amounts are included in the table only to the extent of the related net derivative fair values.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 67Table 64 includes over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and OTC cleared derivatives. OTC derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties that are not settled through an organized exchange or cleared through a central clearing house. The majority of OTC derivatives are governed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation or other legally enforceable master netting agreements. OTC cleared derivatives represent contracts executed bilaterally with counterparties in the OTC market that are novated to a central clearing house who then becomes our counterparty.

These totals may differ from the amounts presented in the preceding offsetting table because these totals may include collateral exchanged under an agreement that does not qualify as a master netting agreement or because the total amount of collateral 68 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Qheld or pledged exceeds the net derivative fair values with the counterparty as of the balance sheet date due to timing or other factors, such as initial margin. To the extent not netted against the derivative fair values under a master netting agreement, the receivable for cash pledged is included in Other assets and the obligation for cash held is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities held from counterparties are not recognized on our balance sheet. Likewise securities we have pledged to counterparties remain on our balance sheet. Certain derivative agreements contain various credit-risk related contingent provisions, such as those that require our debt to maintain a specified credit rating from one or more of the major credit rating agencies. If our debt ratings were to fall below such specified ratings, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position on March 31, 2019 was $1.1 billion for which we had posted collateral of $.6 billion in the normal course of business. The maximum additional amount of collateral we would have been required to post if the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on March 31, 2019 would be $.5 billion.NOTE 10 EARNINGS PER SHARETable 65: Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share   Three months endedMarch 31In millions, except per share data 2019 2018Basic    Net income $1,271 $1,239Less:    Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 10 10Preferred stock dividends 63 63Preferred stock discount accretion and redemptions 1 1Net income attributable to common shares 1,1971,165Less: Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities 5 5Net income attributable to basic common shares $1,192$1,160Basic weighted-average common shares outstanding 455 473Basic earnings per common share (a) $2.62 $2.45Diluted    Net income attributable to basic common shares $1,192 $1,160Less: Impact of BlackRock earnings per share dilution 3 2Net income attributable to diluted common shares $1,189$1,158Basic weighted-average common shares outstanding 455 473Dilutive potential common shares 1 3Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding 456 476Diluted earnings per common share (a) $2.61 $2.43(a)Basic and diluted earnings per share under the two-class method are determined on net income reported on the income statement less earnings allocated to nonvested restricted shares and restricted share units with nonforfeitable dividends and dividend rights (participating securities).The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 69NOTE 11 TOTAL EQUITY AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEActivity in total equity for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 follows.Table 66: Rollforward of Total Equity    Shareholders’ Equity    In millionsSharesOutstandingCommonStock CommonStockCapitalSurplus -PreferredStockCapitalSurplus -CommonStock andOtherRetainedEarningsAccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncome (Loss)TreasuryStock Non-controllingInterestsTotal Equity Balance at December 31, 2017 (a)473 $2,710$3,985$12,389$35,481$(148)$(6,904) $72$47,585 Cumulative effect of ASU adoptions (b)     (22)6   (16) Balance at January 1, 2018 (a)473 $2,710$3,985$12,389$35,459$(142)$(6,904) $72$47,569 Net income     1,229   101,239 Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax      (557)   (557) Cash dividends declared           Common      (358)    (358) Preferred     (63)    (63) Preferred stock discount accretion   1 (1)     Treasury stock activity(3)   6  (631)  (625) Other    (154)    (16)(170) Balance at March 31, 2018 (a)470 $2,710$3,986$12,241$36,266$(699)$(7,535) $66$47,035 Balance at December 31, 2018 (a)457 $2,711$3,986$12,291$38,919$(725)$(9,454) $42$47,770 Cumulative effect of ASU 2016-02 adoption (c)     62    62 Balance at January 1, 2019 (a)457 $2,711$3,986$12,291$38,981$(725)$(9,454) $42$47,832 Net income     1,261   101,271 Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax      720   720 Cash dividends declared            Common      (436)    (436) Preferred     (63)    (63) Preferred stock discount accretion   1 (1)      Treasury stock activity(5)   10  (631)  (621) Other   3(118)    (13)(128) Balance at March 31, 2019 (a)452 $2,711$3,990$12,183$39,742$(5)$(10,085) $39$48,575 (a)The par value of our preferred stock outstanding was less than $.5 million at each date and, therefore, is excluded from this presentation.(b)Represents the cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-01, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2018-02.

See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies in our 2018 Form 10-K for additional detail on this adoption.NOTE 12 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We establish accruals for legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. When we are able to do so, we also determine estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for disclosed legal proceedings (“Disclosed Matters,” which are those matters disclosed in this Note 12 as well as those matters disclosed in Note 19 Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 8 of our 2018 Form 10-K (such prior disclosure referred to as “Prior Disclosure”)). For Disclosed Matters where we are able to estimate such possible losses or ranges of possible losses, as of March 31, 2019, we estimate that it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses in an aggregate amount less than $100 million. The estimates included in this amount are based on our analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties. As new information is obtained we may change our estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or this aggregate amount.As a result of the types of factors described in Note 19 in our 2018 Form 10-K, we are unable, at this time, to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or ranges of such losses with respect to some of the matters disclosed, and the aggregate estimated amount provided above does not include an estimate for every Disclosed Matter. Therefore, as the estimated aggregate amount disclosed above does not include all of the Disclosed Matters, the amount disclosed above does not represent our maximum reasonably possible loss exposure for all of the Disclosed Matters. The estimated aggregate amount also does not reflect any of our exposure to matters not so disclosed, as discussed below under “Other.”We include in some of the descriptions of individual Disclosed Matters certain quantitative information related to the plaintiff’s claim against us as alleged in the plaintiff’s pleadings or other public filings or otherwise publicly available information. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual.Some of our exposure in Disclosed Matters may be offset by applicable insurance coverage. We do not consider the possible availability of insurance coverage in determining the amounts of any accruals (although we record the amount of related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable up to the amount of the accrual) or in determining any estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses.DD Growth Premium Master FundIn March 2019, the parties to the proceedings brought by the liquidator of the DD Growth Premium Master Fund (DD Growth) and pending in the High Court, Dublin, Ireland entered into a settlement agreement to resolve this lawsuit. The settlement is conditioned, among other things, on court approval in the Cayman Islands where DD Growth is organized. PNC and BNY Mellon have agreed on the amount of PNC’s contribution to this settlement, which is not material. Other Regulatory and Governmental InquiriesWe are the subject of investigations, audits and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry covering a broad range of issues in our consumer, mortgage, brokerage, securities and other financial services businesses, as well as other aspects of our operations. In some 72 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Qcases, these inquiries are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at PNC individually. These inquiries, including those described in Prior Disclosure, may lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, and possibly result in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, or alterations in our business practices, and in additional expenses and collateral costs and other consequences. These inquiries may result in significant reputational harm or other adverse collateral consequences even if direct resulting remedies are not material to us. Our practice is to cooperate fully with regulatory and governmental investigations, audits and other inquiries, including those described in Prior Disclosure.OtherIn addition to the proceedings or other matters described above and in Prior Disclosure, PNC and persons to whom we may have indemnification obligations, in the normal course of business, are subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages and other relief are asserted. We do not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we cannot now determine whether or not any claims asserted against us or others to whom we may have indemnification obligations, whether in the proceedings or other matters described above or otherwise, will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any future reporting period, which will depend on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the claim and the amount of income otherwise reported for the reporting period.NOTE 13 COMMITMENTSIn the normal course of business, we have various commitments outstanding, certain of which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table presents our outstanding commitments to extend credit along with significant other commitments as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Table 70: Commitments to Extend Credit and Other Commitments In millionsMarch 312019 December 312018 Commitments to extend credit    Total commercial lending$122,014 $120,165 Home equity lines of credit17,094 16,944 Credit card28,187 27,100 Other5,844 5,069 Total commitments to extend credit173,139 169,278 Net outstanding standby letters of credit (a)9,236 8,655 Reinsurance agreements (b)1,492 1,549 Standby bond purchase agreements (c)1,145 1,000 Other commitments (d)1,472 1,130 Total commitments to extend credit and other commitments$186,484 $181,612 (a)Net outstanding standby letters of credit include $3.7 billion at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, which support remarketing programs.(b)Represents aggregate maximum exposure up to the specified limits of the reinsurance contracts provided by our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. These amounts reflect estimates based on availability of financial information from insurance carriers. As of both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the aggregate maximum exposure amount comprised $1.3 billion for accidental death & dismemberment contracts and $.2 billion for credit life, accident and health contracts.(c)We enter into standby bond purchase agreements to support municipal bond obligations.(d)Includes $.5 billion related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.Commitments to Extend CreditCommitments to extend credit, or net unfunded loan commitments, represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, may require payment of a fee, and generally contain termination clauses in the event the customer’s credit quality deteriorates.Net Outstanding Standby Letters of CreditWe issue standby letters of credit and share in the risk of standby letters of credit issued by other financial institutions, in each case to support obligations of our customers to third parties, such as insurance requirements and the facilitation of transactions involving capital markets product execution. Approximately 98% of our net outstanding standby letters of credit were rated as Pass as of March 31, 2019, with the remainder rated as Criticized. An internal credit rating of Pass indicates the expected risk of loss is currently low, while a rating of Criticized indicates a higher degree of risk.The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 73If the customer fails to meet its financial or performance obligation to the third party under the terms of the contract or there is a need to support a remarketing program, then upon a draw by a beneficiary, subject to the terms of the letter of credit, we would be obligated to make payment to them. The standby letters of credit outstanding on March 31, 2019 had terms ranging from less than one year to six years.As of March 31, 2019, assets of $1.0 billion secured certain specifically identified standby letters of credit. In addition, a portion of the remaining standby letters of credit issued on behalf of specific customers is also secured by collateral or guarantees that secure the customers’ other obligations to us. The carrying amount of the liability for our obligations related to standby letters of credit and participations in standby letters of credit was $.2 billion at March 31, 2019 and is included in Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.NOTE 14 SEGMENT REPORTINGWe have four reportable business segments:•Retail Banking•Corporate & Institutional Banking•Asset Management Group•BlackRockResults of individual businesses are presented based on our internal management reporting practices. There is no comprehensive, authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to GAAP; therefore, the financial results of our individual businesses are not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other company. We periodically refine our internal methodologies as management reporting practices are enhanced. To the extent significant and practicable, retrospective application of new methodologies is made to prior period reportable business segment results and disclosures to create comparability with the current period.Total business segment financial results differ from total consolidated net income. The impact of these differences is reflected in the “Other” category in the business segment tables. “Other” includes residual activities that do not meet the criteria for disclosure as a separate reportable business, such as asset and liability management activities including net securities gains or losses, other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities, certain trading activities, certain runoff consumer loan portfolios, private equity investments, intercompany eliminations, certain corporate overhead, tax adjustments that are not allocated to business segments, gains or losses related to BlackRock transactions, exited businesses and differences between business segment performance reporting and financial statement reporting (GAAP), including the presentation of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as the segments’ results exclude their portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Financial results are presented, to the extent practicable, as if each business operated on a stand-alone basis. Additionally, we have aggregated the results for corporate support functions within “Other” for financial reporting purposes.Net interest income in business segment results reflects our internal funds transfer pricing methodology. Assets receive a funding charge and liabilities and capital receive a funding credit based on a transfer pricing methodology that incorporates product repricing characteristics, tenor and other factors.A portion of capital is intended to cover unexpected losses and is assigned to our business segments using our risk-based economic capital model, including consideration of the goodwill at those business segments, as well as the diversification of risk among the business segments, ultimately reflecting our portfolio risk adjusted capital allocation.We have allocated the allowances for loan and lease losses and for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit based on the loan exposures within each business segment’s portfolio. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.74 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QBusiness Segment ResultsTable 71: Results of Businesses Three months ended March 31In millions Retail Banking Corporate &InstitutionalBanking AssetManagementGroup BlackRock Other Consolidated (a) 2019            Income Statement            Net interest income $1,349 $877 $70   $179 $2,475Noninterest income 595 576 217 $233 190 1,811Total revenue 1,944 1,453 287 233 369 4,286Provision for credit losses (benefit) 128 71 (1)   (9) 189Depreciation and amortization 51 50 12   121 234Other noninterest expense 1,417 636 218   73 2,344Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 348 696 58 233 184 1,519Income taxes (benefit) 84 144 13 36 (29) 248Net income $264 $552 $45 $197 $213 $1,271Average Assets (b) $91,255 $157,169 $7,259 $8,080 $122,135 $385,8982018            Income Statement            Net interest income $1,218 $861 $74   $208 $2,361Noninterest income 635 547 226 $235 107 1,750Total revenue 1,853 1,408 300 235 315 4,111Provision for credit losses (benefit) 69 41 (7)   (11) 92Depreciation and amortization 45 48 12   128 233Other noninterest expense 1,411 605 213   65 2,294Income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 328 714 82 235 133 1,492Income taxes (benefit) 79 151 20 38 (35) 253Net income $249 $563 $62 $197 $168 $1,239Average Assets (b) $88,734 $151,909 $7,499 $7,704 $120,429 $376,275(a)There were no material intersegment revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.(b)Period-end balances for BlackRock.Business Segment Products and Services Retail Banking provides deposit, lending, brokerage, insurance services, investment management and cash management products and services to consumer and small business customers.

Our leases have remaining lease terms of one year to sixty-two years, some of which may include options to renew the leases for up to ninety-nine years, and some of which may include options to terminate the leases prior to the end date. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased asset. The exercise of lease renewal, termination and purchase options is at our sole discretion.At adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, we elected to account for the lease and nonlease components of existing real estate leases and leases of advertising assets, such as signage, as a single lease component. Effective January 1, 2019, lease and nonlease components of new lease agreements will be accounted for separately. Lease components include fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs and nonlease components include common-area maintenance costs. Generally, we have elected to use the Overnight Indexed Swap rate corresponding to the term of the lease at the lease measurement date as our incremental borrowing rate to measure the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of revenue and others include rental payments if certain bank deposit levels are met. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Subleases to third parties were not material.Operating and finance lease assets and liabilities at March 31, 2019 were as follows:Table 76: Leases In millionsMarch 31, 2019Assets Operating$2,041Finance103Total lease assets$2,144Liabilities Operating$2,198Finance109Total lease liabilities$2,307Future undiscounted cash flows on our operating and finance leases are as follows:Table 77: Maturity of Lease Liabilities  March 31, 2019In millionsOperating LeasesFinance LeasesTotal LeasesRemainder of 2019$266$31$2972020342363782021313273402022275628120232432245After 20231,015121,027Total lease payments$2,454$114$2,568Less: Interest(256)(5)Present value of lease liabilities$2,198$109At December 31, 2018, operating lease commitments under lesee arrangements were $374 million, $346 million, $308 million, $258 million, $228 million for 2019 through 2023, respectively, and $941 million in the aggregate for all years thereafter.

The impact of financial derivatives used in interest rate risk management is included in the interest income/expense and average yields/rates of the related assets and liabilities. Basis adjustments related to hedged items are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities. Average balances of securities are based on amortized historical cost (excluding adjustments to fair value, which are included in other assets). Average balances for certain loans and borrowed funds accounted for at fair value are included in noninterest-earning assets and noninterest-bearing liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in Noninterest income.(b)Loan fees for the three months ended March 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and March 31, 2018 were $28 million, $40 million and $32 million, respectively. (c)Interest income calculated as taxable-equivalent interest income. To provide more meaningful comparisons of interest income and yields for all interest-earning assets, as well as net interest margins, we use interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating average yields and net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under GAAP. See Reconciliation of Taxable-Equivalent Net Interest Income in this Statistical Information section for more information.82 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-QRECONCILIATION OF TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME (NON-GAAP) (a)   Three months ended In millions March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 March 31, 2018 Net interest income (GAAP) $2,475 $2,481 $2,361 Taxable-equivalent adjustments 27 28 29 Net interest income (Non-GAAP) $2,502 $2,509 $2,390 (a)The interest income earned on certain interest-earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax.
